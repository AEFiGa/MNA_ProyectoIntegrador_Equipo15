Hotel Football the business venture run by Gary Neville and his former Manchester United teammate Ryan Giggs has spent over ¬£3 million in the past two years hosting NHS staff.

Two hotels both in Manchester closed to the public in March 2020 and were made available to health workers who were not able to live with their families during the covid pandemic free of charge.

Former England footballer Neville spoke out on Saturday after several media outlets reported that Hotel Football had lost a staggering ¬£3m in two years and owes ¬£10m in loans.

Many of the reports failed to mention just how much Neville and Giggs did during the pandemic to support their staff and the country‚Äôs medical staff.

Can i just sort your headline out for you üëáüèª ‚Äò Hotel owners maintain and pay all staff 100% of their wages in a global pandemic  whilst also hosting 120 medical professionals and nurses  who were sheltering from vulnerable family members at no cost to the NHS for 9 months‚Äô https://t.co/5a9cUOQ8EA ‚Äî Gary Neville (@GNev2) September 3 2022

Speaking to PoliticsJOE Neville said: ‚ÄúWe funded the ¬£3m over 2 years with either our own cash or loans and paid our staff in full.

‚ÄúWe also looked after the NHS staff locally that couldn‚Äôt stay at home in the first wave of the pandemic.‚Äù

The luxurious Stock Exchange Hotel in Manchester had been open only five months before it closed its doors shortly after being named one of the World‚Äôs Best New Luxury Hotels for 2020.

‚ÄúWe look after our teams and we wanted to offer some support at a worrying time for everyone‚Äù said Neville.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôd also seen in Italy that doctors and nurses were struggling to find accommodation away from vulnerable family members so we partnered with the Manchester NHS foundation trust.

‚ÄúWe were the first to do it and we were pretty full for the whole first wave in Hotel Football and had 25-30 in the Stock Exchange hotel.‚Äù

Writing on twitter Cystic Fibrosis physiotherapist Nicole Petch said she had been one of the staff hosted in Hotel Football during the pandemic.

‚ÄúI stayed at Hotel Football during the first wave of the pandemic‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThank you so much for your kindness generosity & allowing me to keep my family safe.‚Äù

Splashdown Quay West Water Park at Goodrington is set to expand in a ¬£3m ‚Äúonce in a lifetime‚Äù revamp. And members of Torbay Council‚Äôs planning committee are being recommended to say yes.

The park‚Äôs owners plan new water slides better facilities for young families and an indoor climbing centre among other new developments. Quaywest already boasts a collection of flumes and water chutes which have been a hit with visitors to Torbay for decades.

Operators Lemur Attractions signed a new long-term lease on the site last year and will take three to five years to complete the ¬£3m revamp. Managing director Alan Richmond said the investment would secure the future of the water park and leisure facilities for many years to come.

A new beach cafe and wet weather attractions will be among the new developments. Areas including the old Peter Pan Play Park area beside the main flumes and the former go-kart track will be redeveloped.

Mr Richmond told Devon Live the new facilities would make the park more attractive to families with younger children. There will also be a new ‚Äúsignature slide‚Äù in the main flumes area which could be ready in time for the 2023 season.

He said the council had been ‚Äúenthusiastic and encouraging‚Äù over the plans which were a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. And he said the development would be sensitive to the area. The water park was originally built in the late 1980s and is the largest outdoor water park in the UK.

In a report to the council planners Torbay‚Äôs development agency the TDA describes the plan as ‚Äúexciting‚Äù and says the new indoor play and climbing centre will give Torbay a valuable all-year-round attractions. It also welcomes the creation of 26 new full-time jobs and 126 part-time.

The committee will be told that the development is in line with the Local Plan and will not harm the character of the area. Trees cut down during the building will be replaced although the loss of one large sycamore is described as ‚Äúunfortunate‚Äù.

Members will be advised when they meet on September 12 to say yes to the plan providing the developers meet conditions on flooding drainage car parking and landscaping.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said this week that rape victims in his state can take Plan B a pregnancy-preventing emergency contraceptive known as a ‚Äúmorning-after pill.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe want to support those victims but also those victims can access health care immediately as well as to report it‚Äù Abbott said in a pre-recorded interview with KXAS-TV and The Dallas Morning News slated to air on Sunday the newspaper reported.

‚ÄúBy accessing health care immediately they can get the Plan B pill that can prevent a pregnancy from occurring in the first place. With regard to reporting it to law enforcement that will ensure that the rapist will be arrested and prosecuted‚Äù Abbott added according to the Morning News.

CNN has reached out to Abbott‚Äôs office for comment.

Texas‚Äô abortion trigger-law which passed in 2021 in anticipation of the repeal of Roe v. Wade went into effect last month putting in place new criminal penalties for abortion and offering an exemption only for certain health emergencies.

The Lone Star State bars abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy which is one of the strictest in the nation and prohibits abortion before many people know they are pregnant. Under the Texas law abortion is prohibited when a fetal heartbeat is detected.

In developed countries where abortion is legal none have set a gestation limit as early as six weeks according to the Center for Reproductive Rights which campaigns for improved access to abortion.

The US Food and Drug Administration approved Plan B in 1999. The key ingredient in the pill is a synthetic hormone called levonorgestrel. This drug stops an egg from being released from the ovary or preventing fertilization of the egg by sperm.

If there has been fertilization Plan B may prevent a fertilized egg from embedding in the uterus. But if the egg has already been implanted in the uterus the morning-after pill will not work.

Emergency contraceptives are intended for use within 72 hours after sex but are most effective if taken within 24 hours.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3Mvc3RhdGUtd2F0Y2gvMzYyNzAwNi10ZXhhcy1nb3Zlcm5vci1zYXlzLXJhcGUtdmljdGltcy1jYW4tcHJldmVudC1wcmVnbmFuY3ktYnktdGFraW5nLXBsYW4tYi_SAX1odHRwczovL3RoZWhpbGwuY29tL2hvbWVuZXdzL3N0YXRlLXdhdGNoLzM2MjcwMDYtdGV4YXMtZ292ZXJub3Itc2F5cy1yYXBlLXZpY3RpbXMtY2FuLXByZXZlbnQtcHJlZ25hbmN5LWJ5LXRha2luZy1wbGFuLWIvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Abbott says rape victims in Texas can prevent pregnancy by taking Plan B,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/3627006-texas-governor-says-rape-victims-can-prevent-pregnancy-by-taking-plan-b/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3Mvc3RhdGUtd2F0Y2gvMzYyNzAwNi10ZXhhcy1nb3Zlcm5vci1zYXlzLXJhcGUtdmljdGltcy1jYW4tcHJldmVudC1wcmVnbmFuY3ktYnktdGFraW5nLXBsYW4tYi_SAX1odHRwczovL3RoZWhpbGwuY29tL2hvbWVuZXdzL3N0YXRlLXdhdGNoLzM2MjcwMDYtdGV4YXMtZ292ZXJub3Itc2F5cy1yYXBlLXZpY3RpbXMtY2FuLXByZXZlbnQtcHJlZ25hbmN5LWJ5LXRha2luZy1wbGFuLWIvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzAzL2dyZWctYWJib3R0LXRleGFzLXJhcGUtdmljdGltcy1hYm9ydGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Victims of rape can take emergency contraception Texas' Greg Abbott says,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2022/09/03/greg-abbott-texas-rape-victims-abortion on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzAzL2dyZWctYWJib3R0LXRleGFzLXJhcGUtdmljdGltcy1hYm9ydGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9ncmVnLWFiYm90dC1zbGFtbWVkLXNheWluZy1yYXBlLXZpY3RpbXMtdGFrZS1wbGFuLWItbW9ybmluZy1hZnRlci1waWxsLTE3Mzk2OTjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Greg Abbott Slammed After Saying Rape Victims Can Take Plan B Pill,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.newsweek.com/greg-abbott-slammed-saying-rape-victims-take-plan-b-morning-after-pill-1739698 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9ncmVnLWFiYm90dC1zbGFtbWVkLXNheWluZy1yYXBlLXZpY3RpbXMtdGFrZS1wbGFuLWItbW9ybmluZy1hZnRlci1waWxsLTE3Mzk2OTjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Hayek apparently spent some of her day cruising on a boat while rocking out to Stevie Wonder's ‚ÄúHappy Birthday to You.‚Äù She was wearing a hot red bikini and a clip of the moment was posted on her Instagram timeline to a grateful audience.

‚ÄúHappy 56th birthday to me!!! Feliz cumplea√±os #56 para mi‚Äù she captioned the joyful moment hashtagging it #alwaysgrateful.

The comments were full of well-wishes from other celebrities including Zoe Saldana Drake Anthony Hopkins and Blake Lively. There were also quite a lot of people admiring her bathing suit figure. Hayek's been asked about her workout routine throughout her life and said in December 2020 to People that she doesn't really have one explaining that she doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúhave time to exercise‚Äù but she does practice a form of restorative yoga.

‚ÄúI work with a woman in London who taught me how to hold my body in a way where the muscles are activated all day long‚Äù said Hayek. ‚ÄúSo even when you brush your teeth you‚Äôre working the muscles.

She continued ‚ÄúShe taught me to tone my muscles without clenching them...You relax them and focus on the parts that need to be used but never with tension. If you‚Äôre aware of your body you‚Äôd be surprised by the effect it can have.‚Äù

Hayek says she doesn't ‚Äúdiet‚Äù either but admitted that she often depends on juice cleanses for mental clarity.

‚ÄúCleansing is like my meditation‚Äù she claimed. ‚ÄúIt makes me stop focus and think about what I‚Äôm putting into my body. I‚Äôm making a commitment to my health and hitting the reset button.‚Äù

It seems like alongside Ja Morant and his signature Nike model the Nike Ja Jayson Tatum will be receiving his very own Jordan model in the near future being dubbed the Jordan Tatum 1 (name subject to change). Just like the Nike Ja we unfortunately don‚Äôt have any looks at the silhouette just yet however we do know that three colorways are set to launch next year. Coming inspired by his son Deuce and some of Tatum‚Äôs favorite things we know that there are plans for a ‚ÄúZoo‚Äù St. Louis‚Äù and ‚ÄúPink Lemonade‚Äù rendition of the Tatum 1. Being that he was born in St. Louis it only makes sense one of his sneakers would get dressed in Cardinals-inspired colors while the zoo is one of the places he loves to take Deuce. As one of his favorite drinks pink lemonade is making another appearance on one of his sneakers just like the AJ 35 PE that he was spotted in back in 2020.

Before she even got onstage the former QAnon supporter was repeating debunked right-wing myths including false claims that public schools in places like Texas Nebraska Pennsylvania are lowering tables and putting out litter boxes for students who are ‚Äúfurries‚Äù that dress or self-identify as cats.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre embracing lies literally embracing lies‚Äù Ms Greene told reporters outside the event. ‚ÄúIf some student wants to pretend like a cat and use a litterbox after school that‚Äôs their prerogative whatever. But no the school the school resources and the other students and teachers should not have to be put through that because it‚Äôs a lie and we have to reject them.‚Äù

When it came time to speak Ms Greene continued to make false statements including that Donald Trump won the 2020 election.

‚ÄúPresident Trump won the 2020 election‚Äù she said onstage to huge applause. ‚ÄúWe know president Trump won.‚Äù

The far-right Georgia representative also called for White House medical advisor Dr Anthony Fauci to be thrown in jail.

‚ÄúHe thinks he‚Äôs going to retire‚Äîlet me tell you something I think that man belongs in jail‚Äù she continued.

The Independent has contacted Ms Greene for comment.

She wasn‚Äôt the only one making wild claims at the Pennsylvania rally.

Mr Trump baselessly accused Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman of using a variety of illegal drugs.

He compared the lieutenant governor known for his trademark campaign trail uniform of hoodies and shorts to ‚Äúa teenager getting high in his parents basement‚Äù and called him a ‚Äúraging lunatic‚Äù who not only supports legalisation of illicit drugs but partakes of them personally.

‚ÄúFetterman supports taxpayer funded drug dens and the complete decriminalization of illegal drugs including heroin cocaine crystal meth and ultra lethal fentanyl‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd by the way he takes them himself‚Äù.

There is no evidence this is true.

Mr Fetterman supports the decriminalisation and federal descheduling of marijuana for medical and criminal justice reasons.

His campaign told The Independent Mr Trump‚Äôs claims were ‚Äúlies from Trump‚Äù from someone who is ‚Äúdesperate and sad.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9uZWFybHktODAwLXBlZGFsLWNhcnMtc2FsZS0xNjAxMDA5NjQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nearly 800 Pedal Cars up for Sale in a Single Auction This Month,"Photo credit: Mecum Auctions

They might have been toys once but classic pedal cars can now be considered collector's items and Mecum Auctions will attempt to unload hundreds of them at an auction later this month.

The lot comes from Elmer's Auto & Toy Museum and includes some that are 100 years old some that are in relatively original condition and others that have been heavily restored or modified.

Aside from the pedal cars Mecum will also be selling 120 classic cars as part of this auction including a 1964 Amphicar 770.

Pedal car enthusiasts out there might want to start measuring their available storage. The Elmer‚Äôs Auto & Toy Museum is selling a significant portion of its collection through Mecum Auctions later this month and the lot includes almost 800 classic pedal cars.

Some of these classics are 100 years old like a 1920s Steelcraft Buick pedal car or a 1927 American National Lincoln pedal car with many original parts like the windshield frame hood ornament and spare disc tire. The current bid is $100. The 1950s Hamilton Jeep Wrecker with two horns (obviously great for kids) and an AMF Red Mustang also caught our eye.

Most of the pedal cars up for auction have been updated and repainted over the years. If you're thinking of getting these not to be kept as a collectible but for kids to actually ride on we think the pedal airplanes‚Äîbasically pedal cars with stubby little wings on the sides‚Äîor pedal cars with airplanes painted on their sides like the blue and white Strato-Flite pedal car pictured below might do the trick. If the little ones enjoy role-playing adult work then perhaps check out the customized Mack C-Cab pedal car painted to look like a Conoco oil truck.

If your tastes run more to pedal cars that aren't pedal cars anymore Elmer's Auto & Toy Museum has you covered with a Champion model that has been restored and then modified and turned into a remote-control (RC) car. It even comes with a doll ""driver.""

There are almost 2000 items from Elmer's Auto & Toy Museum included in the auction lot including plenty without any reserve limit. Aside from the pedal cars there are more than 230 bicycles and tricycles and around 120 sleds carriages and ride-on toys. A handful of classic full-size vehicles about 120 will also be sold.

Story continues

The auction runs from September 14‚Äì17. Bidders can name their price in person via phone or on the Internet but must be registered before bidding. New ride-on pedal cars can cost anywhere between $100 and $1000.

Hannah Layfield and Carl Edwards check out the design of Edwards' car for Sunday's race.

Carl Edwards loves to talk about perspective.

""Ten years ago I was living in my mother's basement"" said the 32-year-old Edwards who grew up in Missouri and now is one of the top drivers in NASCAR. ""People laughed at me when they heard what I wanted to do for a living. But now I'm living my dream.""

Saturday Edwards won the Nationwide Series race at Atlanta Motor Speedway and Sunday the fourth-ranked driver will compete in Sprint Cup's AdvoCare 500. It's been a good few weeks for Edwards as he recently re-signed with Roush-Fenway Racing to continue driving his No. 99 Aflac Ford Fusion for about $40 million.

""I have to remember that my life isn't normal. My family had so much difficulty supporting me a few years ago"" said Edwards who started dirt track racing in 1997 and moved through every level before making it to the biggest stage. ""They weren't sure this auto racing thing would work out. They just didn't have the money to do it. It was a pretty stressful time. Now it's time for me to give back.""

Edwards along with sponsor Aflac have teamed to support this year's National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. As part of the company's ""Friends of a Feather"" campaign Edwards will drive a specially painted car in Sunday's race. The design features duck feathers from front to back inscribed with names of the many unsung heroes who have gone the extra mile for 12-year-old Hannah Layfield a patient at the Aflac Cancer Center and Blood Disorders Service at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. Hannah like so many children facing cancer has an army of devoted people who have stood by her and her family during her multiple bouts with leukemia.

""I was a kid who grew up with normal problems. It's nothing like what these kids are going through"" said Edwards who visits the center often when he's in town. ""They have so much humility and strength. I mistakenly thought I would be there to inspire them. But in fact it's the opposite. They show me strength.""

Over the past 15 years Aflac has helped raise more than $65 million to help end childhood cancer. In its latest campaign on Aflac's Facebook page fans can make donations and Aflac will double the amount.

""This is an amazing program. I don't give back nearly enough. I haven't taken the time that I should and I want to change that"" Edwards said. ""When you look at what these kids are going through you realize that just trying to be a race car driver isn't as important as just trying to live. It's all about perspective.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the role of Yap1 and Taz (Wwtr1) in aging HSPCs we analyzed their expression in LK (Linneg Sca-1neg c-Kitpos) and LSK (Linneg Sca-1pos c-Kitpos) cells from young and old mice (for exemplary flow cytometry profiles see Supplementary Fig. 1). Wwtr1 mRNA as well as the Taz Protein were both strikingly induced in old LSK (oLSK) whereas Yap1 expression remained unchanged (Fig. 1a‚Äìc).

Fig. 1: TAZ (Wwtr1) is strongly induced in oLT-HSCs. a Representative flow cytometry plots of LK (Lineageneg Sca-1neg c-Kitpos) and LSK (Lineageneg Sca-1pos c-Kitpos) cells of young and old mice. b qRT-PCRs of Wwtr1 and Yap1 expression in LK and LSK isolated from young and old mice (n = 4 per age group one-way ANOVA with Tukey HSD post hoc test). c Immunoblot analysis of TAZ in LK and LSK of young and old mice. d Representative flow cytometry plots of LT-HSCs ST-HSCs and MPP in the LSK compartment of young and old mice. e Overview of the samples that were analyzed by RNA-Seq (n = 3 per group). f Principal component analysis of the RNA-Seq of the indicated populations (n = 3 per group). g Summary of gene expression changes (old vs. young) of Hippo pathway core components. h Volcano plot encompassing all transcriptional regulators (KEGG database) that were analyzed in the LT-HSC dataset old vs. young.

To analyze gene expression changes in the LSK compartment in greater detail we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) from long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs: LSK CD34neg CD135neg) short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs: LSK CD34pos CD135neg) and multipotent progenitors (MPPs: LSK CD34pos CD135pos) from young and old mice (Fig. 1d e). As expected the number of immunophenotypic LT-HSCs was strongly increased in old mice (Supplementary Fig. 2a).

ST-HSCs and MPPs showed a weaker age-dependent separation in principal component analyses whereas old LT-HSCs (oLT-HSCs) were more clearly separable from young LT-HSCs (yLT-HSCs) and showed the highest number of differentially expressed genes between old and young (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 2b). Although most Hippo core components showed only weak or no age-dependent changes Wwtr1 was strongly increased specifically in LT-HSCs and old human HSPCs (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 2c). Yap1 on the other hand was barely expressed in LT-HSCs demonstrating that Wwtr1 is the predominant transcriptional Hippo effector in these cells (Supplementary Fig. 2d).

Strikingly Wwtr1 was the most potently induced transcriptional regulator when comparing oLT-HSCs vs. yLT-HSCs (Fig. 1h).

To identify TAZ-dependent target genes in HSPCs we lentivirally overexpressed the constitutively active TAZ S89A point mutant in freshly isolated LSKs and subsequently performed RNA-Seq (Fig. 1i j). A TAZ-induced gene set consisting of 169 genes was then used to probe TAZ activity in HSCs (Fig. 1k and Supplementary Table 1). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) demonstrated that Taz-induced genes were upregulated in oLT-HSCs compared to oST-HSCs and in oLT-HSCs compared to yLT-HSCs (Fig. 1k). These results show that Taz is active in oLT-HSCs and contributes to aging-dependent gene expression changes.

Clca3a1 is induced by Taz and marks oLT-HSCs

To filter for TAZ-induced genes specific of oLT-HSCs we intersected the Taz overexpression RNA-Seq performed in LSKs with the previous RNA-Seq of young and old HSPCs (Fig. 2a). We obtained a relatively concise set of 24 genes that is also strongly induced in independent datasets (Supplementary Fig. 3a) which we refer to as aged LT-HSC-Taz signature (aLT-Taz signature). In the aLT-Taz signature Calcium-activated chloride channel regulator 1 (Clca3a1) coding an accessory protein for calcium-activated chloride channels demonstrated one of the most striking aging-dependent change in LT-HSCs (Fig. 2b). Clca3a1 expression just like the TAZ target gene Amotl2 strictly followed Wwtr1 expression in the different HSPC populations suggesting that CLCA3A1 may be used to trace TAZ activity in vivo (Fig. 2c). Remarkably Wwtr1 Amotl2 and Clca3a1 were all part of an aging HSC (aHSC) signature (Supplementary Table 1) generated by a meta-analysis of sixteen transcriptomic datasets of aged HSCs17 underlining the robustness of our results.

CLCA3A1 was barely detectable by flow cytometry in young LSK populations but specifically induced in old LT-HSCs (Fig. 2d e and Supplementary Fig. 1). CLCA3A1low HSCs purified from old animals were less quiescent than yHSCs. It took them significantly shorter to complete their first cell division in vitro18 (Fig. 2f) a typical phenotype of oHSCs19. CLCA3A1low cells demonstrated a significantly higher Ki67 positivity potentially because they showed a ~3x higher Cdk6 expression and thus were more Cdk6-dependent for cell division (Supplementary Fig. 3b‚Äìe).

RNA-Seq analysis of sorted CLCA3A1high and CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs (Fig. 2g) identified a high number of DEGs: 1169 upregulated (FDR < 0.01) and 1489 downregulated (FDR < 0.01) in CLCA3A1high vs CLCA3A1low.

Notably the aLT-Taz signature was significantly upregulated (p = 1.2e‚àí7) in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs (Fig. 2g) showing that CLCA3A1 is a proxy for TAZ activity.

To analyze the relative contribution of the aging-dependent increase in the frequency of CLCA3A1high cells to the overall transcriptome changes during HSCs aging we compared the CLCA3A1 RNA-Seq with the old vs. young LT-HSCs RNA-Seq (Fig. 2g). Strikingly the vast majority of genes that were upregulated in CLCA3A1high cells were also upregulated in old vs. young LT-HSCs not only in our data but also in an independent RNA-Seq study7 comparing old and young LT-HSCs (Supplementary Fig. 3f). The same was true for the downregulated genes. Thus the up- and downregulated genes in CLCA3A1high cells significantly overlap with the genes up- and downregulated in oLT-HSCs (Fig. 2h). When Clca3a1 is knocked out in yHSCs in vivo20 Clca3a1 seemed to be required to maintain the HSC pool suggesting that this TAZ-induced gene also has a function in young HSCs (Supplementary Fig. 4). However we focus here on the upstream coactivator Taz because it regulates a variety of different genes that can affect the ageing phenotype.

CLCA3A1high/TAZhigh HSCs mark a specific oHSC subpopulation

To investigate the heterogeneity of Taz-dependent transcription programs in HSPCs at the single-cell level independently of any surface marker we analyzed the transcriptome of young LSK (yLSK) and oLSK by Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-Seq)21. We labeled LSKs with antibody-derived tags (ADTs) for the SLAM marker panel CD150 and CD48 as well as CLCA3A1 to validate our findings with an independent set of HSC surface markers. Based on the activity of specific gene sets (Supplementary Table 1) we were able to identify individual cells with different activities for LT-HSCs ST-HSCs and MPPs (Fig. 2i).

Graph-based clustering identified six clusters (clusters 0‚Äì5) in the single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) dataset from young and old LSK cells (Fig. 2j). With the help of the SLAM ADTs and gene set activities22 we identified cluster 1 as a cluster enriched for LT-HSC (Fig. 2j‚Äìm and Supplementary Fig. 3g h). Since functional studies would be required to demonstrate their functionality as LT-HSCs we refer to this cluster as ‚ÄòHSC-like cluster‚Äô. It contained cells expressing high Taz on mRNA level (Fig. 2k) high CLCA3A1 on protein level (Fig. 2l) and showing high activity for a CLCA3A1high gene set (Fig. 2m). CLCA3A1high were much more abundant in the aged population (Fig. 2k l) within the HSC-like cluster‚Äô. Only very few scattered yLSKs demonstrated high CLCA3A1 protein level or a high Clca3a1 gene set activity (Fig. 2l m and Supplementary Fig. 3i) suggesting that CLCA3A1high cells also exist to a minor extent in young animals. TAZ activity just like CLCA3A1 activity was largely limited to the HSC-like cluster and was strongly induced in old cells within this cluster (Fig. 2n).

The CLCA3A1high gene set activity strongly correlated with the activity of two independent LT-HSC-specific gene sets (Fig. 2o) one based on our own RNA-Seq data and one previously published23.

In summary CLCA3A1high/TAZhigh HSCs represent a specific and highly abundant population within the oHSC compartment. They are characterized by high expression of genes that qualify them as LT-HSCs but are transcriptionally distinct from yHSCs.

Old CLCA3A1low HSCs show features of ‚Äúyoung-like‚Äù HSCs

To test whether the surface marker CLCA3A1 is sufficient to isolate a pure fraction of oHSCs and ‚Äúyoung-like‚Äù HSCs from old mice we compared our CLCA3A1high signature with the aHSC signature. Both signatures nearly perfectly correlated at the single-cell level indicating that CLCA3A1 is an excellent marker to isolate oHSCs (Fig. 3a b). Remarkably a substantial number of old cells with low CLCA3A1high gene set activity were present in the HSC-like cluster (Fig. 3c) suggesting that a CLCA3A1low immunophenotype marks individual ‚Äúyoung-like‚Äù HSCs within the pool of oHSCs.

Data in f g are presented as mean values +/‚àí SEM. Source data are provided as a Source data file. Full size image

In accordance with the aged phenotype of CLCA3A1high HSCs CLCA3A1 induction also correlated with a gene expression profile of myeloid-biased LT-HSCs (MyLT-HSCs)24 at the single-cell level (Supplementary Fig. 5a) and in the bulk RNA-Seq dataset (Fig. 3d). Consistently Clca3a1 expression clearly correlated with the expression of CD150 a marker of MyLT-HSC in flow cytometry analyses (Fig. 3e).

Given the fundamental differences between CLCA3A1low and CLCA3A1high HSCs at multiple levels we next tested whether these two cell populations also differ functionally. To this end we analyzed their long-term repopulating capacity and their long-term multilineage reconstitution potential in competitive repopulation assays. Two expected hallmarks of oLT-HSCs in this assay are functional decline in long-term repopulation and myeloid skewing of peripheral blood (PB) cells. We transplanted CD45.2-expressing CLCA3A1high or CLCA3A1ow LT-HSCs together with CD45.1/2 competitor cells into lethally irradiated CD45.1 (Ly5.1) recipient mice. PB chimerism was investigated monthly over a period of 4 months. One month post-transplantation chimerism in the blood of CLCA3A1high recipients was comparable to those who received CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs (Fig. 3f). Over time however recipients of CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs showed a gradual decline of donor contribution to the PB (Fig. 3f g) demonstrating a defect in long-term repopulating activity of the CLCA3A1high population. The frequency of CLCA3A1low-derived leukocytes in contrast remained stable compared to the young and age-matched competitor cells (Fig. 3f). In addition CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs produced significantly more myeloid cells in the PB and fewer B and T cells (Fig. 3g). Four months after transplantation spleen and bone marrow (BM) chimerism appeared strongly decreased in recipients receiving CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs (Supplementary Fig. 5b c). Within the donor-derived compartment Clca3a1high- and CLCA3A1low-derived cells generated a similar frequency of myeloid progenitors but the CLCA3A1low samples showed a higher frequency of common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs)‚Äîa typical characteristic of yHSCs3 (Supplementary Fig. 5d). Irrespective of the donor status (CLCA3A1high or CLCA3A1low) CLCA3A1 expression was lost in the BM 4 months after transplantation and the two different cell populations showed similar behavior in secondary transplantations.

Old HSCs induce Taz to keep a minimal regenerative potential

Next we tested whether Taz actively contributes to the functional decline of CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs or whether it gets induced to counteract defects in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs. Intriguingly Clusterin (gene name Clu) was potently induced in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Previous studies showed that Clu expression is YAP1-dependent and is induced in stressed cells to trigger a regenerative response25. To test whether TAZ has a similar function in oHSCs we depleted TAZ in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs using two potent shRNAs (shTAZ#1 and shTAZ#2) shTAZ#2 being more potent than shTAZ#1 and a control shRNA (shRen) targeting Renilla (Fig. 4a). We isolated CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs infected them ex vivo with lentiviral shRNA constructs and transplanted these cells into lethally irradiated recipients. Transplanted CLCA3A1high populations contained ~60‚Äì80% infected (GFP-positive) and ~20‚Äì40% uninfected (GFP-negative) cells in order to use the GFP-negative fraction as a competitor against the GFP-positive fraction from the same donor and follow the frequency of GFP-positive cells within the CD45.2 donor fraction over time (Supplementary Fig. 6b). In the PB shTAZ-transduced donor cells rapidly lost the GFP signal demonstrating that uninfected cells outcompeted TAZ-depleted cells whereas shRen cells maintained a stable frequency of GFP-positive cells (Fig. 4b).

The experiment was independently repeated three times. b PB analysis after transplantation of CLCA3A1high HSCs transduced with the indicated shRNAs.

TAZ-depleted HSCs showed a tendency to produce increased numbers of myeloid cells and decreased numbers of B and T cells (Supplementary Fig. 6c). The effects appeared subtler when compared to those observed for competitive repopulation although both Taz shRNAs showed similar trends. The inferior fitness of shTAZ progeny was also reflected in the BM where TAZ depletion led to a significantly reduced GFPpos fraction in lineage-negative (Linneg) precursor cells (Fig. 4c). The percentage of CD34neg LSK cells in the GFP-positive compartment however remained largely unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 6d) indicating that HSCs were not lost due to Taz depletion. The RNA-Seq analysis of donor-derived LSK CD34neg cells 4 months after transplantation revealed that TAZ-depleted cells were transcriptionally distinct from shRen cells (Fig. 4d e) and that TAZ depletion led to a downregulation of the top 200 genes that were induced in old LT-HSCs (Fig. 4f). These transcriptional profiling analyses in conjunction with our transplantation studies of TAZ-depleted HSCs demonstrate that TAZ sustains a transcriptional program that protects aged HSCs from functional decline.

Clca3a1low HSCs resemble yHSCs at the chromatin level

Given the fundamental changes that occur at the epigenomic level in oHSCs7 we analyzed the chromatin changes in CLCA3A1high and CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs. To this end we profiled the global chromatin accessibility of these cells as well as yHSCs and oHSCs by FAST-ATAC-Seq (Fig. 5a b)26.

Fig. 5: CLCA3A1low HSCs resemble yHSCs on chromatin level. a Heatmaps for FAST-ATAC data of CLCA3A1high CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs oHSCs and yHSCs (n = 3 for CLCA3A1low CLCA3A1high and HSC old; n = 6 for HSC young).

We identified 43031 peaks that were shared between all four samples (Fig. 5b). Strikingly CLCA3A1high HSCs and oHSCs demonstrated many additional peaks of these 22023 were shared between these two samples. The functional GO term analysis of those additional peaks demonstrated a clear enrichment for pathways involved in direct or indirect regulation of TAZ e.g. Hippo and Wnt signaling pathways (Fig. 5c)27. Also the Wwtr1 locus itself showed changes in chromatin accessibility specifically in candidate enhancer regions which are hypomethylated in oHSCs7 (Supplementary Fig. 7). Differential peak analysis of CLCA3A1high vs. CLCA3A1low HSCs corroborated the trend toward more peaks in CLCA3A1high HSCs (Fig. 5d‚Äìf). Increased accessibility also led to greater expression of the associated genes at the mRNA level (Fig. 5e f) which shows that chromatin changes can impact on gene expression.

To identify changes in TF accessibility indicative of altered TF activity which could explain the functional differences we performed a chromVAR analysis28. In accordance with our transcriptomic profiling of CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs and yLT-HSCs CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs clustered together with yLT-HSCs whereas CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs clustered with oLT-HSCs (Fig. 5g h). Furthermore the accessibility of the TEAD motifs was much higher in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs than in yLT-HSCs indicating that TEAD/TAZ is more active in these cells (Fig. 5i).

Collectively our data demonstrate that old CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs have lower TEAD/TAZ activity than CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs and resemble yLT-HSCs at the transcriptional chromatin and functional level.

Low PU.1 expression is associated with aging phenotypes

To understand chromatin accessibility changes in aging HSCs at the single-cell level we performed single-cell ATAC-Seq (scATAC-Seq) of young and old LT HSCs and of CLCA3A1high and CLCA3A1low LT HSCs (Fig. 6a d). Analysis of differentially accessible TF motifs showed a striking correlation when comparing changes in old vs. young and CLCA3A1high vs. CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs (Fig. 6g). Here DNA sequences bound by ETS transcription factors (SPI1 and SPIC) were identified as the most differentially accessible sites in both comparisons as well in our bulk ATAC-Seq data (Fig. 6g and Supplementary Fig. 8a b). While the accessibility of Spi1 motifs progressively decreased from young to old and from CLCA3A1low to CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs the accessibility of a Tead motif showed an opposite behavior when we analyzed the behavior of these motifs in pseudotime analyses (Fig. 6h i). oLT-HSCs are thus a heterogeneous pool of cells where opposed activities of PU.1 and TEAD/TAZ define functionally distinct populations which can be separated based on CLCA3A1. Remarkably Spi1 encodes the transcription factor PU.1 a key regulator of HSC function29 suggesting that the activity of this critical regulator is decreased during HSC aging. Consistently Spi1 expression demonstrated a sharp drop specifically in the HSC-like cluster 1 but not the adjacent cluster 0 in our scRNA-Seq data (Fig. 6j). To investigate whether decreased Spi1 expression in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs also affects PU.1 target gene expression we generated PU.1-dependent gene sets from hematopoietic progenitor cells. For that we depleted PU.1 in the HSC-like cell line BM-HPC#530 using two potent shRNAs and performed RNA-Seq (Fig. 6k l). We identified 667 genes which were downregulated (log2FC < (‚àí1) padj<0.05: shPU1.down) and 899 genes that were upregulated (log2FC > 1 padj < 0.05: shPU1.up) upon PU.1 depletion (Fig. 6l). Consistent with low PU.1 expression in CLCA3A1high HSCs HSC-like cluster 1 contained significantly more cells with high shPU1.up AUC from old vs young a trend which could not be observed in the adjacent cluster 0 (Fig. 6m). Furthermore the shPU1.up gene set was significantly upregulated when comparing CLCA3A1high vs. CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs while the shPU1.down gene set showed opposite regulation (Fig. 6n). We noticed that many genes encoding surface markers commonly used to isolate HSCs (Cd34 Flt3 (CD135) Cd48 Procr (EPCR)) were affected by PU.1 depletion in BM-HPC#5 and were also downregulated in CLCA3A1high vs. CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs (Fig. 6l o). Low Spi1 expression in oHSCs could hence explain the increased frequency of immunophenotypic HSCs commonly observed in aged individuals. We confirmed this by flow cytometry comparing young and old LSK since the frequency of immunophenotypic LT-HSCs in old Clca3a1low LSK resembled that of yLSK cells (Fig. 6p q).

These data demonstrate that HSC aging is associated with a gradual depletion of PU.1 which correlates with specific features of oHSCs at the transcriptional and immunophenotypic level.

Decreased Spi1 expression in yHSC drives features of aging

To test whether decreased PU.1 levels in yHSCs is sufficient to induce an ‚Äúold-like‚Äù HSC phenotype we depleted PU.1 in yHSCs from 14- to 17-week-old by two independent shRNAs. We analyzed the PB and BM only 2 months after transplantation as PU.1-deficient HSCs are lost shortly after transplantation31. PU.1-depleted HSCs rapidly lost their ability to contribute to the production of PB cells but had mostly weaker effects on other parameters in BM and PB (Supplementary Fig. 9a‚Äìd). Due to the critical role of PU.1 in progenitors downstream of the HSC compartment we consequently focused on PU.1‚Äôs role in HSCs. Therefore we performed scRNA-Seq of the LSK compartment from control- (shRen) and PU.1-depleted (shPU1 #1 and shPU1 #2) HSPCs 2 months after transplantation (Fig. 7a‚Äìd Supplementary Fig. 9e). Graph-based clustering revealed seven clusters (Fig. 7a). We used a previously defined stringent HSC vs. MPP1 gene set23 (LT-HSC #2 Fig. 2i) to identify ‚ÄúHSC-like cells‚Äù in our scRNA-Seq data. In this way we identified two populations consisting mainly of HSC-like cells (Fig. 7b). One population located in clusters 2 and 5 contained almost exclusively PU.1-depleted HSC-like cells while shRen HSC-like cells were mainly found in cluster 0 (Fig. 7c d). Just as in BM-HPC#5 cells PU.1 depletion in young HSC-like cells resulted in drastic gene expression changes with Cd34 as well as Flt3 being potently downregulated (Fig. 7e). Consistent with the previously described role of PU.1 in maintaining HSC quiescence genes induced after PU.1 depletion in HSC-like cells showed highly significant enrichment for E2F-dependent target genes (Supplementary Fig. 9f g). Noteworthy Taz mRNA was undetectable in the scRNA-Seq dataset suggesting that PU.1 depletion alone does not lead to Taz induction. The shPU1.up gene set showed high activity exclusively in clusters 2 and 5 which contained shPU1 HSC-like cells (Fig. 7f). Strikingly PU.1 depletion alone was sufficient to induce an ‚Äúaged-like‚Äù transcriptome in young HSC-like cells without inducing a myeloid-biased LT-HSC gene expression program (Fig. 7g h) suggesting that decreased PU.1 expression in oHSCs does not contribute to this phenotype or that it takes longer to establish. However the aHSC gene set showed high activity specifically in PU.1-depleted HSC-like cells with low PU.1 activity‚Äîequivalent to high sh.PU1.up activity (Fig. 7i).

Given the partially overlapping phenotype that depletion of TAZ and PU.1 had on the regenerative potential of HSCs and their opposite activities in our scATAC analyses we hypothesized that Taz is induced during aging to compensate for the decreased PU.1 expression in oHSCs‚Äîpossibly because TAZ can act as a coactivator for PU.1. Consistent with this hypothesis PU.1 and TAZ depletion showed a convergent transcriptional response upon depletion (Fig. 7j). Moreover PU.1 and TAZ physically interacted in GST pulldown assays and TAZ was able to act as a potent PU.1 coactivator in transient luciferase reporter assays in a strictly PU.1-dependent manner (Fig. 7k l). Since we were not able to obtain high-quality genomic binding data for PU.1 or TAZ from freshly sorted HSCs we performed Cut&Run for PU.1 in BM-HPC#5 cells to identify genes that are directly regulated by PU.1. The 3163 PU.1 Cut&Run peaks were highly enriched for ETS-motifs and were almost exclusively located in promoter regions (Fig. 7m‚Äìp). To identify direct PU.1 target genes that are induced in a TAZ-dependent manner we intersected the PU.1 peaks with the genes that are significantly downregulated in transplanted old CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs (Fig. 4e) upon TAZ depletion (Fig. 7q). We identified here 60 genes that were potently downregulated (with a median log2 fold change of ‚àí4.8) upon TAZ depletion (Supplementary Table 1). Here the two gene ontology terms centrosome and microtubule organization which play a critical role in mitosis and symmetric vs. asymmetric cell division were highly enriched in these 60 genes (Fig. 7r). Thus our data show that age-dependent loss of PU.1 activity in HSCs is sufficient to induce aging phenotypes and that Taz can counteract them at least in part by acting as a PU.1 coactivator for specific genes (Fig. 7s t).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNDY3LTAyMi0zMjkyMS130gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Expanding the terpene biosynthetic code with non-canonical 16 carbon atom building blocks,"Chemicals and enzymes

Gene cloning and expression in yeast

All primers used for cloning purposes are listed in the Supplementary Table 2. Yeast codon optimized versions of S. plymuthica sodorifen methyltransferase (SpSodMT) (GenBank WP_004943917.1) A. grandis Œ≥-humulene synthase (AbHumS; GenBank U92267) K. griseola terpentetriene synthase (Cyc2; GenBank AB048795.1) and H. aurantiacus kolavelool synthase (HaKS GenBank ABX04786) were obtained by gene synthesis bearing flanking regions containing specific restriction sites and a generic sequence compatible for USER cloning. Using the generic primes USER-Gen-FP and USER-Gen-RP the above genes were amplified and cloned by USER cloning into a generic backbone introducing BamHI and EcoRI sites at the 5‚Äô end and NotI BglII and XhoI sites at the 3‚Äô end. The constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Subsequently the genes of interest were excised from the generic USER vector by BamHI and XhoI digestion and ligated into pESC vector (Agilent Technologies Cat. #217453) of different selection (TRP for SpSodMT HIS for TPSs) linearized with BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes. This approach enabled subcloning of the genes of interest under P GAL1 promoter and resulted into construction of the following plasmids: pESC-TRP/SpSodMT pESC-HIS/AbHumS pESC-HIS/CYC2 and pESC-HIS/HaKS. Genes encoding the different other TPSs involved in this study (full list available in Supplementary Table 5) were available from previous work as compatible parts for subcloning in pESC-HIS linearized with BamHI and XhoI21313233.

pESC-Leu/CPR2 vector carrying the cDNA encoding a cytochrome P450 reductase from poplar (CPR2)39 was previously modified46 to enable standardized CYPs cloning under the P GAL10 promoter into the EcoRI and NotI restriction sites. Yeast codon optimized versions of CYP71AV1 (GenBank DQ318192) CYP706M1 (GenBank JX518290) and CYP76AK1 (GenBank KR140169) were obtained by gene synthesis carrying flanking regions containing EcoRI and NotI restriction sites. The rest of CYPs (full list available in Supplementary Table 5) were available from previous work144647. All CYPs involved in this study were digested with EcoRI and NotI and subcloned in pESC-Leu/CPR2 linearized with the same restriction enzymes to obtain bifunctional constructs for simultaneous expression of one CYP and CPR2.

For protein expression in E. coli a bacterial codon optimized version of SpSodMT was obtained and cloned into pRSETa (Invitrogen) applying the USER technology described above to generate the corresponding bacterial expression construct pRSETa/SpSodMT. Selective mutations were introduced by USER mutagenesis48.

Strain AM109

In S. cerevisiae heterozygous deletions lead to 50% decrease in the level of the corresponding protein in the majority of yeast genes tested49. Strain AM109 (Mat a/Œ± P GAL1 -HMG2(K6R)::HOx2 ura3 trp1 his3 P TDH3 -HMG2(K6R)x2-::leu2 ERG9/erg9 UBC7/ubc7 SSM4/ssm4 PHO86/pho86) the basis strain used in this study is a diploid strain that contains a heterozygous deletion in the squalene synthase gene ERG9 which is essential for sterol biosynthesis. This deletion helps reduce the drain of FPP substrate and boost the heterologous production of C 16 terpenoids21.

Small-scale C 16 production and quantification in yeast

Selected S. cerevisiae strains were cultivated in 10 mL CM liquid media. Liquid-liquid extraction of 1 mL culture using hexane was applied for measuring the C 16 compounds produced in yeast cells after 48 h of culturing followed by GC-MS and GC-qTOF analysis (see details in the corresponding section below). For quantification 0.01% isopropyl myristate was used as internal standard. Samples were analyzed in triplicates and the error calculated as the mean absolute deviation (MAD) around the mean. Purified C 16 compounds obtained from yeast were used as standards when available to quantify the titer of specific compounds. Titers of compounds 1d and 2d were calculated using the corresponding standards while the average signal peak area of 1d and 2d standards was calculated and used for quantification of the titers of compounds 3d and 4d. Titers of compounds 1b-5b and 7b-10b were calculated using their corresponding standards. Titer of compounds 13OH-1b and 9OH-3b produced by PtAO were calculated based on the purified 13OH-1b and 9OH-3b standards respectively. The average signal of 13OH-1b and 9OH-3b was used for quantification of compounds 11-15. Titers of total C 16 products were calculated using the average of standards corresponding to the most representative products in the profile of each individual mutants.

After 6 h of growth the seed cultures were washed 3 times with water and added to a 5 L bioreactor (Sartorius benchtop bioreactor with BIOSTAT B Plus controller) containing two liter of CM galactose/raffinose media. Fermentation was carried out at 30 ¬∞C with the pH maintained at 4.2 by automatic addition of 4 M NaOH. Airflow was maintained at 1 L/min for the first 24 h increased to 2 L/min from 24 h to 48 h and finally set to 10 L/min after 48 h for the remainder of the fermentation. The dissolved oxygen concentration was controlled at above 20% saturation by agitation cascade between 100-500 rpm. 200 mL of 15√ó concentrated media (30% galactose 15% raffinose 10% YNB 2% dropout mix) was manually fed into the culture at 48 h with subsequent daily feedings of 400 mL 15√ó media.

Yeast growth assay

The engineered yeast strains were grown in glucose-based media until OD 600 ~0.5‚Äì0.7 washed twice with sterile water and resuspended in galactose/raffinose-based media for induction of protein expression. The obtained cultures were diluted to OD 600 ~0.1 (time 0) in a final volume of 25 mL and were incubated at 30 ¬∞C with 150 rpm shaking. Measurements of OD 600 were taken every 2 h to monitor the curve of yeast growth (Supplementary Fig. 3). For OD 600 values higher than 1 samples were diluted accordingly.

Analysis of yeast sterols and squalene

A volume of 4 mL yeast cultures induced to express SpSodMT (or containing the empty pESC-TRP vector) was used to collect yeast cells. The obtained pellet was treated with butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) in a ratio of 2:1 (v/w) resuspended in 500 ¬µL 10% KOH in 80% EtOH solution and incubated at 70 ¬∞C for 2 h. Samples were cooled at room temperature and overlaid with 300 ¬µL of hexane followed by vigorous vortexing prior to collecting the hexane phase. The extraction was repeated three times and the collected hexane phase (~0.9 mL) was initially washed with water (equal volume) three times and then evaporated down to 100 ¬µL and derivatized with 50 ¬µL trimethylsilyl cyanide (Sigma Cat. #212849) for 30 min at 60 ¬∞C prior to GC-MS analysis46.

GC analysis conditions

GC-MS analysis method 1 was performed on a Shimadzu GC-2010 system equipped with a GCMS-QP2010 Plus mass spectrometer and was carried on a HP-5ms UI column (30 m x 0.25 mm ID x 0.25 ¬µm film thickness) using helium as a carrier gas with a linear velocity of 30 cm/sec and the following temperature program: initial temperature 60 ¬∞C ramp to 300 ¬∞C at a rate of 10 ¬∞C/min hold for 3.5 min. This method was used for analysis of samples resulting from: incubation of the SPME fiber for 30 min over the head-space of 2-10 mL yeast cultures 2 ŒºL of the hexane phase overlaying the E. coli enzyme sourced purified in vitro enzymatic reactions and 1 ¬µL injections of hexane from the hexane extractions of non-saponifiable lipid and acid hydrolyzed in vitro enzymatic reactions using S. cerevisiae expressed SpSodMT wild-type and mutants.

GC-MS analysis method 2 was performed on a Shimadzu Nexis GC-2030 system equipped with a GCMS-QP2020 NX mass spectrometer and an HP-5ms column (30 m x 0.25 mm ID x 0.25 ¬µm film thickness). He carrier gas was helium with a linear velocity of 30 cm/sec and the following temperature program was used: initial temperature 60 ¬∞C ramp to 170 ¬∞C at 10 ¬∞C/min ramp to 210 at 2 ¬∞C/min ramp to 300 ¬∞C at 20 ¬∞C/min hold for 5 min. This method was used for analysis of samples resulting from hexane extractions of S. cerevisiae grown in buffered media expressing SpSodMT together with Cyc2 or HaKS and SPME fiber sampling of the head-space of in vitro enzymatic reactions using S. cerevisiae expressed SpSodMT together with Cyc2 or HaKS.

GC-APCI-QqToF experiments were performed on a Scion 456 GC system (Bruker Daltonics) with a micrOTOF-Q II (QqToF) mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) using an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source (APCI). Samples (1 ¬µL) were injected at 250 ¬∞C in splitless mode using a BR-5ms capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm ID x 0.25 ¬µm film thickness; Bruker Daltonics). The carrier gas was helium with a constant flow of 1.0 mL min‚àí1. The temperature program was: 50 ¬∞C for 1 min ramp to 280 ¬∞C at 15 ¬∞C min‚àí1 and hold for 3.67 min. The transfer line was maintained at 280 ¬∞C and the temperature of the APCI source was 280 ¬∞C and of the APCI heater 200 ¬∞C. The charging voltage was 2000 V. The mass spectrometer was operated in full scan positive ion mode with the following settings: m/z 80 ‚àí 310: nebulizer gas (nitrogen) 3.5 bar; drying gas (nitrogen) 2.5 L min‚àí1; drying gas temperature 240 ¬∞C; capillary voltage 3000 V; spectra acquisition rate 5 Hz. Calibration for accurate mass was performed at the beginning of each chromatographic run using perfluorotributylamine vapour (PFTBA; Sigma Aldrich). Data acquisition was performed using Compass CDS (Version 3.0.1; Bruker Daltonics) Compass oTOF Control (Version 3.4 Bruker Daltonics) and Hystar (Version 3.2 SR4 Bruker Daltonics). Data analysis was performed using Compass DataAnalysis software (Version 4.3 Bruker Daltonics).

GC-MS-olfactometry

Samples containing 100‚Äì300 Œºg of each of the isolated compounds were directly injected on Tenax-TA traps (200 mg of Tenax-TA mesh size 60/80 Markes International Llantrisant UK). The trapped volatiles were thermally desorbed (TurboMatrix 300 Perkin Elmer Shelton USA) using a two-step procedure: Primary desorption was at 250 ¬∞C with a 50 mL min‚àí1 flow of carrier gas for 15.0 min. The stripped volatiles were trapped in a Tenax-TA cold trap (30 mg held at 5 ¬∞C) which was subsequently heated at 300 ¬∞C for 4 min (secondary desorption outlet split 1:10). This allowed for rapid transfer of volatiles to a GC-MS (6890 N GC interfaced with a 5973 MSD from Agilent Technologies Palo Alto California) through a heated (225 ¬∞C) transfer line. Separation of volatiles was carried out on a ZB-Wax capillary column 30 m long x 0.25 mm internal diameter 0.50 ¬µm film thickness. The column pressure was held constant at 2.3 psi resulting in an initial flow rate of 1.4 mL min‚àí1 using hydrogen as carrier gas. The column temperature program was: 10 min at 30 ¬∞C from 30 ¬∞C to 240 ¬∞C at 8 ¬∞C min‚àí1 and finally 5 min at 240 ¬∞C. The effluent of the column was split in a ratio of 1:2:2 between the mass spectrometer (electron ionisation mode at 70 eV scanning m/z ratios between 15 and 300) and two olfactory detector ports (ODP-2 Gerstel M√ºlheim an der Ruhr). Agilent Chemstation (E.02.02.1431) was used for data acquisition and data analysis.

Construction of the SpSodMT structural model

The structural model of SpSodMT was constructed using the SWISS-MODEL server51 and 5kok29 as template scoring a GMQE of 0.52 and a QMEAN of ‚àí2.70 and covering amino acids 31-325. S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) was imported into the model from 5kok and FPP was chosen as a ligand from the ZINC database (ID: ZINC12494625). Using the SwissDock program FPP was not found to dock next to SAH in the expected pocket. VegaZZ AMMP edition was used to optimize SpSodMT model by selecting the Conjugate Gradient (CG) algorithm for energy optimization and the CHARMM force field for fast docking. A total of 645 steps were run. The docking results using the optimized SpSodMT model demonstrated that FPP was placed next to SAH as expected. To obtain a more accurate model the optimization process was repeated following conversion of SAH into S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). The final model displayed a deeper cavity for FPP than the initial model and 4 √Ö distance from SAM to FPP as expected for a methyl transfer5253. Subsequently a refined SpSodMT model was obtained using Molecular mechanics (MM2) algorithm54. The energy optimization was performed with the software Chem3D (v. 16.0) from CSC Cambridge (USA). Residues F56 Q57 F58 G187 I189 S190 N219 V273 W276 L302 and W306 were identified within 5 √Ö of the isoprene unit tail and were selected as potential mutagenesis targets for modifying product specificity.

Water depths in the HMB range from 20 m in the north to 110 m in the south. This study used marine sediment from the deep-drilled cores HMB-103 (34¬∞43.50'N 125¬∞37.51'E; water depth of 48 m) and HMB-102 (34¬∞7.96‚ÄôN 125¬∞40.94‚ÄôE water depth: 57 m). The HMB is characterised by high sedimentation rates (approximately 0.2 cm/yr) allowing for the reconstruction of the SST record at a high resolution. To investigate changes of monthly mean SST at the study area in situ SST data from Chilbaldo buoy station (dataset from the Korea Meteorological Administration KMA) for the period 1998‚Äì2018 was examined (Fig. 1b)24. The lowest SST (5.4 ¬∞C) occurs in February whereas the highest (22.4 ¬∞C) occurs in August. The annual mean SST is 13.7 ¬∞C.

SST at the study area is strongly influenced by the seasonality of two atmospheric circulation systems: the mid-latitude Westerly Jet (WJ) and the East Asian monsoon. During winter the main route of the WJ lies in the south of the Himalayas (< 30¬∞N)2526 and the dry and cold terrestrial air mass anchored in Siberia expands southward27. Conversely during summer the WJ moves to the north of the Tibetan Plateau (> 42¬∞N). The wet and warm subtropical air mass from the Northwest Pacific overarches the East Asian marginal sea areas. Change in atmospheric heat flux associated with seasonality of the two-circulation system is the primary cause of SST variations in this shallow area28. The extended winter regime with both dry and cold air and stronger wind speed accompanied by the southward shift of the WJ can maintain the vertical contrast between the local ocean and the atmosphere and cause excessive heat loss to the atmosphere thereby decreased the SST272930. In the meantime the persisting summer regime associated with the northward migration of Westerly Jet would reduce the heat loss to the atmosphere thereby increases the SST.

Radiocarbon dating of ten samples from cores HMB-102 (six samples) and -103 (four samples) has been previously measured using benthic foraminifera and bivalve shell in Holocene muddy sediments31. The age-depth model for each core was constructed using the Bacon 2.5 package in R32 with the Marine20 radiocarbon calibration curve and the ŒîR value of 284 ¬± 39 years (Fig. 2). The Bacon method simulates the accumulation rates of core sediments based on Bayesian statistics and calculates the ages and uncertainties (1œÉ) of sediment deposits. Core HMB-103 covers the last 6.5 cal kyr B.P.; while core HMB-102 covers the period between 6.9 and 10 cal kyr B.P.. The results of the 210Pb dating of the HMB-103 and other core-top sediments collected near the HMB-103 were examined. The 210Pb and 226Ra activities were measured at the Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI). The observed excess 210Pb activities in the box cores indicate that the core-top surface sediments near the HMB-103 are modern-day sediments which is in line with previous findings33. However the 210Pb dating of HMB-103 indicates that the upper most sediment appears to be at least 111 years older than the sampling year of 2013 (see ‚ÄúMethod‚Äù). According to the age model the core HMB-103 and -102 have a high sedimentation rate (approximately 0.2 cm/yr) which allows for the SST reconstruction at a high resolution (approximately 10‚Äì20 years) for the Holocene.

A new high-resolution alkenone SST composite covering the Holocene was constructed by combining records from cores HMB-103 and -102. For the SST reconstruction of HMB-103 newly analysed alkenone data (269 samples) were added to the previously published temperature data (80 samples)24 hence a total of 349 samples were used in this study. For the HMB-102 188 new samples were added to the previous 41 samples24. Since we collected sediment samples at 3 cm interval there could be bioturbation effects. In this case the temperature signal would be smoothed and/or reduced by mixing of the sediments. The error range of the alkenone temperature assessment for replicate samples of the two kinds of homogeneous laboratory-standard marine sediments exhibited less than ¬± 0.05 ¬∞C (n = 90) and ¬± 0.07 ¬∞C (n = 7) at 95% confidence level respectively. The alkenone SST estimates obtained from the 31 core-top sediments collected near HMB-103 were compared with in situ temperatures24. The results indicated that the alkenone unsaturation index effectively represented the averaged SST from April to October in this area (Fig. 1b).

Figure 3ab shows the resulting high-resolution SST record reconstructed from alkenone analysis of the HMB-102 and -103 cores. The 10-year interpolated alkenone SSTs are listed in Supplementary Table S1. The essential observed characteristic was the periodic SST fluctuations on a multidecadal- to millennial-scale. Although the amplitude of variations often range within ¬± 1 ¬∞C (Fig. 3a) these periodic fluctuations were distinct considering the error range of SST reconstructions from homogeneous marine sediment (< ¬± 0.1 ¬∞C). SSTs were relatively warm during the early Holocene (8‚Äì10 cal kyr B.P.) then cooled during the period of 6.5‚Äì8 cal kyr B.P. then warm again between 5 and 6.5 cal kyr B.P. (Fig. 3a). There were several distinct and rapid cooling events with a large amplitude up to 3 ¬∞C during the period of 7‚Äì9 cal kyr B.P. (Fig. 3a). In a previous study on the reconstruction of low-resolution (~ 50 years) alkenone SSTs from cores HMB-102 and -103 Bae et al.24 demonstrated that the cold period dropped by 2 ¬∞C for the period of 3‚Äì5 cal kyr B.P. was a regional pattern in the mid-latitudes of East Asia via comparison with other regional temperature records. Two cooling periods (3‚Äì5 cal kyr B.P. and ~ 7‚Äì8 cal kyr B.P.) were possibly associated with millennial variations. To remove the cooling patterns on a millennial scale and investigate centennial variations we extracted 50‚Äì2000 years periodicities from the raw dataset by applying a band-pass filter (Fig. 3b). The spectral analysis of band-pass filtered SSTs revealed significant (> 90% confidence level) periodicities of 544 414 190 135 102 and 89 years (Fig. 4a). In addition 1034-year cycle variability seems to exist (Fig. 4a). We also conducted wavelet analysis on the Holocene alkenone SSTs (Fig. 5a). The cycles of 544 414 190 135 102 89 and 78 years were significant for the interval of 7‚Äì9 cal kyr B.P. (Fig. 5a). Another characteristic of the wavelet analysis results is that 1034-year cycles predominated during the early to mid- Holocene (Fig. 5a). The periodic centennial-scale fluctuations of alkenone SSTs with the periodicities of 190 135 102 and 89 years have been strengthened after 2 cal kyr B.P. (Fig. 5a). Overall the composite SST record indicated the occurrence of centennial-scale variability over the last 10000 years.

We used the Holocene total solar irradiance (TSI) data obtained by Steinhilber et al.19 (Fig. 3c) for comparison with our composite SST record. TSI data have been reconstructed based on the principal component analysis of production rates of 14C in tree ring and 10Be obtained from ice cores collected in Greenland and Antarctica. Variations in TSI during the Holocene exhibit periodic fluctuations on multidecadal to millennial scales although the magnitudes were less than 1 W/m2 (Fig. 3c). The spectral analysis on band-pass filtered (50‚Äì2000 years) TSI data revealed that the periodicities of 353 206 150 130 104 and 87 years were significant (> 90% confidence level) (Fig. 4a). The wavelet analysis of the TSI data demonstrated that the periodic centennial-scale fluctuations of solar activity have been strengthened for the periods of 0‚Äì3 4.5‚Äì6 and 7‚Äì9 cal kyr B.P. (Fig. 5b).

The composite SST record was compared to the variations in solar activity over the Holocene (Fig. 3) showing a good agreement at the centennial scale. Periods of low SST corresponded approximately to those of low TSI within the estimated age error (¬± 60‚Äì90 years). In particular the periods of minimum solar activity known as Dalton (~ 1820 CE) Maunder (~ 1680 CE) and Sp√∂rer (~ 1470 CE) which have been previously recognised from sunspot observation data covering the last 500 years correspond to cold intervals in our SST composite. We compared the cross spectrum analysis results obtained from these two datasets (Fig. 4b). Cycles of 89 and 102 years in the SST record could have been associated with those of 87 and 104 years in the TSI record (i.e. Gleissberg cycles). Additionally the 190-year cycles observed in HMB-103 were similar to the 206-year TSI cycles (i.e. Suess/de Vries cycles). Finally the 414-year cycle may reflect 353-year TSI cycles (unnamed cycles). The results of the coherence calculation between the SSTs and the TSI confirm the correspondence of the periodicities between them (Fig. 4b). The periodicities of 88 102 130 247 and 927 years are highly coherent between SST and TSI (> 99% Monte Carlo false alarm level) (Fig. 4b). The simultaneous occurrence of cold SSTs and low TSI combined with their similar cyclicity indicates that the solar activity may have influenced the centennial-scale SST variability in the study area.",,,,,,

Do Not Let Your Children Play With Old Plastic Toys

Playing with old plastic toys may not be good for your child's health. Toxins found in old toys and dress-up items made of plastic.

Reuse and recycling of old products helps prevent environmental degradation and can significantly reduce air and water pollution. But not all products may not be good to reuse again particularly old plastic toys. Researchers at the University of Gothenburg Sweden have warned that old toys and dress-up items may contain toxic chemicals that can cause cancer disrupt growth and development in children and reduce their future reproductive capacities.

The researchers found hazardous chemicals such as phthalates and short chain chlorinated paraffins in about 84 per cent of old plastic toys and dress-up items that they tested. These chemicals are used as plasticizers and flame retardants in toys. They reported their findings in an article recently published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials Advances.

In many toys and items that they tested (both old and new) the chemical content was found exceeding the current legal limits. But the number was significantly higher in older toys and items (84 per cent) compared to the newer toys and items (30 per cent).

Further they found significantly higher concentrations of toxic chemicals in the older items. The concentrations of phthalates in many old balls constituted over 40 per cent of the toy's weight which is 400 times over the legal limit according to the researchers.

Need to regulate use of toxic chemicals in toys

Many countries regulate the chemical content in toys to protect the health and safety of children.

For example the EU's Toy Safety Directive have set the permissible limit for phthalates used in new toys at 0.1 per cent by weight while for short chain chlorinated paraffins it is 0.15 per cent by weight.

However this legislation is only applicable to new toys not old ones noted Daniel Slunge Environmental Economist at the University of Gothenburg.

In 2019 the Quality Council of India (QCI) conducted a testing survey of imported toys available in the markets of Delhi and NCR. About 67 per cent of the imported toys failed to meet the safety standards which included the admissible levels of chemicals such as phthalate heavy metals and physical safety properties.

Phthalates are identified as endocrine disruptors (EDs) that can cause hormonal imbalances. Exposure to phthalates has been linked to a range of health problems including asthma preterm birth attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and breast cancer.

Sadly while Indian authorities have made it mandatory for imported toys to meet the safety standards it remains voluntary for domestic toy makers in the country.

As parents you can protect your children from these chemicals at some levels by choosing safe toys for them and paying attention to the items they come in contact with.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Jonathan Trudel says he didn't think there would be any problem when he booked a weekend stay for his mother's birthday at a cabin in Belair Provincial Forest back in January.

Jonathan's mother Carmen Trudel is visually impaired and has been using a service dog for more than 20 years. Jonathan said it didn't even occur to him to mention the dog at the time even though the cabin did have a no pet policy.

As the weekend in August drew near Jonathan thought he should let the host know they would have a service dog with them. ""I just emailed the host saying 'my mom and my sister will be checking in first.' Out of courtesy I just figured I'll let them know that there will be a guide dog coming.""

Ten minutes later Jonathan got a call from an Airbnb case manager saying they had to cancel the reservation because of the host's no pet policy.

""I talked to her on the app I said 'you know this is actually illegal'"" said Jonathan.

Manitoba's Human Rights Code prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities who rely on a service animal wheelchair or any other remedial appliance or device.

Jonathan then began messaging back and forth with the host who asked for proof that the dog was trained as a service animal.

""Even in Airbnb's policy it said we don't have to do that"" said Jonathan.

But he sent the proof anyway and after some more messaging the host reluctantly agreed to let them stay at the cabin.

""He said 'I know I'm going to lose no matter what go enjoy my cabin'"" said Jonathan.

But Jonathan says they couldn't enjoy it because they were too worried about dog hair getting everywhere. The host had said the reason for the no pet policy was his mother's severe allergies.

""We were worried about any little bit of hair being on the ground"" said Jonathan ""We did everything we could we swept we picked up his droppings.""

Carmen Trudel (left) says having a service animal has never been an issue for her. (Source; CTV news Winnipeg) Carmen says this has never been an issue for her before.

""I have brought him everywhere he's been to Disney World and he's allowed everywhere"" she said.

Airbnb says the host was not in compliance with their policy.

""Airbnb does not tolerate differential treatment for Service Animals and we have a specially trained team to investigate claims of discrimination with actions ranging from warnings to suspensions to full removal depending on the circumstances.

East Japan Railway Company (JR East) has launched the Steam store page for JR EAST Train Simulator. The game is expected to be released in early access on September 20 (JST).



JR EAST Train Simulator is a train driving simulation game that is being published by Japanese train company JR East and developed by Ongakukan a company that creates professional simulators for business use. Players will be able to experience what it is like to drive trains on the real-life JR East lines. The game will first be available in early access and will include the following route segments:

‚Äì Hachiko Line (Kiha 110 Series) Upbound Takasaki ‚Äì Kuragano (approx. 4 min. 4.4km)

‚Äì Keihin Tohoku Line (Series E233-1000) Southbound between Omiya and Yono (about 5 min. 2.7km)

When playing the game you first choose a line and train model before selecting which station along the route that you would like to begin from. There are three difficulty modes in the game and the Beginner difficulty displays an operation guide driving instructions and other helpful information that will make the game easier to enjoy for those who have never played a train driving sim before.





The game is being developed based on the professional simulator that is actually used by JR East drivers for training purposes. The visual scenery that is shown while driving is high-definition live action footage recorded on the JR East lines and the sounds heard from the trains running on the tracks use audio that was recorded using real-life trains. The instrument panel is a faithful replica that responds just like the real thing and there are a number of other meticulous details.

In April of this year four hotels in Japan were offering accommodation packages that included the ability to experience JR EAST Train Simulators that were set up within the hotels. It is unclear what connection these simulators have to the new game but both are developed by the same company: Ongakukan.

The game is expected to stay in early access for 2-3 months and while it will initially only include two routes as mentioned above in the full release ‚Äúyou will be able to change the routes you can drive and purchase DLC to drive longer distance sections.‚Äù The full release of the game is also expected to include support for external controllers.





The Steam page for JR EAST Train Simulator can be found here.

High number of customer complaints

Originally founded by Sears Roebuck and Co. in 1937 Allstate services nearly 16 million customers across the US making it one of the largest insurers in the country. The auto insurance giant currently ranks fourth in the country in terms of total market share according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The carrier doesn‚Äôt just handle car insurance though It also provides motorcycle boat and pet insurance. Allstate can be found in all 50 states plus Washington DC.

Allstate provides a long list of auto coverage options as well as a hearty collection of possible discounts but according to Bankrate Allstate‚Äôs premiums are higher than most other insurance carriers that CNET has reviewed. It also ranks below average in customer satisfaction and received a low rating from repair professionals.

Answer a few questions to see personalized rates from top carriers.

Pros of using Allstate

Allstate is available in every US state and Washington DC. Along with insuring your automobile you can also insure your house rental condo or even your phone while receiving a discount for bundling policies.

The insurance carrier provides a wide range of insurance add-ons that can protect your car‚Äôs sound system reimburse rental cars and provide free roadside assistance. It also doles out bonuses every six months to drivers enrolled in its Safe Driving Club.

Allstate offers a long list of additional discounts including paperless automatic payment multiple insurance policies good student and new car discounts. And all members can use roadside assistance (for a fee) whether or not it‚Äôs part of their policy.

Cons of using Allstate

Allstate‚Äôs high premiums are its most obvious downside. It‚Äôs hard to beat low cost and Allstate doesn‚Äôt have that right now.

The insurance provider also receives relatively low ratings for customer satisfaction and claims satisfaction per the 2021 J.D. Power US Auto Insurance Study. Allstate also has more than twice the level of complaints than the industry average per the National Association of Insurance Commissioners‚Äô complaint index.

Almost all of the extra protections and benefits at Allstate -- such as new car replacement or accidental forgiveness -- come with additional costs. The insurance giant has many discounts but not many extra services for free.

Allstate insurance cost

Allstate currently offers some of the highest premiums out of the auto insurance providers that CNET‚Äôs reviewed. With an annual average full coverage rate of $2438 for drivers with clean histories Allstate‚Äôs rate is more than double that of some competitors and hundreds more than the national average according to research conducted by Bankrate.

Minimum coverage per year at Allstate costs $558 a bit higher than the industry baseline of $545. A healthy list of discounts can bring down those costs but Allstate‚Äôs base rates are consistently higher than competitors‚Äô right now.

Allstate Premium Prices

CNET reviews insurance carriers and products by exhaustively comparing them across set criteria. For auto insurance we examine average annual premium rates for full coverage consumer complaints collision repair scores the carrier‚Äôs financial strength auto claims satisfaction and overall customer satisfaction. Our data comes from a multitude of sources.

Florida State earned a hard-fought 24-23 victory over LSU in the Allstate Louisiana Kickoff at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans La. Shyheim Brown blocked an extra-point attempt by LSU after the Tigers scored on the final play of regulation to preserve a victory for the Seminoles who improve to 2-0 on the early season. LSU is 0-1 after their first game under head coach Brian Kelly.

FSU was playing LSU in their own backyard in front of a split crowd of 68388 Seminoles and Tigers fans and before a national television audience.

The first half saw squandered opportunities for both teams. FSU led 7-3 after 30 minutes.

LSU struck first on a 36-yard field goal by Damian Ramos after their opening drive which was aided by Ryan Fitzgerald‚Äôs kickoff sailing out of bounds and a penalty on Renardo Green.

FSU answered and took the lead 7-3 on a trick play where FSU showed double reverse but a flea flicker got the ball back to quarterback Jordan Travis who then threw a 39-yard pass to Ontaria Wilson for the score. That touchdown came with 13 minutes remaining in the first half.

Neither team posted any other points in the opening half as Ryan Fitzgerald missed a 47-yard field goal attempt for the Seminoles and a 30-yard field goal attempt by Ramos for the Tigers was blocked by FSU defensive end Jared Verse. FSU also had a short field late in the half when LSU punt returner Malik Nabers muffed a punt by Alex Mastromanno at the LSU 16-yard line and Wyatt Rector recovered. FSU went for it on fourth down a few plays later and the pass fell incomplete leading to a turnover on downs.

FSU opened the second half with a 14-play drive that went 68 yards and culminated in a 25-yard field goal by Fitzgerald. FSU led 10-3 with 8:29 remaining in the third quarter.

The Seminoles then padded their lead pushing it to 17-3 when Travis again connected with O. Wilson for a touchdown. This was a 27-yard strike that capped an 8-play 57-yard drive that took 2:46 off the clock. FSU led 17-3 with 4:17 remaining in the third quarter.

LSU closed the gap to 17-10 in the final seconds of the third quarter when running back Noah Cain plunged in from less than a yard out to cap an 11-play 82-yard drive.

FSU would answer with a 12-play drive that went 79 yards and took 5:56 off the clock. It was capped with 9:04 remaining in the game when DJ Lundy playing fullback took a handoff from Travis and plunged in from a yard out. FSU led 24-10 after the extra-point sailed through the uprights.

The Tigers wouldn't go away though. They closed the gap to to 24-17 with 4:07 remaining when Jayden Daniels connected with Jaray Jenkins for a 22-yard touchdown pass to cap off a 15-play 75-yard drive.

FSU would go 3-and-out after the LSU score and it immediately looked like the Tigers would have a chance to make things interesting in the final two minutes but for the second time on the evening LSU punt returner Malik Nabers muffed a punt. This time FSU linebacker Brendan Gant recovered it at the 8 yard line.

FSU would move the ball down to the 1-yard line but fumble it away to LSU on an attempted pitch by Travis to running back Treshaun Ward that hit the turf.

With a last chance LSU had 80 seconds and 99 yards to go to try and tie with a touchdown or go for the lead and a potential victory if they opted for a two-point conversion after a touchdown.

In a game with a lot of twists and turns the final minute-plus provided plenty.

The Tigers got to midfield with just under 30 seconds remaining and one timeout but a timely sack by FSU defensive end Jared Verse forced the Tigers to use their final timeout of the second half. With the clock seemingly against them the Tigers charged on and would score as the clock hit triple-zero as Daniels again connected with Jenkins from two yards out. The touchdown pass came after an extensive replay session that reviewed a 17-yard connection by Daniels to tight end Mason Taylor where he was ruled down at the 2-yard line with one second remaining but somehow the clock did not expire and the Tigers were able to run a final play which resulted in the score to close the gap to 24-23 with the extra-point set to be kicked.

On the extra-point attempt Brown would deflect it and give FSU the victory as the ball hit the post.

The Seminoles flooded to the field. The warchant rang out from the stands. FSU is 2-0 on 2022.

FSU has a bye next weekend and returns to action on Friday Sept. 16th at 7:30 p.m. when they travel to face Louisville (0-1).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiuAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50b21haGF3a25hdGlvbi5jb20vZmxvcmlkYS1zdGF0ZS1mb290YmFsbC1mc3Utc2VtaW5vbGVzLzIwMjIvOS80LzIzMzM3MjI0L2NmYi1hY2Mtc2VjLWRlZmVhdHMtbHN1LXNjb3JlLWluLWFsbHN0YXRlLWxvdWlzaWFuYS1raWNrb2ZmLWpvcmRhbi10cmF2aXMtbWlrZS1ub3J2ZWxsLW5ldy1vcmxlYW5z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Quick hitter: Florida State Seminoles beat LSU 24-10,"The Florida State Seminoles improve to 2-0 on the season with a 24-23 win over the LSU Tigers surviving a late scare thanks to a blocked extra point in the Allstate Louisiana Kickoff game Sunday night.

Florida State fell behind quickly after two penalties and a long run handed LSU a 3-0 head start. From there the Noles rattled off 17 straight points largely on the shoulders of Jordan Travis. FSU‚Äôs two big offensive plays both came from the combo Jordan Travis and Ontaria Wilson.

The first saw Wilson getting wide open following a reverse flea flicker for a 39-yard touchdown to take the 7-3 lead.

The second came late in the 3rd quarter as Wilson fought through defensive pass interference to make a one-handed grab for the score.

Both throws were part of an impressive night for Travis as he flashed with both his arm and his legs.

The defense largely held LSU‚Äôs offense in check outside of one penalty-aided drive that allowed LSU to move within 7 to start the 4th quarter. The biggest killer was LSU QB Jayden Daniels scrambling but the Noles held the rest of the Tigers in check.

The victory gives Florida State its first 2-0 start since 2016.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWFkdm9jYXRlLmNvbS9uby1sc3Vmc3UtMDkwNTIyLTAyOC1qcGcvaW1hZ2VfNTkwZDViMWEtMDAzZi01NzQxLTk1ZTAtMzZiYjM1ZDRmNDY2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,no.lsufsu.090522.028.jpg | | theadvocate.com,"You have permission to edit this image.

In August Amazon announced its all-cash deal of $61 per share to acquire iRobot.

According to industry data iRobot's Roomba dominates the smart vacuum market with a 75% market share by revenue in the U.S.

The FTC's antitrust review includes a look at both head-to-head competition and whether the deal would illegally boost Amazon's market share in the connected device and retail markets.

Earlier in August Bloomberg quoted an Amazon spokesperson saying that the company would continue to supply retailers with iRobot products and sell competing devices on Amazon's retail websites.

All 7.8 billion people on the planet make this world diverse. Languages cultures beliefs race and other characteristics differentiate people. Despite all the differences several ethnic groups live together in different countries. In a relatively short period Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries have seen major societal shifts. In 2016 59 percent of people aged 55 to 64 were employed. The number reduced to 48 percent in 2000. Almost one out of every ten persons in the OECD countries is foreign-born and more than a quarter of those in the younger cohorts (15 to 34 years old) are foreign-born or native-born kids of immigrants. One of the main reasons behind this is companies like Meta Platforms Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) and Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ: GOOGL) that are promoting diversity in workspaces by roping in the skilled workforce from all across the globe.

According to the 18th Annual Global Survey conducted by PwC 85 percent of CEOs stated that having a diverse and inclusive workforce boosted their bottom line. Delivering through diversity McKinsey‚Äôs latest workplace diversity study reinforces the global applicability of the link between diversity ‚Äì defined as a higher proportion of women and a more diverse ethnic and cultural composition in large corporate leadership ‚Äì and financial performance. According to McKinsey‚Äôs research a country‚Äôs financial performance can be improved by having a diversified workforce. Schools and classrooms with a varied student body provide social cognitive and emotional benefits. Furthermore living in a diverse community can have a good impact on an individual‚Äôs identity and interactions with others.

Countries like Norway United States New Zealand Australia Belgium the Netherlands Thailand etc. are all considered among the most diverse countries in the world. Big companies such as Facebook Inc. Common Stock (NASDAQ: FB) Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) and Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are all focusing on a more enabling environment for people of all races and ethnicities which bodes well not just for the companies but for the world as a whole.

Though a fair comparison is nearly impossible to draw here based on self-reported metrics on Amazon‚Äôs part and a combo of Nielsen and proprietary streaming data on HBO and HBO Max‚Äôs side the TV industry at large is bound to compare the ‚ÄúRings of Power‚Äù premiere with the U.S. launch of HBO‚Äôs ‚ÄúHouse of the Dragon‚Äù which premiered to a record-breaking nearly 10 million viewers Aug. 21 and grew its viewership by 2% with its second episode Aug. 28 (global figures were not disclosed). The ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù prequel has been pitted against the ‚ÄúLord of the Rings‚Äù series since well before either debuted within two weeks of each other.

‚ÄúIt is somehow fitting that Tolkien‚Äôs stories ‚Äì among the most popular of all time and what many consider to be the true origin of the fantasy genre ‚Äì have led us to this proud moment‚Äù Jennifer Salke head of Amazon Studios said in a statement provided by Amazon along with the ‚ÄúRings of Power‚Äù viewership numbers. ‚ÄúI am so grateful to the Tolkien Estate ‚Äì and to our showrunners J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay executive producer Lindsey Weber cast and crew ‚Äì for their tireless collaborative efforts and boundless creative energy. And it is the tens of millions of fans watching ‚Äì clearly as passionate about Middle-earth as we are ‚Äì who are our true measure of success.‚Äù

Costing a reported $465 million for its first season alone with a second season already in the works at Amazon the adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien‚Äôs work follows 23 series regulars during the lesser-known story of the Second Age of Tolkien‚Äôs Middle-earth.

Though ‚ÄúThe Rings of Power‚Äù premiere has received much attention it hasn‚Äôt all been positive. Amazon‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Lord of the Rings‚Äù series appears to have been review bombed ‚Äî a practice involving bad-faith users flooding intentionally negative reviews for a show or film ‚Äî on sites like Rotten Tomatoes where it has an 84% rating from professional critics but a 35% from user-submitted reviews. (‚ÄúThe Rings of Power‚Äù has specifically faced backlash from some people who take issue with the decision to cast actors of color as elves dwarves harfoots and other folk of Tolkien‚Äôs fictional Middle-earth.)

As Variety reported Friday Prime Video user reviews of ‚ÄúThe Rings of Power‚Äù are being held by Amazon for the first 72 hours post launch a delay implemented across the board for all Prime Video series earlier this summer that began around the time of the launch of ‚ÄúA League of Their Own.‚Äù The new procedure involves a hold that allows for reviews to be evaluated to determine whether they were created by a bot or troll.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzkvNC8yMzMzNjYyNC9hbWF6b24tcHJpbWUtdmlkZW8tdGhyZWUtZGF5LXBhdXNlLXJpbmdzLW9mLXBvd2VyLXJldmlldy1ib21iaW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon's putting a three-day pause on reviews for The Rings of Power,"Amazon is reportedly putting a three-day delay on user reviews for all of its content on Prime Video including the newly-released The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. According to reports from Variety and Deadline the delay is supposed to help stave off review bombing or the act of flooding a particular show movie game or book with negative remarks.

An Amazon representative told Variety that it put the policy in place to give the service time to evaluate whether a user review comes from an actual viewer ‚Äî not a bot or troll looking to hijack the reviews section. Amazon introduced the policy earlier this summer starting with its reboot of A League of Their Own which contended with review bombers who opposed the show‚Äôs political stance.

The Rings of Power is unfortunately dealing with a similar influx of negative reviews with some users targeting its inclusion of actors from underrepresented backgrounds. The series offers a different take on J.R.R. Tolkien‚Äôs The Lord of the Rings universe and is set during Middle-earth‚Äôs Second Age. Amazon says the series raked in 25 million global viewers the day it premiered making it the biggest debut for Amazon Prime Video to date.

But despite Amazon‚Äôs efforts to hold back a wave of bad reviews on its platform this still doesn‚Äôt stop The Rings of Power from getting review bombed on other websites like Rotten Tomatoes and the Amazon-owned IMDb. The series currently has a general audience rating of 34 percent on Rotten Tomatoes while 24.7 percent of reviewers on IMDb gave it one star.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDEwcGhvZW5peC5jb20vbmV3cy9hbWF6b24tdG8tY2xvc2Utc2NyYXAtcGxhbnMtZm9yLWRvemVucy1vZi13YXJlaG91c2VzLWFtaWQtc2xvd2luZy1zYWxlcy1ncm93dGgtcmVwb3J00gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94MTBwaG9lbml4LmNvbS9uZXdzL2FtYXpvbi10by1jbG9zZS1zY3JhcC1wbGFucy1mb3ItZG96ZW5zLW9mLXdhcmVob3VzZXMtYW1pZC1zbG93aW5nLXNhbGVzLWdyb3d0aC1yZXBvcnQuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon to close scrap plans for dozens of warehouses amid slowing sales growth: report,"article

Amazon is reportedly scrapping plans to build dozens of warehouse facilities across the United States amid slowed sales growth.

The consulting firm MWPVL says that the online retail giant is either closing or abandoning plans to open 42 facilities across the country totaling almost 25 million square feet of usable space Bloomberg reported.

The firm says that Amazon has also delayed opening 21 other locations and canceled several European projects mostly in Spain.

""Amazon is a dynamic business and we are constantly exploring new locations"" Amazon spokesperson Maria Boschetti told Fox News Digital. ""We weigh a variety of factors when deciding where to develop future sites to best serve customers. We have dozens of fulfillment centers sortation centers and delivery stations under construction and evolving around the world. It‚Äôs common for us to explore multiple locations simultaneously and adjust timetables based on needs across the network.""

The report comes after it was announced the company is closing two delivery stations in Maryland that employ more than 300 people.

Amazon posted its slowest growth rate in more than 20 years in July but ultimately posted better results than expected which caused the stock to jump 12% the New York Times reported.

""Despite continued inflationary pressures in fuel energy and transportation costs we‚Äôre making progress on the more controllable costs we referenced last quarter particularly improving the productivity of our fulfillment network"" Andy Jassy Amazon‚Äôs chief executive said in a statement at the time.

Jing Gao and Eddie Levine have both worked in e-commerce for more than a decade. Eddie Levine

Eddie Levine and Jing Gao first met at an Atlanta e-commerce conference in 2016. Two years later they shared their first kiss outside an Amazon seller summit in New Orleans. And in 2020 Gao left her home in Los Angeles to move in with Levine in Chicago bringing their e-commerce businesses under one roof. So it only made sense that when it came time to tie the knot they turned to e-commerce for their inspiration. On Aug. 21 the couple tied the knot in Chicago and the wedding reception was filled with Amazon paraphernalia. At the reception guests were seated at tables designated by a ten-digit code used to look up products on Amazon's website (known as an ASIN in seller parlance). Wedding favors were tiny Amazon packages complete with barcodes and filled with treats placed in miniature shopping carts.

Attendees posed for photos in front of a backdrop declaring ""Jeddie (a combination of the couples' first names) Prime Day"" an homage to Amazon's annual summer shopping bonanza. Although the references were a little bit esoteric at least the couple was confident that some of their guests would understand them. Levine gave a toast during the reception. ""I said 'Last but certainly not least e-commerce brought us together. If we have met you as a result of e-commerce directly or indirectly stand up"" he told CNBC in an interview. ""Literally half of our guests stood up."" Not everyone got it though. ""The bartender was like 'Can you tell me what the deal is with all the Amazon-inspired stuff?"" said Robyn Johnson CEO of digital marketing agency Marketplace Blueprint and a friend of the couple who attended the wedding.

Both Levine and Gao have worked in e-commerce for more than a decade. Levine is president and co-founder of Hub Dub which helps brands manage their businesses online and provides logistics services. Gao runs an Amazon business selling home d√©cor products. Levine and Gao are part of an active community of sellers consultants and service providers that's sprung up around Amazon's third-party marketplace. Launched in 2000 the marketplace has become a centerpiece of its dominant e-commerce business as it now accounts for more than half of online retail sales. As of 2021 there were more than six million third-party sellers worldwide on the Amazon marketplace according to research firm Marketplace Pulse.

This one is oddly satisfying in terms of the person getting what they deserve‚Ä¶

American Airlines passenger goes on racist & homophobic rant

On Tuesday a man was traveling on an American Airlines flight from Philadelphia (PHL) to Dallas (DFW). He ended up being removed from the plane as he was allegedly ‚Äúinappropriate‚Äù toward the woman seated next to him.

When it was decided that he would be removed from the plane the man had a meltdown. He allegedly repeatedly and loudly used the ‚Äún-word‚Äù toward the flight attendant and that‚Äôs when the video recording started.

The guy went on an epic rant at this point while acknowledging that he was a ‚Äúlittle‚Äù intoxicated:

‚ÄúAre you going to kick me off this f*cking flight with all these f*ggots?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a black f*cking bag yeah obviously I‚Äôm a white man who picked a black f*cking bag because I‚Äôm racist.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll get off the f*cking plane with you liberal f*ggots.‚Äù

‚ÄúI hope all you liberal f*ggots f*cking crash the f*cking plane you f*cking f*ggots.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a chemical engineer I work for GlaxoSmithKline. I‚Äôm about to quit the f*cking job this week reach out to the company one of the f*ggots companies in the world.‚Äù

You can see the video for yourself below (though it obviously has bad language so watch it at your own discretion).

https://twitter.com/Imposter_Edits/status/1565500907227340807

My two takeaways from this incident

Huge credit to the American Airlines flight attendants for how they handled this situation. They deescalated the conflict and were incredibly calm even though this guy continued to cross the line verbally assaulting the flight attendant.

All too often we see crews escalate situations or get on the passenger‚Äôs level but that‚Äôs not the case here. I hope American recognizes the flight attendants for how they acted here and uses this as an example of how crews should handle situations.

Next it‚Äôs interesting that within a few days of the incident GlaxoSmithKline announced that this particular employee is no longer employed at the company. Admittedly he claimed he was planning on quitting the following week ‚Äî whether or not that was true is unknown.

On Wednesday GSK was notified of an incident involving an employee on a flight to Dallas. We immediately conducted an investigation and as of Thursday he is no longer employed at GSK. The person‚Äôs behavior was reprehensible and does not reflect our company culture. ‚Äî GSK US (@GSKUS) September 2 2022

In general I‚Äôm hesitant to share stories like this since often people have some sort of mental health situation that causes them to act out of order.

In this case the guy acknowledges he‚Äôs ‚Äúa bit drunk‚Äù and at the end of the day alcohol often brings out the truth. I‚Äôm pretty confident that his hate speech reflects how he really feels even if he has to cover it up most of the time. You don‚Äôt just go on homophobic and racist tirades for no reason. That‚Äôs not normal.

I also don‚Äôt understand when people try to ‚Äúflex‚Äù their jobs while going on an embarrassing rant like this? Like is he trying to point out he‚Äôs a classy and well-paid racist and homophobe or how exactly is his career choice a defense for his actions?

Bottom line

A man was removed from an American Airlines flight after making several racist and homophobic comments. While the man admitted he was drunk that of course doesn‚Äôt excuse his behavior and clearly he has some issues related to race and sexual orientation.

This guy deserved to be fired. He claims he was planning on quitting anyway though hopefully this behavior is brought to the attention of wherever he works next.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8wMy90ZWNoL2luZmxpZ2h0LXdpZmktdGVjaG5vbG9neS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFAaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8wOS8wMy90ZWNoL2luZmxpZ2h0LXdpZmktdGVjaG5vbG9neQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How airlines give you internet access at 35000 feet ‚Äî and why it still needs a lot of work,"CNN Business ‚Äî

Flights used to be a chance to sit back (albeit a bit cramped) and watch a recently released movie or catch up on some reading. Now they‚Äôre just another place to log on.

Delta and United each host more than 1.5 million inflight WiFi sessions a month the airlines told CNN Business while JetBlue said its service is used by ‚Äúmillions of customers‚Äù every year. Southwest declined to share specific numbers but said inflight Wifi is ‚Äúpopular.‚Äù

Alaska Airlines meanwhile estimates that about 35% of its passengers on average make use of its $8 onboard WiFi services which include surfing the web and streaming.

While most airlines will allow certain messaging apps for free full internet access in the skies usually comes at a premium with Delta charging nearly $50 for a monthly pass on US flights (though the airline plans to switch to a $5 per flight per device offering by the end of this year). But with a market that‚Äôs currently estimated at around $5 billion and projected to grow to more than $12 billion by 2030 according to research firm Verified Market Research there‚Äôs a lot of room for improvement.

Inflight internet has been around for nearly two decades with aircraft manufacturer Boeing announcing its service known as Connexion in April 2000 and debuting it on a Munich-Los Angeles Lufthansa flight in 2004. Boeing discontinued the service in 2006 saying the market for it had ‚Äúnot materialized‚Äù as expected. But the advent of smartphones and subsequent efforts by a host of satellite providers and airlines have helped the technology evolve significantly in the past decade ‚Äî though it still has some catching up to do in order to compare to home and office networks.

How it works

There are two main types of inflight connections. The first known as air-to-ground or ATG relies on antennae attached to the aircraft that catch the signal from cellphone towers on the ground.

Intelsat which launched air-to-ground services with American Airlines in 2008 currently operates a version of the technology on more than 1000 aircraft across North America.

The one major drawback of this technology is that much like cellphone service on the ground it is dependent on the density and connectivity of towers and so flights over rural areas deserts or large water bodies are likely to suffer drops in connectivity. The maximum speeds for these systems are currently around 5 megabits per second (which is shared by hundreds of passengers) according to Andrew Zignani a research director at technology intelligence firm ABI Research who specializes in wireless connectivity. By comparison median global download speeds for mobile and fixed broadband are around 30 megabits per second and 67 megabits per second respectively according to recent data from monitoring app Speedtest.

‚ÄúTo date the biggest issues have been speed limited availability gaps in coverage dropouts and price‚Äù Zignani told CNN Business.

That‚Äôs why airlines and providers are increasingly switching to satellite-based connections that are relatively less susceptible to interruptions because they can more effectively cover the entirety of the flight path from space and keep the signal active as it moves through the air.

That includes Intelsat which has a network of over 50 satellites serving airlines such as Alaska American Delta United Air Canada British Airways and Cathay Pacific.

‚ÄúAs regional jet fleets are refreshed we expect the majority to migrate to satellite-based solutions‚Äù Jeff Sare Intelsat‚Äôs president of commercial aviation told CNN Business.

Viasat another major provider used by several airlines around the world uses its own network of satellites that provide high-speed connectivity and is gearing up to launch another satellite constellation later this year. The company debuted its services with JetBlue in 2013 and now serves more than a dozen airlines around the world.

But even satellite connections are currently capable of around 100 megabits per second per aircraft or around 15 megabits per second per passenger device a far cry from the speeds terrestrial WiFi is capable of.

Many airlines use a combination of WiFi providers and types of technologies depending on the type of aircraft and routes they need to be deployed on.

Newer players such as Starlink the satellite internet service run by billionaire Elon Musk‚Äôs company SpaceX are also entering the fray. Earlier this year SpaceX announced a partnership with Hawaiian Airlines to provide high-speed internet through Starlink‚Äôs network of low-earth orbit satellites.

‚ÄúSome of these solutions also adopt a hybrid approach combining the best of both technologies to ensure optimal coverage depending on the specific flight path‚Äù said Zignani. ‚ÄúI believe we will see opportunities for all technologies in the coming years and recent partnerships are showing that each technology will have its own part to play‚Äù he added.

Challenges and opportunities

There are still gaps between inflight WiFi and the networks you would use in your home office a coffee shop or anywhere on the ground.

While most airline WiFi connections now support messaging and social media functions and some even have live TV and video streaming capabilities providing users with the same level of bandwidth and connectivity mid-air can be a challenge.

‚ÄúThe biggest point of difference for inflight WiFi is the complexity added by the mobility element‚Äù Don Buchman vice president and general manager for commercial aviation at Viasat told CNN Business. ‚ÄúThe aircraft is traveling at a high rate of speed typically banking during the flight and often flying across large geographical areas that demand consistent coverage for a high-quality in-flight connectivity experience.‚Äù

And while satellites solve for some of the restrictions that cellphone towers face expanding the satellite network to keep up with increasing demand is not always straightforward.

As Sare of Intelsat puts it: ‚ÄúIt is much faster and cheaper to deploy new cellular towers than to launch a satellite on a rocket.‚Äù

In a survey by Intelsat last year of airlines service providers and equipment manufacturers 65% of respondents said they anticipate increases in the number of passengers who expect to be connected while flying. The two biggest impediments to increasing inflight WiFi adoption the survey indicated were the high price of the service and ‚Äúpoor internet connection.‚Äù

Companies such as Viasat Intelsat and Starlink continue to expand that capacity however launching more satellites every year in anticipation of the growing demand for their services. That added capacity will not only enhance the online experience for users but could also potentially give airlines more avenues to monetize and lower the price.

‚ÄúOne example is ad sponsored inflight WiFi so passengers can access WiFi for free and use it however they would like‚Äù Buchman said adding that Viasat is also exploring ways to use its connectivity services to help airlines with functions such as crew management and aircraft maintenance.

The biggest priority according to Sare of Intelsat is shortening the time it takes to make those technological advances happen and he foresees more partnerships between companies to help move the industry standard forward.

‚ÄúOur vision is achieved when passengers can‚Äôt tell the difference between being connected on the ground and in the air.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1bi1zZW50aW5lbC5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8wMy9yaXNreS1idXNpbmVzcy1oaWdoZXItYWlycG9ydC1mZWVzLW1heS1iZS10b28tbXVjaC1mb3ItY29uc3VtZXJzLWFpcmxpbmVzLXRvLWJlYXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Higher airport fees could mean higher fares for travlers,"Roger Simmons / Orlando Sentinel

Why activists in New York Maine and elsewhere are pushing for public power.,"For Daniel Atonna access to utilities is a personal matter.

Atonna who grew up in New York's Hudson Valley said his family couldn't always afford to heat their home. On some nights when the heat wasn't running he and his sister accompanied their mother to her overnight shifts at a nearby nursing home. The two would sleep in the facility's lobby ensuring they were able to stay warm.

Now 24 years old Atonna said his family's experiences with privately owned power companies have in part inspired his work organizing for a different system in New York: Publicly owned and government-operated utilities.

""These private utilities are not up to the task"" Atonna said. ""They can't even maintain the current energy grid let alone get us prepared for the future.""

Atonna is political coordinator of For The Many a grassroots organization championing progressive causes across The Empire State. The first step toward a new statewide energy economy he said could be the Build Public Renewables Act. The legislation passed the state Senate in June but the Assembly failed to take up a vote before the end of its latest session leaving the bill in limbo.

The act if signed into law would expand the reach of the New York Power Authority a state-owned utility that provides power to public buildings and schools. It would allow the utility to serve businesses and homes across the state requiring an eventual transition to exclusively renewable energy sources and significant infrastructure investments.

The New York act is one of many efforts across the nation to implement publicly-owned sources of energy. Such utilities generate about 10% of the country's electricity according to the American Public Power Association and supporters are looking to increase that percentage.

Activists are rallying in other states too ‚Äì including Illinois Massachusetts and Michigan.

Organizers at municipal and state levels say the practice would eliminate the incentivization of profit that comes with privately-owned utilities while also allowing customers to more easily hold companies accountable for their service.

Opponents meanwhile remain concerned about the costs of investments associated with a shift to public power and many doubt whether such a model would fulfill its promises.

""With major projects in the works from private investors and the benefits that consumers see there is no reason to shake that up by allowing NYPA into the fold"" Gavin Donohue president of trade association Independent Power Producers of New York said in a statement. ""Why change up the competitive procurement process when private independent energy companies are more than willing to continue investing in New York?""

The history of US public power utilities

To trace the history of public utilities it's important to start with the first American power grids created in the 1880s.

At first electricity was a luxury afforded only to the rich through private utilities according to Michael Menser the director of Urban Sustainability Studies at Brooklyn College. But it didn't take long before access expanded with towns constructing their own grids for both private and public utilities he said.

CLIMATE POINT:Subscribe to USA TODAY‚Äôs free weekly newsletter on climate change the environment and the weather

Throughout the next few decades public power grids became more widespread with large expansions into the beginning of the 1920s. But soon after their fate would change as private utilities rapidly began buying up their public counterparts Menser said.

While public grids do still exist nearly a century later ‚Äì most notably in Nebraska the only state served wholly by a consumer-owned power system ‚Äì Menser told USA TODAY he's seen a recent resurgence in the push to create more such utilities.

Though Menser identified a range of possible explanations for the shift he described racial disparities in service and climate activism around renewable energy as primary drivers.

""When climate change intensifies storms and fires have also increased"" Menser said . ""In many cases private utilities don‚Äôt seem to be accountable after the event. So that's another thing that made people realize we need a much more accountable entity.""

A governor's veto in Maine

Wil Thieme became interested in the issue of public utilities after realizing it centered two subjects he cared about: Monopoly ownership and sustainability.

Thieme of Cumberland Maine learned about the push for public power in July 2021 and has since been elected as a co-chair of the Maine Public Power campaign.

Democratic Gov. Janet Mills vetoed a bill in July 2021 that would have with voter approval authorized the replacement of the state's two largest electricity companies with a publicly owned utility. In her veto letter Mills expressed concerns about the legislation‚Äôs plans for financing and regulation.

""There may be a way to create a utility with a professional governing board that is clearly eligible to issue low-interest tax-exempt bonds that would save ratepayers money achieve better connectivity with solar and other renewables and further the climate goals of this Administration"" Mills wrote at the time. ""But L.D. 1708 hastily drafted and hastily amended in recent weeks without robust public participation is a patchwork of political promises rather than a methodical reformation of Maine‚Äôs complicated electrical transmission and distribution system.""

Since then Thieme told USA TODAY that Maine Public Power has been collecting signatures in support of a statewide referendum that could overturn Mills' veto. They're facing strongopposition from privately owned utility companies he said.

""They lobby aggressively against anything that could potentially hurt their profits"" Thieme said. ""It's not great when you're trying to get real progress so a change is going to be very helpful in terms of getting climate bills passed.""

The opposing viewpoint: Private utilities could provide the most effective path to meeting sustainability goals.

CLIMATE CHANGE? The Inflation Reduction Act's surprise winner the U.S. oil and gas industry.

""To achieve our climate and grid modernization objectives we need everyone working together"" John Flynn president of statewide utility Versant Power said in legislative testimony in May 2021. ""We don‚Äôt have time or money to waste on polarizing fights.""

Marie Therese Kane an organizer with We Power D.C. said many members of the public power movement joined looking to take drastic steps to address climate change. With a public utility company Kane said there is a unique opportunity for direct accountability especially in meeting climate goals that doesn‚Äôt exist to the same extent in a privatized system.

‚Äã‚Äã""A lot of folks are disenchanted by traditional environmental organizations‚Äô focus on individual behavior change or incremental units ‚Äì efforts that don't account for the political reality"" Kane told USA TODAY. ""The movements for public power have an opportunity in something that can attack the systemic causes of something like climate change.""

A fight 'worth fighting' in New York

The supporters of public power still face significant obstacles ‚Äì even after sparking conversation at some statehouses.

In New York for example the opposition to additional public utilities starts in the organization that activists are trying to expand. Justin Driscoll NYPA‚Äôs interim president and Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul‚Äôs nominee to fill the permanent role opposes the Build Public Renewables Act much to the chagrin of organizers.

""NYPA does not believe that we have a cost advantage in developing renewable generation"" Driscoll said in a July special hearing discussing the act. ""The bill's mandates like those directing NYPA to develop renewable energy projects and provide energy services and imposing limits on what NYPA may charge for that power are simply unworkable.""

Still for Atonna the need for public utilities in New York ‚Äì and the passage of the Build Public Renewables Act ‚Äì remains clear.

""This is really an agency that is uniquely positioned to do some amazing things right now"" he said. ""What we need to do is unleash its full potential.""

And then what?

""Just because something is public doesn't necessarily mean it's good"" said Aaron Eisenberg 31 another member of Public Power New York. ‚ÄúBut the fight for a democratically accountable public institution and utility? That's worth fighting for.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vZWFydGhvYnNlcnZhdG9yeS5uYXNhLmdvdi9pbWFnZXMvMTUwMjk3L3RoZS1nZXlzZXJzLW9mLWNhbGlmb3JuaWHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Geysers of California,"About 1.3 million years ago a large blob of silica-rich magma forced its way through Earth‚Äôs crust beneath the Coast Range of northern California. Today that shallow rock body is still piping hot and the 45-square-mile area above it is known as The Geysers‚Äîthe world‚Äôs largest energy producing geothermal field.

Although the nearby Clear Lake volcanic field was still erupting as recently as a few thousand years ago there were never any geysers at this geothermal field. The Geysers is a misnomer that came from 19th century settlers to the area who misunderstood the hot springs and fumaroles bubbling and steaming away in the canyon of Big Sulphur Creek. From the mid-19th to the mid-20th century a popular resort hotel operated in the area while indigenous people of the region have visited the springs since prehistoric times.

Situated about 8 miles (13 kilometers) northeast of Geyserville the site is now home to 18 power plants that use steam to drive turbines to generate electricity. The white roofs of several of the power plants appear in this natural-color image acquired by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8 on January 10 2022.

The steam-driven turbines in this area can generate 725 megawatts of electricity enough to power a city the size of San Francisco. The Geysers typically supplies the power needs of Sonoma Lake and Mendocino counties as well as a portion of Marin and Napa counties. As of 2018 turbines in the Geysers area produced 50 percent of California‚Äôs geothermal power.

Geothermal energy is produced by capturing heat from within the Earth either via natural steam or very hot water. It is a reliable and renewable source of energy that can be available whether or not the Sun is shining or the wind is blowing.

Three elements are needed to produce geothermal energy: magma close to the surface fractured or permeable rock and fluids that can circulate through the heated rock. At The Geysers the body of rock that intruded over a million years ago lies just 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) below the surface. Deeper parts below 1.5 miles (2.5 kilometers) can reach temperatures of 750¬∞F (400¬∞C).

While most geothermal power plants tap into water reservoirs the Geysers system is one of only two vapor-dominated systems in the world according to the U.S. Geological Survey. This means the formation produces steam directly which can more efficiently be tapped to produce electricity.

A small steam-engine generator was first used to produce electricity here in the 1920s and the first modern geothermal well was drilled in 1955. Over several decades further drilling and development by various operators brought The Geysers to its peak-production in 1987 when 21 power plants had a capacity of more than 2000 megawatts. Then power production began to decline as the steam reservoir began to tap out.

In the mid-1990s to sustain energy production and extend the life of the field plant operators turned to a practice called enhanced geothermal systems (EGS). Water is injected at high pressure to reopen the natural fractures in the rock and allow hot water or steam to flow into wells. Today two pipelines deliver treated wastewater from Lake County and the city of Santa Rosa to recharge the reservoir.

Pierluigi Paganini September 04 2022 September 04 2022

Cybersecurity firm Armorblox discovered a new phishing campaign aimed at American Express customers.

Armorblox researchers uncovered a new phishing campaign that is targeting American Express customers.

The messages use a malicious attachment and their content attempt to trick cardholders into opening it.

The subject of the emails reads ‚ÄúImportant Notification About Your Account‚Äù in an attempt to urge recipients to open it. Once opened the email appears as a legitimate email communication from American Express while the content instructs the cardholder on how to view the secure encrypted message attached.

‚ÄúUpon opening the attachment victims were greeted with a message announcing additional verification requirements for the associated account. Urgency was instilled within the victims through the inclusion of the language ‚ÄúThis is your last chance to confirm it before we suspend it‚Äù and a prompt for victims to complete a one-time verification process that was needed as part of a global update from the American Express team.‚Äù reads the analysis published by the Armorblox.

Upon clicking on the link in the message victims are redirected to a fake American Express login page which includes the company‚Äôs logo and a link to download the American Express app.

The page was crafted to request the victims to enter their user ID and password.

The phishing campaign bypassed native Google Workspace email security controls because it passed both DKIM and SPF email authentication.

Threat actors behind the campaign used a valid domain to send this malicious email the domain used by the sender received a reputation score of trustworthy and global threat history of zero security events. The phishing email marked by Google as safe was delivered to more than 16000 users‚Äô addresses.

Below are the recommendations provided by Armorblox to identify phishing messages:

Augment native email security with additional controls;

Watch out for social engineering cues;

Follow multi-factor authentication and password management best practices;

Last night the Greatest of All Time lost to Ajla Tomljanoviƒá in the third round at the US Open.

Throughout the three-hour match the adoring New York City crowd roared in cheers for Williams as she showed again and again why she is the GOAT. But at the end Tomljanoviƒá who is considered 46th in the world beat Williams 7-6 6-7 6-1 in what would instantly become an iconic and bittersweet defeat.

In the last minute Williams hit a ball to the net giving Tomljanoviƒá her winning point. With tears streaming down her face the tennis pro put her hand over her heart and took in the crowd. In the stands fans including Bella Hadid Ciara Gayle King and Spike Lee clapped cheered and cried with her while giving her a standing ovation. Williams twirled her signature twirl and gave a final wave before stepping off the court to Tina Turner's ""Simply the Best.""

Harper's BAZAAR was among the attendees last night at the stadium's American Express Center Court Club where screens zoomed in on Williams as she gave an emotional post-match interview on the court.

""Oh my god thank you so much you guys were amazing today"" she said. ""Thank you Daddy I know you're watching. Thanks Mom. Thank you everyone that's here that's been on my side‚Äîso many years literally decades. But it all started with my parents and they deserve everything. So I'm really grateful for them.""

""These are happy tears I guess. I don't know"" she continued. ""And I wouldn't be Serena if there wasn't Venus so thank you Venus. She's the only reason Serena Williams ever existed ... It's been a fun ride. It's been the most incredible ride and journey I've ever been on.""

In her court interview Tomljanovic too praised Williams.

""I'm feeling really sorry just because I love Serena just as much as you guys do. And what she's done for me for the sport of tennis is incredible"" she said calling the moment‚Äîher first time passing the quarterfinals at any major‚Äî""surreal.""

""I just thought she would beat me. ... She's Serena. That's that's just who she is: She's the greatest of all time. Period"" Tomljanovic added.

American Express who is offering immersive tennis experiences and fine dining throughout the US Open for members in their Centurion suite spoke to BAZAAR about what it was like hosting fans for Williams's final match. ""Our Card Members know when they're with Amex they have access to life‚Äôs unforgettable and epic moments like last night‚Äôs history-making match. The energy in Arthur Ashe was off-the-charts and will certainly go down as a 'member when' experience for our Card Members"" they said.

Williams announced her retirement from tennis last month in an emotional essay published on Vogue in which she wrote candidly about the point she is at in her life‚Äîand the balancing act she plays every day trying to be both the world-renowned star athlete she is on the tennis court and the mom and wife her family needs her to be. She said that though it was not an easy choice to make she is ready for the next phase and looking forward to expanding her family.

""I don't want it to be over but at the same time I'm ready for what's next"" she wrote. ""I don't know how I'm going to be able to look at this magazine when it comes out knowing that this is it the end of a story that started in Compton California with a little Black girl who just wanted to play tennis. This sport has given me so much.""

""But I'm not looking for some ceremonial final on-court moment"" she added. ""I'm terrible at goodbyes the world's worst. But please know that I am more grateful for you than I can ever express in words. You have carried me to so many wins and so many trophies. I'm going to miss that version of me that girl who played tennis. And I'm going to miss you.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzb3Blbi5vcmcvZW5fVVMvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA5LTA0L3RoaW5nc190b19rbm93X3BsYXlfdGVubmlzX2NsYXNoX2R1cmluZ190aGVfMjAyMl91c19vcGVuLmh0bWzSAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy51c29wZW4ub3JnL2FtcC9lbl9VUy9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMDktMDQvdGhpbmdzX3RvX2tub3dfcGxheV90ZW5uaXNfY2xhc2hfZHVyaW5nX3RoZV8yMDIyX3VzX29wZW4uaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Things to Know: Play Tennis Clash during the 2022 US Open,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9yZXZpZXctcHJpbWVjbGFzcy1kb21lc3RpYy1sb3VuZ2UtYXQtbWlsYXMtYm9kcnVtLWFpcnBvcnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: The Primeclass Domestic Lounge At Milas Bodrum Airport,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9yZXZpZXctcHJpbWVjbGFzcy1kb21lc3RpYy1sb3VuZ2UtYXQtbWlsYXMtYm9kcnVtLWFpcnBvcnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWFuZGxldHNmbHkuY29tL2RlbHRhLWpmay1sb3VuZ2UtY3Jvd2Rpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hilarious: Lines So Bad At Delta SkyClub Passengers Are Fed While Waiting Outside,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWFuZGxldHNmbHkuY29tL2RlbHRhLWpmay1sb3VuZ2UtY3Jvd2Rpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016710B36020>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWFuZGxldHNmbHkuY29tL2RlbHRhLWpmay1sb3VuZ2UtY3Jvd2Rpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

TIMELINE

March 2022: according to a report by the United States Customs and Border Protection Agency 8387 Salvadorans were prevented from entering the country irregularly which is an increase from the 7146 in February 2021

2022: UNHCR estimates that in 2022 the number of deportations will reach approximately 50000 of which 10000 will have protection needs (20 percent of the total number of deportees).

May 2022: IOM reports 6471 returnees for the period January to May 2022 an increase of 254% over the previous year.

29 July 2022: 7 National Societies decide to scale up their response and together with IFRC launch an Emergency Appeal to support the National Societies of Central America and Mexico for 18 million CHF to assist 210000 people for 12 months. 1 million CHF allocated from the IFRC‚Äôs Disaster Response Emergency Fund (DREF) to kick off the operation.

DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT

Despite official information on the reduction in the number and rate of homicides registered since 2019 in El Salvador the persistence of crime and violence continue to be a threat to social development and economic growth in the country and constitute the main causes for which the population continues to be victims of situations of forced internal displacement as well as catalysts for the migration of people from El Salvador to other countries in search of international protection. The deep socioeconomic and gender inequality the impact of COVID-19 and the effects of natural hazards and disasters combined with the population's vulnerability conditions contribute to the deterioration of the protection context.

In this context it is clear and necessary to address the situation of internally displaced persons who are seeking a safe place within the country and migrants who risk traveling the migratory route to reach new destinations. Many of them are subsequently deported and forced to return (ICRC).

In 2022 6471 Salvadoran migrant returnees from the United States and Mexico were reported an increase of 254% compared to the previous year. In addition according to a report by the United States Customs and Border Protection Agency 8387 Salvadorans were prevented from entering the country irregularly in March 2022 an increase from the 7146 in February 2021. According to official records in 2022 there was a 209% increase in deportations from the United States and Mexico compared to the same period in 2021.

According to the Humanitarian Response Plan for El Salvador forced displacement has a multidimensional negative effect on the exercise of rights. At the community level the lack of state presence and the social and territorial control of gangs hinder displaced persons access to rights and services. To mitigate risks people affected by violence often limit their movements aggravating their situation and affecting their sources of income. Once they flee their community displaced persons leave behind their property belongings education and employment opportunities. In addition displacement entails the loss of social community and family networks while generating new challenges related to the establishment of the family in a new place.

Severity of humanitarian conditions

Upon arrival returning migrants in El Salvador suffer discrimination that limits their reintegration into their communities of origin. The stigma that follows them is usually associated with crime. Other returnees have physical and mental health problems or have been victims of sexual abuse in transit. Some returnees fled and were forcibly displaced and feel threatened to return to their place of origin.

Some of the factors of departure were family reunification uprooting adverse weather conditions that have contributed to the loss of jobs and the closure of businesses in the communities of origin which makes it difficult to generate livelihoods.

Impact on accessibility to basic services such as food health education electricity among others.

Migrants and/or displaced persons face many shortages and challenges along the migration route. In El Salvador involuntary returnees generally do not have the resources to access the material goods necessary to reintegrate into their communities of origin (food clothing health housing) or in some cases due to the generalized violence and security issues they have no possibility of returning home.

Many people generally leave the country due to violence perpetuated by illegal groups (gangs) and when they return they require protection and an immediate response to their urgent needs. Most of them are in urgent need of cash to pay for food medicine and clothing and shelter housing in case of individuals or families who are unable to return to their place of origin.

The few governmental organizations do not have the resources to provide the humanitarian aid required for migrants in the short and medium term. The migrant and displaced population specially those who are victims of violence require humanitarian assistance and protection to alleviate their suffering; to protect their lives and guarantee respect for their rights without any form of discrimination based on age race colour sex language religion birth political ideology or other status.

Impact on physical and mental well-being

Today migration is a global phenomenon and should be recognized as a social determinant of health. Mobility not only has an impact on people's physical vulnerability but also on their mental and social well-being.

Conditions related to the migration process can increase vulnerability to disease. The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to increased risk of infection and death for migrants and internally displaced persons. People on the move may have few tools to protect themselves such as social distancing hand hygiene and self-isolation which are often not possible.

While this clearly has an impact on the well-being of migrants and internally displaced persons it has a negative impact on global health objectives such as HIV prevention and containment of tuberculosis among others. High morbidity and mortality rates among migrants especially among those in irregular or forced situations are also a key health concern that is underestimated and deserves attention.

People on the move also experience a series of reactions and feelings that affect their mental health so mental health and psychosocial support services that facilitate the management of such impacts are essential to cope with them. According to data from the Protection and Information System of the Psychosocial Care Unit for Victims of Violence (UAPV) of the Salvadoran Red Cross the main impacts of containment and mitigation measures on the mental health of the population served have been:

‚Ä¢ In girls and boys from 4 to 8 years old: behavioural problems stress anxiety eating disorders are the ones that are mostly reflected in children served.

‚Ä¢ In girls and boys from 8 to 12 years old: Increase of defiant or aggressive behaviours anger irritability complaints of boredom sleep disturbances depression worry and anxiety due to fear of being harmed by violence.

‚Ä¢ In adolescents (12 to 17 years old): Increased defiant and aggressive behaviours thoughts of hopelessness recurrent fear and worry.

‚Ä¢ In adults and families: There is the prevalence of generalized anxiety and symptoms of depression mainly related to the acts of violence perpetrated mainly by armed groups. There is a fear of receiving threats and extortion by gangs that exercise territorial control in the area. There are reports of anguish due to the presence of police and army troops in the last month of March. Similarly cases of displacement due to police harassment have been reported who link them to gangs in their areas of residence and at the same time there has been an increase in the intention to migrate as a result of the security situation in the country.

Victims of violence in conditions of displacement identify that from the moment they suffer a threat of displacement until the moment they must return and relocate to a new community anxiety always remains constant due to the fear of being persecuted and found.

Impact on their livelihoods

The ""Study of the labour market focused on the identification of possibilities for self-employment and labour linkage of internally displaced population and population in need of international protection"" carried out by the company CID Gallup and UNHCR in El Salvador shows that one fifth of the population is unemployed and although 17% expect to be employed in administrative positions only 5% of the people have technical education.

Of those who are employed almost half are working informally and 73% of people want to start a business but have little economic solvency. The study also shows that approximately four out of every five people consider that obtaining a job in El Salvador is ""difficult (very or somewhat)"". This reality is especially acute for women (64% - very difficult) and for the population over 40 years of age (66% ""very difficult""). In turn people with disabilities suffer from the hard task of finding employment as almost half (47%) consider this to be a ""very or somewhat difficult"" task. Forty-two percent of those surveyed managed to find employment before the second month after arriving at their current residence. Men take less time to find a job - at least before the end of the first month of unemployment - than women. It is mostly women who work in the informal sector.

Migrants need to secure their livelihoods to meet their basic needs and improve their living conditions. In that sense the multipurpose may contribute to start their economic activities in sectors with market potential beyond the period of assistance.

Protection Gender and Inclusion

Migrants who have been affected by violence exploitation or abuse require assistance and protection to address their immediate needs and their risk factors. At each stage of the migration route many migrants face discrimination lack of access to fundamental human rights xenophobia violence gender inequality threats of exploitation by human traffickers migrant smugglers or unscrupulous officials.

They also have to face health and other physical threats related to travel conditions such as unsafe means of transportation environmental exposure and infectious diseases.

Upon returning home migrants may acquire new vulnerabilities caused for example by language barriers integration difficulties and xenophobia. Irregular migrants are particularly reluctant to avail themselves of social services for fear of being detected even when they are entitled to them.

As Salvadoran Red Cross the priority is to work to reduce the stigmatization of the migrant population and displaced victims of violence by generating promoting outreach campaigns in social networks for the prevention of gender-based violence self-care days with returned migrant women victims of violence adaptation and socialization of the guide for the creation of safe referral mechanisms reproduction of the safe referral guide for people in migrant and refugee situations; and reproduction of key messages with relevant information for people.

Security

The biggest security risk in El Salvador is opportunistic and violent crime Migrant travellers are unlikely to be targeted by gangs but may face the risk of incidental exposure if they unknowingly travel into a gang-held neighbourhoods. Migrants and supporting staff to the Honduran border region should consider travelling or seeking advice with local guides due to the presence of landmines and unexploded ordnance close to the border.

The fate of 13 former American colonies was agreed upon and the borders of the new republic were agreed upon: Florida north to the Great Lakes and the Atlantic coast west to the Mississippi River.

The events leading up to the treaty extended to April 1775 in a common green area in Lexington Massachusetts when the American colonists responded to King George III's refusal to grant them political and economic reform by armed revolution according to History.

On July 4 1776 more than a year after the start of the war the Second Continental Congress formally adopted the Declaration of Independence. After five difficult years in October 1781 British General Charles Lord Cornwallis surrendered to American and French forces at Yorktown Virginia ending the last major battle of the Revolution.

In September 1782 Benjamin Franklin along with John Adams and John Jay began formal peace negotiations with the British. The Continental Congress originally appointed a five-person panel including Franklin Adams and Jay along with Thomas Jefferson and Henry Lorenz to conduct the talks. However both Jefferson and Lawrence missed the sessions.

Jefferson was late to travel and Laurens was captured by the British and kept in the Tower of London. The American delegation distrusting the French chose to negotiate separately with the British.

During the talks Franklin demanded that Britain hand over Canada to the United States. This did not happen but America gained enough new territory south of the Canadian border to double its size. The United States has also successfully negotiated important fishing rights in Canadian waters.

Two months later the main details have been worked out. On November 30 1782 the United States and Britain signed the preliminary articles of the treaty. France signed its initial peace treaty with Britain on January 20 1783. Then in September of that year the final treaty was signed by the three countries and Spain. The Continental Congress ratified the Treaty of Paris on January 14 1784.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDMvdXMvc3VyZnNpZGUtY29uZG8tY29sbGFwc2UtanVkZ2UuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Judge‚Äôs Handling of Surfside Condo Collapse Case Yields Rapid Payout for Victims,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDMvdXMvc3VyZnNpZGUtY29uZG8tY29sbGFwc2UtanVkZ2UuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001671094D300>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDMvdXMvc3VyZnNpZGUtY29uZG8tY29sbGFwc2UtanVkZ2UuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlemVlbi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8wMy9zdXBlcnRhbGwtc2t5c2NyYXBlcnMtYmVpbmctYnVpbHQtYXJvdW5kLXRoZS13b3JsZC1yb3VuZHVwcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fifteen supertall skyscrapers being built around the world,"To mark World Skyscraper Day Dezeen has rounded up 15 supertall skyscrapers that are set to be built in cities across the globe including a pair of twisting towers in Australia and the buildings battling to become Africa's tallest.

For some an inspiring beacon of progress and for others emblematic of economic inequalities neck-craning skyscrapers continue to capture the public imagination.

The vast majority of tall buildings have been constructed in the past two decades and this trend shows no sign of slowing down as cities around the world build ever higher.

Supertall skyscrapers which are buildings over 300 metres tall are increasingly appearing in our cities. Dezeen recently highlighted 11 supertall skyscrapers that have had a major impact in the past 10 years and looked at six supertalls set to join the skylines of North American cities.

Below are 15 skyscrapers being built around the world each in a different city:

Merdeka 118 Kuala Lumpur Malaysia by Fender Katsalidis

Merdeka 118 took the title of the world's second-tallest building from Shanghai Tower late last year when it topped out at a megatall height of 678.9 metres with completion expected towards the end of 2022.

Designed by Australian studio Fender Katsalidis the 118-storey building features a faceted facade composed of triangular glass planes modelled on patterns found in Malaysian art and craft.

A District Tokyo Japan by Pelli Clarke & Partners

A District tower designed by Pelli Clarke & Partners is now Japan's tallest building having topped out at 330 metres in April with a 2023 expected completion date.

However the mixed-use complex will likely not hold the title for long with Sou Fujimoto Architects and Mitsubishi Jisho Sekkei unveiling a design for a 390-metre tall tower for Tokyo in January 2021.

Jeddah Tower Jeddah Saudi Arabia by Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture

Ultra-high-rise specialist firm Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture's Jeddah Tower in Saudi Arabia has been touted as by far the world's tallest building with a planned height of at least 1000 metres ‚Äì easily surpassing the 828-metre-tall Burj Khalifa in Dubai.

But the project has been beset by multiple delays since construction began in 2013 and satellite images on Google Maps indicate little discernible progress at the site over the past three years.

The Line Saudi Arabian desert by Morphosis

Perhaps the world's most ambitious development project The Line is a 170-kilometre linear city planned as part of Neom in Saudi Arabia that would be comprised of two 500-metre-tall mirrored slabs running 200 metres apart.

Not everyone was convinced that the renders of the design recently produced by US studio Morphosis were sincere but in a world-first interview with Dezeen Neom director Tarek Qaddumi revealed that piling work has already begun and claimed that the first phase will complete in 2030.

Forma Toronto Canada by Frank Gehry

Canadian architect Frank Gehry has been working on plans for a pair of skyscrapers in his hometown of Toronto for nearly a decade. The tallest will stand at 308 metres.

Expected to complete in 2028 Forma's latest iteration will constitute two towers with offset blocks that stack on either side of voids and rippling glass-and-steel facades.

Nanjing Greenland Jinmao International Financial Center Nanjing China by SOM

Following a total ban on buildings above 500 metres issued in October 2021 at a planned 499.8 metres the under-construction Nanjing Greenland Jinmao International Financial Centre is as tall as new skyscrapers in China can get for the foreseeable future.

According to American architecture firm Skidmore Owings & Merrill (SOM) the tower's structural arches contribute to its structural efficiency while also evoking the curved gateways of Nanjing‚Äôs ancient city walls.

F Tower Abidjan Ivory Coast by Pierre Fakhoury and PFO Africa

F Tower designed for the Ivorian city of Abidjan by Lebanese-Ivorian architect Pierre Fakhoury and developer PFO Africa for the nation's government is gunning to become Africa's tallest tower.

Despite construction beginning in 2021 its final height has not been confirmed. Bloomberg previously reported that the building would be 283 metres but a recent article in Afrique Magazine claimed it will reach around to 400 metres.

Iconic Tower Cairo Egypt by Dar al-Handasah Shair & Partners

Also in competition to become Africa's tallest skyscraper is Iconic Tower which is currently nearing completion in the New Administrative Capital for Cairo with a reported height of 385 metres.

Designed by international firm Dar al-Handasah Shair & Partners the building will mostly house government offices.

Tower C Shenzhen China by Zaha Hadid Architects

London firm Zaha Hadid Architects designed a pair of connected towers for a new financial district in Shenzhen. Currently under construction they will be just shy of 400 metres tall when complete.

A multi-storey podium composed of sinuous terraces filled with greenery will link the two towers whose structures will be enclosed in a glass-curtain wall with a stepped finish intended to help shade the interiors.

September 03 2022 Chad Holloway PR & Media Manager

Dan Bilzerian may not be a GGPoker Ambassador anymore but the controversial playboy is still making headlines. The ‚ÄúKing of Instagram‚Äôs‚Äù most recent foray into the mainstream news isn‚Äôt poker related but rather concerns his cannabis company Ignite International Brands Ltd. which was launched in 2017 in Canada.

Following an inquiry by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) the United States Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have both launched their own investigations for accounting fraud. Back in May the SEC filed subpoenas in California seeking financial records related to the alleged fraud.

In July the company announced its intention to go from a publicly-traded company to a private entity which according to Business Wire was approved in a shareholder meeting at the end of August on the same day the SEC sought a court order forcing the company to turn over documents.

The press release read in part: ‚ÄúAt the Meeting shareholders of the Company approved: (i) the fixing of the number of directors of the Company at five (5); (ii) the election of the five nominated directors being Dan Bilzerian Lester Lee Greg Gilpin-Payne Ralph Gilpin-Payne and Tom Bunker.‚Äù

According to The Globe and Mail Bilzerian‚Äôs company which traded under ""BILZ-CN.‚Äù peaked in 2019 with a market capitalization of more than $750-million; however it had dropped to approximately $170 million when it stopped trading in North America.

In a court filing SEC staff attorney Patricia Pei alleged ‚Äúpossible violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws‚Äù and that uncovered information ‚Äúindicates [Ignite] may have filed public financial statements that include false or misleading representations‚Äù in 2020.

However this past week the SEC clarified by issuing a statement that it ‚Äúis continuing its fact-finding investigation and to date has not concluded that any individual or entity has violated the federal securities laws.‚Äù

Is Dan Bilzerian Destined to Take on an NFL Owner in $100M Game of Poker?

Bilzerian‚Äôs Time in the Limelight Continues

When it comes to poker Bilzerian has made the headlines ‚Äì both good and bad ‚Äì since December 2020. That is when it was announced he was joining GGPoker as an ambassador. His signing immediately ruffled feathers when he controversially called Vanessa Kade who was critical of his signing a ‚Äúhoe‚Äù on his first day on the job.

@VanessaKade @burrrrrberry Quiet hoe nobody knows who you are ‚Äî Dan Bilzerian (@DanBilzerian)

During the 2021 WSOP summer in the fall the rumor mill began churning that Bilzerian may play a $100000000 heads-up poker match but a month later he called out his supposed opponent billionaire Alec Gores for stalling on the match. Since then things have stagnated especially after Gores was linked to a possible acquisition of an NFL football team.

Bilzerian also released his book The Setup in 2021 (check out the PokerNews book review here) and in December sparred with Doug Polk on the latter‚Äôs podcast where the Upswing Poker founder grilled the Instagram icon over how he really made his money.

Bilzerian‚Äôs run as a poker ambassador came to a head back in June when he appeared on the No Jumper Podcast and revealed that he was no longer representing GGPoker.

Bilzerian sat down for an interview with Adam22 for a two-hour conversation. At around the 1:10:00 mark Bilzerian said some unflattering things about the poker community.

""Most poker players are f*****g nerds"" Bilzerian told Adam22 who is also a poker enthusiast. ""I don't really hangout with that many of them I don't really want to associate with them. I shut most of them out of my f*****g games. I never really let pros in.""

Bilzerian then went on to say that he's turned down numerous seven-figure offers to promote NFT's and other products such as poker sites but in the end ""I just won't sell out.""

The social media star said that GGPoker didn't hold up their end of the contract. He used an example of a freeroll tournament he went to Turks and Caicos to promote but the poker site didn't listen to his requests on how to promote the event he claims.

""Initially I tried to do it you know what I mean I did some posts and drove them a f******d of traffic"" Bilzerian claims. ""But then they were supposed to give me a percentage of the people that I recruited and you know we had like 100000 that we downloaded there's like a lot of people. So the numbers they were saying they were going to pay me was millions a month.""

Bilzerian then claimed that GGPoker wasn't paying him the affiliate revenue he expected.

""So we just agreed to kind of like end it you know"" Bilzerian said of the GGPoker relationship.

‚ÄúWhen I transplant seedlings they die out. The salt is still in the soil‚Äù said the farmer from Slab Ta Aon village a riverside settlement roughly 150 kilometers southwest of Cambodia‚Äôs capital Phnom Penh and 4 kilometers from the green mangrove-lined coast of Kampot province.

The farmer said that saltwater has destroyed rice paddies in Slab Ta Aon village for the past two years. Prak Nhorn 55 doubts that he and the other villagers will be able grow rice in the future.

Slab Ta Aon‚Äôs problem is no environmental fluke. It is an omen of a global environmental crisis that has been brewing for decades destabilizing food systems that feed millions.

Around the world saltwater is seeping further and further inland from the coasts tainting soils and fresh water with salt. A complicated interplay between groundwater extraction river damming for hydropower and riverbed mining is sinking shorelines as climate change raises the seas drawing seawater inland.

River deltas are especially vulnerable. Fan-shaped plains that form where rivers spill into the sea deltas often boast fertile soils thanks to nutrient-rich sediments delivered from upstream. Increasing salinity puts these special agricultural regions at risk.

The threat is perhaps most grave in Asia where vast ‚Äúmegadeltas‚Äù are vital for growing the continent‚Äôs staple crop ‚Äî rice. High salinity can make it impossible to grow rice.

‚ÄúYou really see a solid layer ‚Ä¶ a white layer on the soil from where saltwater was‚Äù said Bjoern Ole Sander of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). Rice plants growing in saline soil ‚Äúlook like straw‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúIf you touch them they‚Äôre hollow. There‚Äôs nothing.‚Äù

Food drinking water at risk

In Southeast Asia saltwater threatens rice paddies in the Mekong River and Red River deltas in Vietnam and the deltas of the Chao Phraya River in Thailand and the Ayeyarwady River in Myanmar.

In South Asia it degrades soils and taints drinking water in the densely populated Ganges‚ÄìBrahmaputra Delta of Bangladesh and India and the Indus Delta of Pakistan.

China‚Äôs Yangtze River Delta also faces rising salinity.

Beyond Asia saltwater intrusion affects the Nile Delta in Egypt and the Mississippi Delta in the United States ‚Äî both important agricultural regions.

For subsistence farmers like Prak Nhorn rising salinity directly threatens food security and access to drinking water. About 76% of Cambodians live in rural areas and many depend on natural resources for food. This makes many of the country‚Äôs 17.2 million inhabitants vulnerable to changes in the environment. Undernutrition rates in Cambodia hover around 15%.

Cambodian farmers have reported issues with salinity for years and ‚Äúthere is saltwater intrusion‚Äù in the country said Hak Mao director of Cambodia‚Äôs Climate Change Department at the Ministry of Environment. But ‚Äúlimited technical capacity‚Äù means the true extent of the problem in Cambodia is not known he said.

In neighboring Vietnam however the costs of saltwater intrusion have been clear for decades.

‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs fresh water we can grow rice all year round‚Äù said farmer Khau Van Ngoan of Vietnam‚Äôs Long An province. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs none nothing can be grown.‚Äù

Vietnam grows more than half of its rice in one region ‚Äî the Mekong River Delta.

There salinity has ‚Äúreally been on the rise‚Äù said hydrologist Gijs Simons of FutureWater a consultancy that uses satellite data to assess salinity for the Mekong River Commission (MCR). The area affected by severe salinity which makes it nearly impossible to grow rice has roughly ‚Äúdoubled since the '90s or even almost tripled for some years‚Äù he said.

In the past saltwater would seep about 30-50 kilometers inland. Now it can reach areas more than 100 kilometers inward from the coast said hydrologist Binh Doan Van of the Vietnamese-German University who studies saltwater intrusions in the Mekong River Delta. One particularly severe salinity intrusion in 2016 affected 270000 hectares of rice said Andrew Wyatt who oversees projects in Southeast Asia for the environmental organization International Union for Conservation of Nature or IUCN. The damage totaled an estimated $455 million or 1.5% percent of Vietnam‚Äôs annual rice yield.

Shrimp alternative

But it‚Äôs possible to see rising salinity as an opportunity rather than a disaster.

Rice can‚Äôt tolerate salty water but shrimp can ‚Äî and shrimp fetch a better price than the rice Vietnam produces for export to low- and middle-income countries.

‚ÄúShrimp is better business than rice. It‚Äôs more lucrative‚Äù said Dang Thi Vich a shrimp farmer from Ben Tre province.

Some farmers in the Mekong River Delta took advantage of this as salinity rose growing shrimp instead of rice during the dry season when conditions are most saline. The Vietnamese government and NGOs later launched programs to help more farmers adopt this rice-shrimp rotation system.

‚ÄúShrimp farming began about some 20 years ago and it‚Äôs become very popular‚Äù said Vich. ‚ÄúEveryone grew rice before that.‚Äù

Things are changing fast. In 2018 15% of farmers in the delta gave up rice farming for something else usually shrimp farming said Bradford Mills an economist at Virginia Tech who studied the switch. The next year another 10% stopped growing rice. Simons noted that the shift from rice paddies to shrimp ponds is visible in his satellite data.

Experts say the Vietnamese government plans to scale back rice farming and diversify the Mekong River Delta‚Äôs economy. This will mean upping shrimp and other aquaculture along the coast and growing ‚Äúhigh quality‚Äù rice for export to rich countries. This diversification ‚Äúis in line with Vietnam's move from a low-income country to a middle-low-income country‚Äù said Wyatt.

But researchers have expressed concerns that adaptions to rising salinity in Vietnam are coming at a social cost widening the gap between rich and poor.

‚ÄúFor the country scale [shrimp farming] may be good‚Äù said Binh. ‚ÄúBut for [the] local scale for individuals that's I think [it] still has some problems.‚Äù

Ben Tre province farmer Nguyen Thi Be Lieu said she tried shrimp farming a couple of years ago ‚Äúbut business didn‚Äôt take off. We spent more than we earned so we stopped.‚Äù

Switching from rice to shrimp aquaculture is risky. Not everyone can afford to. Those who can‚Äôt ‚Äî and who don‚Äôt receive aid ‚Äî can have no choice but to sell or lease their land and migrate to find work.

There‚Äôs also evidence that shrimp aquaculture isn‚Äôt always environmentally sustainable. While Wyatt noted that rice-shrimp rotation is more sustainable than farming rice or shrimp exclusively for lands at the mouth of the Mekong it isn‚Äôt a good solution everywhere it is being adopted. If there‚Äôs not enough freshwater flow from upstream dry-season shrimp ponds can leave salt in the soil which over time makes it hard to grow rice at all in the wet season. Ponds can get so salty that even shrimp can‚Äôt survive.

‚ÄúSaline soil is bad for business even shrimp farming‚Äù said Long An province farmer Pham Van Bay. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs absolutely nothing you can do with saline soil.‚Äù

Aquaculture can also pollute waterways a problem Binh says should be managed to ensure that it stays sustainable and profitable for the future.

Still if these challenges can be overcome sating wealthy countries‚Äô appetites for shrimp and high-quality rice could pay off for many farmers and the Vietnamese economy as a whole said Binh and Wyatt.

‚ÄòHow can we have rice to eat?‚Äô

The question said Sander ‚Äúis of course: where do you produce the rice instead? Because demand is still there. And shrimp cannot replace rice on people's plates.‚Äù

Vietnam is the third-biggest rice exporter worldwide and more than 90% of its exports come from the Mekong River Delta. Countries that are ‚Äúbig rice importers ‚Ä¶ are hit also by climate change impacts and salinity impacts in the Mekong Delta‚Äù said Sander. For instance the Philippines imports nearly 80% of its rice from Vietnam.

Demand for rice is increasing as the world population grows. IRRI estimates that rice production globally needs to increase by 1% to 1.2% every year to keep rice prices low enough to be affordable for billions of people who depend on the grain.

For the Mekong River Delta Binh said that adapting to rising salinity involves a combination of pricey infrastructure to keep saltwater out ‚Äî which can come with its own environmental problems ‚Äî and changes to how people live and work like adopting rice-shrimp systems. Other agricultural deltas face similar choices.

Countries that import a lot of rice from salinity-affected regions will need to find new sources to meet their growing demand for rice or consumers will simply pay more for it. Many farmers will need to adapt. And some will just need to find a way to survive.

Suos Sovann lives just a stone‚Äôs throw away from Prak Nhorn‚Äôs farm in Slab Ta Aon village. She is a rice farmer ‚Äî or was. Saltwater now floods her 7000-square-meter farm every year making her soil infertile.

Unable to grow rice for herself and her family Suos Sovann now depends on money sent by two of her children who work in a nearby garment factory. Combined they send her about $50 every month. She will spend $30 of it on rice.

She wonders if perhaps her children could send more money but she doesn‚Äôt dare ask. There‚Äôs nothing to do but bear with it she says.

""If we don‚Äôt farm"" asked Suos Sovann ""how can we have rice to eat?‚Äù

INJURY PRONE Phil Jones has been kicked out of Manchester United‚Äôs training ground dressing room - to make space for Erik ten Hag‚Äôs new signings.

The first team changing room at United‚Äôs AON training Centre at Carrington is only meant for a maximum 24 players and is bursting to capacity after Ten Hag‚Äôs summer spending spree.

And that‚Äôs left stars like Jones and third choice left back Brandon Williams on loan at Norwich last season being shunted down the corridor to the Under-23 changing room.

Joining them are believed to be defenders Teden Mengi and Axel Tuanzebe as well as promising midfielder Shola Shoretire.

The arrival of Real Madrid‚Äôs Brazilian midfielder Casemiro Ajax winger Antony Argentinian defender Lisandro Martinez left back Tyrell Malacia and back-up keeper Martin Dubravka has squeezed space at Carrington.

It‚Äôs the latest blow for hapless Jones and another twist in his bizarre United career that had hit the buffers even before he signed a four-year ¬£110000-week contract in February 2019.

The 30-year-old former England defender has played only 13 games in four seasons and his last appearance came in January in a 1-0 defeat by Wolves - his first match in two years.

United fans are astonished the former Blackburn defender is even still at Old Trafford after the transfer window closed on Thursday.

But it‚Äôs believed Jones in the final year of his contract is nursing another injury and was unable to be sold in the latest window.

United have given up on recovering a fee for the defender who was once described by Sir Bobby Charlton as reminding him of the great Duncan Edwards.

Former England boss Fabio Capello also lauded Jones comparing him to legendary Italian defender Franco Baresi.

And Sir Alex Ferguson once predicted he could become United's best-ever player.

Injuries prevented Jones fulfilling his promise and he‚Äôs now marking time with United hoping they can off-load him in January.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9mb290YmFsbC9uZXdzL21hbmNoZXN0ZXItdW5pdGVkLXNxdWFkLXRyYW5zZmVycy1qb25lcy0yNzkwMzQ3MNIBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9mb290YmFsbC9uZXdzL21hbmNoZXN0ZXItdW5pdGVkLXNxdWFkLXRyYW5zZmVycy1qb25lcy0yNzkwMzQ3MC5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Erik ten Hag brutally axes five Man Utd stars from dressing room including Phil Jones,"Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag has been forced to take drastic measures to make room for the club's new recruits at their Carrington training base

Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag has reportedly axed Phil Jones and four other players from the club's first-team dressing room in order to accommodate new signings.

Although United endured a slow start to the transfer window Dutchman Ten Hag was backed with significant funds in a bid to overhaul a squad that slumped to United's worst-ever finish in the Premier League last term.

Tyrell Malacia Christian Eriksen Lisandro Martinez Casemiro Antony and Martin Dubravka have all arrived at Old Trafford over the summer for a combined sum of around ¬£220million - the largest amount Manchester United have ever spent in a single transfer window.

The influx of new arrivals has left United's first-team dressing room at their Carrington base at breaking point. And according to The Sun the AON Training Centre's first-team changing room is only able to accommodate a maximum of 24 players... meaning the club have been forced to a shunt a number of fringe players into the U23's changing area.

Jones is the biggest name to have been culled by Ten Hag in order to make room for the club's new recruits the England international still at Old Trafford despite seeing his career wrecked by injury.

Brandon Williams who spent last year on loan at Norwich City has also been sacrificed. Defenders Axel Tuanzebe and Tegen Mendi are two other players to have been moved along with young midfielder Shola Shoretire.

Ten Hag's decision is the latest blow for Jones who was expected to leave this summer. Williams and Tuanzebe were also available for transfer in the window however Ten Hag was reluctant to lose the trio in the wake of injuries which scuppered their chances of securing moves.

Jones has only made a handful of senior appearances after being plagued by injuries over the past four years. His last match for United was in the 1-0 defeat against Wolves back in January - his first appearance in two years.

Williams is unlikely to be handed a reprieve anytime soon following the positive impression that Malacia has made to life at Old Trafford while Tuanzebe and Jones have dropped even further down the pecking order after the arrival of Martinez who has struck up an instant understanding with Raphael Varane.

Malacia and Martinez have already taken the places of Luke Shaw and Haryr Maguire in Ten Hag's first-choice XI and both are set to start against Arsenal on Sunday with Eriksen expected to continue in midfield. Big money Brazilian duo Casemiro and Antony are both yet to make their first starts for the club with the ¬£85million Ajax star having only joined this week.",,,,,,

Reportedly several old iphones could be killed off. However Apple has not made any official announcement in regards to the discontinuation of the previous iPhone models.

According to the reports Apple may ditch the older iPhones especially iPhone 11 after the iPhone 14 launch. The American tech giant tends to follow this norm to ensure sales of new models are not affected.

Here is a list of iPhone models whose existence has been put in doubt ahead of the launch of iPhone 14.

iPhone 11

As per the reports from iDropNews Apply may drop the iPhone 11 as it takes the sale of new iPhone SE 3 away. Additionally iPhone 11 does not support 5G. The claim has been echoed by a Tom‚Äôs guide report that says ‚ÄúApply also rarely keeps phones longer than three years after their release date. The iPhone 11 unveiled in September 2019 is rapidly approaching its Sell-By date so it is a pretty safe bet that it is getting cycled out of the lineup this fall.""

iPhone 12 mini

Apple is believed to avoid the iPhone 14 mini in favour of the new large iPhone 14 Max or Plus as the mini version previously failed to deliver as per the company‚Äôs expectations on terms of sales. While keeping it in mind Apple may discontinue the iPhone 12 mini too.

iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max

While analysing the earlier patterns of Apple it is assumed that the tech giant may kill off the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max. Significantly since the beginning of the Pro and Pro Max models back in 2019 Apple has never kept any of its Pro versions for more than a year. Additionally the latest iPhone 14 is expected to get the same iphone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max‚Äôs chipset.

Meanwhile as the much-awaited Apple launch event is likely to take place soon several rumours about the upcoming iPhone 14 line-up phones have been making rounds and the latest one suggests that Pro models will revive the classic iOS battery percentage indicator.

The endoscope is an imaging device consisting of a camera and a light guide attached to a long flexible tube. It is particularly useful for acquiring images of the inside of a human body. For example stomach and colon endoscopy are widely used for the early detection and diagnosis of diseases such as ulcers and cancers.

In general an endoscope is manufactured by attaching a camera sensor to the end of a probe or using an optical fiber which allows for information to be transmitted using light. In the case of an endoscope that uses a camera sensor the thickness of the probe increases which makes the endoscopy rather invasive. In the case of an endoscope using an optical fiber bundle it can be manufactured in a thinner form factor which minimizes invasiveness and results in much less discomfort to the patients.

However the downside is that in a conventional fiber-bundle endoscope it is difficult to perform high-resolution imaging because the resolution of the obtained image is limited by the size of the individual fiber cores. Much of the image information is also lost due to reflection from the probe tip. Furthermore in fiber endoscopy it is often necessary to label the target with fluorescence especially in biological samples with low reflectivity due to strong back-reflection noise generated from the tip of the thin probe.

Recently a research team led by CHOI Wonshik the Associate Director of the Center for Molecular Spectroscopy and Dynamics (CMSD) within the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) has developed a high-resolution holographic endoscope system. The researchers were able to overcome the previous limitation of fiber optic endoscopy and were able to reconstruct high-resolution images without attaching a lens or any equipment to the distal end of the fiber bundle.

This feat was accomplished by measuring the holographic images of the light waves that are reflected from the object and captured by the fiber bundle. The researchers first illuminated an object by focusing light onto a single core of a fiber bundle and measured holographic images that were reflected from the object at a certain distance from the optical fiber. In the process of analyzing the holographic images it was possible to reconstruct the object image with a microscopic resolution by correcting the phase retardation that occurs by each fiber core. Specifically a unique coherent image optimization algorithm was developed to eliminate fiber-induced phase retardations in both the illumination and detection pathways and reconstruct an object image with a microscopic resolution.

Since the developed endoscope does not attach any equipment to the end of the optical fiber the diameter of the endoscope probe is 350 Œºm which is thinner than the needle used for hypodermic injection. Using this approach researchers were able to obtain high-resolution images with a spatial resolution of 850 nm which is far smaller than the core size of the optical fiber bundle.

The researchers went on to test the new Fourier holographic endoscopy system to image the villi structure of mice. It was possible to acquire high contrast image by effectively removing the back-reflection noise of the probe even in biological samples with very low reflectivity such as rat villi. In addition post-processing of the measured holographic information made it possible to reconstruct multi-depth 3D images from a single data set with a depth resolution of 14 Œºm.

It is believed that the practical application of this new endoscope will greatly improve the way we can image the internal structures of our body in a minimally invasive manner with little to no discomfort for patients. It will also open the possibility of directly observing cavities as small as microvessels and the smallest airways in the lungs which was impossible with preexisting technologies. The researchers even suggested the application of their new endoscope can go well beyond the medical field as it can potentially be useful for industrial inspections of semiconductors and microprocessors.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

n maillon grippe et toute la cha√Æne peut d√©faillir voire d√©railler. Dans celle des soins les soci√©t√©s d‚Äôambulances priv√©es sont l‚Äôun de ces maillons assurant une jonction essentielle. √Ä partir du 1er octobre elles tiendront un r√¥le encore √©largi dans le dispositif m√™me de transport des urgences pr√©-hospitali√®res. Le transport sanitaire priv√© √©tait d√©j√† tenu d‚Äôassurer 12 heures de garde la nuit. √Ä compter du 1er octobre dans chacun des neuf secteurs d√©coupant la Charente-Maritime un √©quipage de deux ambulanciers devra √™tre en mesure de r√©pondre aux sollicitations du centre 15 la r√©gulation m√©dicale d‚Äôurgence ¬´ H24 ¬ª.

Sur le m√™me sujet Gironde : le centre 15 en souffrance face au d√©fi de la r√©gulation des urgences Depuis le mois de mai dernier la direction du CHU de Bordeaux a r√©gul√© ses urgences adultes mesure dupliqu√©e par toutes les urgences de la Gironde. En d√©but de ligne le Centre 15 s‚Äôessouffle

Pas une question d‚Äôargent

Le hic c‚Äôest que l‚Äôentr√©e en vigueur de ces gardes √©largies survient en Charente-Maritime en tout cas plusieurs ann√©es apr√®s la conclusion de l‚Äôaccord. Entretemps bien des param√®tres ont chang√©. Le co√ªt des carburants a bondi notamment. ¬´ La compensation d‚Äôune garde de 12 heures pour la mobilisation d‚Äôun √©quipage de deux personnes √©tait de 346 euros. En passant sur un syst√®me de garde H24 l‚Äôheure sera r√©tribu√©e 64 euros ce qui couvre √† peine les frais ¬ª analyse Bernard Fauconnet longtemps pr√©sident de l‚Äôassociation des transports sanitaires urgents en Charente-Maritime avant d‚Äôen confier les cl√©s √† son homologue rochelaise Magalie Gerbaut.

Ne pas y lire une remise en question de l‚Äôaccord accept√© avec l‚Äô√âtat. ¬´ Il a fallu aux entreprises priv√©es de transport sanitaire du d√©partement trouver les mod√®les d‚Äôorganisation jongler de mani√®re serr√©e mais toutes les entreprises vont remplir cette mission sans se pr√©occuper d‚Äô√©quilibre financier ¬ª promet Bernard Fauconnet de tout temps investi dans la d√©fense de sa corporation jusqu‚Äô√† exercer un temps la vice-pr√©sidence du syndicat national.

Effectifs en berne

L‚Äôinqui√©tude actuelle des professionnels tient davantage √† la bonne compr√©hension de leurs difficult√©s par leurs clients. Certes pour ces derniers le service rendu est financi√®rement indolore en surface puisque pris en charge par l‚ÄôAssurance-maladie. ¬´ Mais certains regrettent parfois par exemple de ne pas b√©n√©ficier d‚Äôun transport individuel pour √™tre conduit √† un rendez-vous m√©dical. Pr√©cisons d√©j√† que le transport group√© assis est autoris√© mais surtout pour nous professionnels c‚Äôest parfois une n√©cessit√© pour pouvoir r√©pondre √† la demande. ¬ª

¬´ Notre profession a enregistr√© des d√©missions et rencontre des difficult√©s de recrutement ¬ª

Un autre param√®tre a sensiblement √©volu√© depuis qu‚Äô√âtat et ambulanciers priv√©s ont convenu d‚Äôune garde sur la journ√©e enti√®re. ¬´ La crise Covid est pass√©e par l√† et notre profession comme bien d‚Äôautres a enregistr√© des d√©missions et rencontre des difficult√©s de recrutement. ¬ª Bernard Fauconnet illustre son propos par le cas de l‚Äôentreprise qu‚Äôil a lui-m√™me cr√©√© √† Cozes pr√®s de Royan en 1980 dont son fils assure aujourd‚Äôhui la direction. ¬´ Avec un effectif de 50 salari√©s dont une trentaine de roulants on peut rapidement se retrouver avec une dizaine d‚Äôabsents. ¬ª Le probl√®me peut vite devenir aigu avec le doublement des gardes pour les urgences pr√©-hospitali√®res √† partir du 1er octobre.

Ne pas voir que les contraintes

Le site de P√¥le emploi fait √©tat de 245 offres de postes d‚Äôambulancier (√®res) s et d‚Äôauxiliaires ambulancier (√®re) s ou propositions de contrat d‚Äôapprentissage. ¬´ Et on re√ßoit peu voire pas de r√©ponses ¬ª se d√©sole Bernard Fauconnet. ¬´ √Ä croire que les gens ne veulent plus s‚Äôengager. Ce m√©tier est pourtant porteur de valeurs humaines. Je comprends que la question du salaire soit importante mais d√©j√† nos ressources √©tant encadr√©es par les remboursements de l‚ÄôAssurance-maladie les marges sont extr√™mement serr√©es nous ne pouvons pas augmenter substantiellement les salaires. Mais peut-√™tre faut-il arr√™ter de ne consid√©rer un m√©tier que sous l‚Äôangle des contraintes. Il faut peut-√™tre voir aussi l‚Äôimportance du r√¥le qu‚Äôon joue dans le parcours de soins d‚Äôun patient l‚Äôaccompagnement qu‚Äôon lui apporte √† notre niveau la relation humaine qu‚Äôon noue avec lui ¬ª tente de plaider Bernard Fauconnet.

La cons√©quence de ces effectifs sur le fil ? ¬´ On refuse quotidiennement des missions de transport assis. Mon souci c‚Äôest de faire entendre aux clients cette r√©alit√©. Nous ne le faisons pas pour une raison √©conomique mais parce que la profession manque de personnel. Avec des salari√©s en nombre suffisant nous pourrions mieux g√©rer l‚Äôemploi de nos v√©hicules. Bon si les heures de sortie dans les √©tablissements de soins √©taient aussi mieux respect√©es si les rendez-vous √©taient assur√©s √† l‚Äôheure √©galement‚Ä¶ ¬ª Un autre d√©bat bien qu‚Äôil participe d‚Äôune grande planification plus harmonieuse en constante am√©lioration nuance Bernard Fauconnet. Les mois et ann√©es n‚Äôen seront pas plus faciles √† aborder pour ce maillon de plus en plus important que repr√©sente le transport sanitaire priv√©.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZm10di5jb20vaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9sLXVrcmFpbmUtcmVjb25uYWl0LWF2b2lyLWZyYXBwZS11bmUtYmFzZS1ydXNzZS1wcmVzLWRlLWxhLWNlbnRyYWxlLWRlLXphcG9yaWppYV9BRC0yMDIyMDkwMzAwNzUuaHRtbNIBjQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZm10di5jb20vYW1wL2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvbC11a3JhaW5lLXJlY29ubmFpdC1hdm9pci1mcmFwcGUtdW5lLWJhc2UtcnVzc2UtcHJlcy1kZS1sYS1jZW50cmFsZS1kZS16YXBvcmlqaWFfQUQtMjAyMjA5MDMwMDc1Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,L'Ukraine reconna√Æt avoir frapp√© une base russe pr√®s de la centrale de Zaporijia,"Vendredi livrant le bilan quotidien de ses op√©rations l'arm√©e ukrainienne a indiqu√© avoir frapp√© la base russe d'Energodar pr√®s de Zaporijia assurant y avoir d√©truit trois syst√®mes d'artillerie un d√©p√¥t de munitions mais aussi avoir tu√© des soldats.

L'Ukraine a indiqu√© vendredi avoir frapp√© une base russe √† Energodar dans le sud du pays non loin de la centrale nucl√©aire de Zaporijia d'o√π elle accuse la Russie d'avoir retir√© ses armements avant son inspection par une √©quipe de l'Agence internationale de l'√©nergie atomique (AIEA).

L'Ukraine dresse le bilan de ses frappes sur Energodar

Dans le m√™me temps alors que les pays du G7 visaient la manne √©nerg√©tique de la Russie en convenant de plafonner le prix de son p√©trole Moscou a fait trembler les Europ√©ens en annon√ßant que le gazoduc Nord Stream serait totalement arr√™t√© jusqu'√† la r√©paration d'une turbine un motif jug√© fallacieux par l'Allemagne hautement d√©pendante du gaz russe.

""Dans les localit√©s de Kherson et d'Energodar des frappes pr√©cises de nos troupes ont d√©truit trois syst√®mes d'artillerie de l'ennemi ainsi qu'un d√©p√¥t de munitions"" tuant nombre de militaires russes a affirm√© l'arm√©e ukrainienne dans son point d'information quotidien.

Accusations mutuelles

L'arm√©e ukrainienne a par ailleurs affirm√© que les forces russes avaient √©vacu√© ""tout leur √©quipement militaire depuis le site de la centrale"" avant l'arriv√©e jeudi de la mission de l'AIEA dont plusieurs membres sont rest√©es √† la centrale et s'y trouvent toujours. La centrale de Zaporijia la plus grande d'Europe est tomb√©e aux mains des troupes russes en mars peu apr√®s le lancement par Moscou de son invasion de l'Ukraine et son site a √©t√© vis√© par plusieurs bombardements faisant craindre une catastrophe nucl√©aire. Kiev et Moscou se rejettent la responsabilit√© de ces frappes.

Jeudi matin avant l'arriv√©e de la mission de l'AIEA les autorit√©s ukrainiennes avaient accus√© les Russes d'avoir eux-m√™mes bombard√© Energodar une ville qu'ils contr√¥lent avec l'intention d'en rejeter la responsabilit√© sur Kiev.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vaW52ZXN0aXIubGVzZWNob3MuZnIvbWFyY2hlcy1pbmRpY2VzL29waW5pb25zL2xlLW1hZG9mZi1kZS1sYS1zbmVha2VyLWF1cmFpdC1lc2Nyb3F1ZS04NS1taWxsaW9ucy1kZS1kb2xsYXJzLTE4NjE4NjTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Le Madoff de la sneaker aurait escroqu√© 85 millions de dollars,"Par No√©mie Helvig

Arnaque. Cotation en direct et historique des transactions : on se croirait √† la Bourse de Paris sur le site du revendeur de sneakers StockX. Depuis quelques ann√©es les baskets sont devenues un v√©ritable objet de sp√©culation. Certains mod√®les s'√©changent √† prix d'or √† l'instar de la vente record au printemps 2021 d'une paire de Nike Air Yeezy 1 port√©e par le rappeur Kanye West pour la modique somme de 18 million de dollars. Un march√© fructueux qui a donn√© la folie des grandeurs √† Michael Malekzadeh rattrap√© en ao√ªt par la justice am√©ricaine.

D√©j√† surnomm√© ¬´ le Madoff de la sneaker ¬ª ce natif de l'Oregon aurait mont√© une pyramide de Ponzi au travers de son site Zadeh Kicks. Selon les procureurs f√©d√©raux il collectait l'argent de ses clients en leur assurant qu'il leur fournirait moyennant un paiement √† l'avance des paires de sneakers rares dans un d√©lai de trois √† six mois apr√®s leurs sorties d'usines. L'escroc pr√©sum√© achetait en r√©alit√© les mod√®les sur des sites de revente classique dans des quantit√©s bien inf√©rieures √† celles promises. Les heureux √©lus qui recevaient leurs commandes les revendaient en r√©alisant une plus-value et ceux priv√©s de marchandises √©taient rembours√©s en cartes cadeaux gr√¢ce √† l'argent des nouveaux clients.

Le syst√®me s'est effondr√© au coup de trop : Malekzadeh avait enregistr√© 600.000 commandes d'une paire d'Air Jordan en √©dition limit√©e mais ne poss√©dait que 1 % du stock. Les d√©fauts de paiement s'accumulant l'homme de 39 ans a √©t√© contraint de se d√©clarer insolvable. Il a √©t√© inculp√© de trois chefs d'accusation recouvrant une escroquerie de 85 millions de dollars : 70 millions pour les pertes des particuliers et 15 millions pour celles des institutions financi√®res aupr√®s desquelles il est endett√©. Une somme de 64 millions de dollars a d√©j√† √©t√© r√©colt√©e par la justice am√©ricaine gr√¢ce √† la vente d'une partie de ses effets personnels et pr√®s de 60.000 paires de sneakers saisies ont √©t√© mises sur le march√©. Le suspect risque jusqu'√† trente ans de prison et a plaid√© non coupable."

The iHeart Radio host dissed the Kansas City Chiefs tight end for his drinking habits and claimed he's ""always drunk."" Now Kelce is hitting back via multiple insiders.

""He was taken aback as he‚Äôs never met her and is just living his life"" the source told Page Six while ""emphatically"" denying any suggestion the athlete has a drinking problem. ""That guy is under a microscope basically being watched everywhere he goes. Of course you're going to see him drinking"" the source said.

Kramer even took aim at Kelce's influence on his girlfriend Taylor Swift arguing that he has encouraged the singer's consumption habits.

""I see her drinking more now. Like the company you keep"" Kramer alleged while also calling Kelce out for his ""aggression"" with coach Andy Reid during the Super Bowl. It ""rubbed [her] the wrong way.""

The same insider went on to argue that if Kelce did have a drinking problem it would be impossible to hide given his status and constant

""It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs passed out somewhere. If he was passed out somewhere I would totally understand but that‚Äôs not the case whatsoever"" the source adds while noting that he's just a ""normal human being"" who is ""doing the same thing"" as everyone else...only ""in the public eye.""

The three-time Super Bowl champ is reportedly ""in training right now"" to prepare for another season with the Chiefs. ""If he was drunk it would be a bigger problem"" the source said.

This isn't the first time Kelce has come under fire for drinking. During his honorary graduation ceremony for his ""New Heights"" podcast Travis accepted the diploma he never picked up in the first place before chugging a beer in celebration. However big brother Jason was quick to his defense.

""I know it looks like a graduation from the video but this was actually at the end of a New Heights Live podcast that we put on to raise money for the University‚Äôs NIL"" the older Kelce said according to People Magazine. ""The university did this to poke fun at my brother and I for never really picking up our diplomas.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d0b3AuY29tL2RjLzIwMjQvMDUvcG9saWNlLWluc3RhbGwtZmVuY2luZy1hcm91bmQtZm9ybWVyLWd3LWVuY2FtcG1lbnQtc2F5LTExLW9mLTMzLWFycmVzdGVkLWlkZW50aWZpZWQtdGhlbXNlbHZlcy1hcy1zdHVkZW50cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pro-Palestinian protesters disperse after police presence at GWU campus; at least 1 arrested,"A groups of around 100 protesters linked arms and encircled several tents.

Pro-Palestinian protesters returned to the George Washington University and pitched tents on campus Thursday night just one day after police cleared an encampment on the D.C. campus arresting dozens of people.

A group of around 100 pro-Palestinian protesters linked arms and encircled several tents along F Street in Foggy Bottom on Thursday night. Demonstrators chanted for around five hours at times in heavy rain.

Around 11:30 p.m. D.C. police gave its first warning to the demonstrators to disperse from the area or face arrests for unlawful entry and trespassing on campus property. Many protesters could be seen collecting their signs and packing up tents and leaving the area.

After the sixth warning MPD officers linked arms and began advancing on the protesters until 19th and F streets according to 7News‚Äô Christian Flores who was on the scene and told WTOP. He said many of the organizers and protesters decided to leave on their own.

‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt seen any [response from university officials] late this evening. It is pretty calm‚Äù Flores said as protestors were leaving the area of the university. ‚ÄúSo it does appear that there was a plan in place by MPD to not only disperse the protesters but also to make sure there wasn‚Äôt any sort of second gathering after that dispersal order.‚Äù

Police confirmed to WTOP that one arrest was made for assault on an officer.

As the campus encampment approached the two-week mark Wednesday D.C. police broke up the gathering and arrested 33 pro-Palestinian demonstrators. Six of those arrested are current students the university said in a statement Thursday.

After that clearing of the tents dozens of protesters came back to campus and gathered at the intersection of 21st and H Street early Thursday evening before marching to F Street at around 8 p.m.

Seemingly peaceful

The group carried signs that read ‚ÄúWe are not leaving‚Äù and chanted ‚ÄúFree free Palestine.‚Äù Marchers paused in front of the residence that‚Äôs traditionally occupied by the university‚Äôs president Ellen Granberg and chanted outside the home.

Then they marched down F Street where several administrative offices are also located ‚Äî including Granberg‚Äôs office.

That‚Äôs where protesters put up nine tents the university‚Äôs student newspaper The Hatchet reported. Some participants also climbed the brick entrance to a university building nearby the tents.

WTOP's Scott Gelman reports from George Washington University as pro-Palestinian protesters return to campus.

Dozens of D.C. police officers some on bikes gathered on F Street and the surrounding area.

WTOP‚Äôs Scott Gelman reported a brief moment of pushing and shoving earlier in the evening when police on bicycles appeared to be attempting to control a sidewalk in front of a university building.

Outside of that scuffle the protest appeared to have remained peaceful.

WTOP has reached out to the university for comment. D.C. police told WTOP the department is monitoring the First Amendment activity.

Protesters are back. Here‚Äôs how students are reacting

Among those in the crowd on H Street was GW student Reem Lababdi who told WTOP she was pepper sprayed in the back by D.C. police but not arrested Wednesday.

‚ÄúWe said we weren‚Äôt leaving and we meant it‚Äù Lababdi said in reference to the encampment. ‚ÄúWe will not be pushed aside when our administration is funding the genocide of our people.‚Äù

Students from other nearby colleges including American University George Mason and the University of Maryland took part in the protests on GW‚Äôs campus.

Lababdi said protesters are there to send a message to Mayor Muriel Bowser congressional lawmakers and Granberg whom she criticized for allegedly declining to meet with student protesters.

‚ÄúShe would sooner brutalize her own students than come to the negotiating table with them‚Äù Lababdi said.

But there‚Äôs division among GW students about the protests.

David Delarosa a GW student told WTOP he encountered protesters on H Street while returning home from work Thursday.

‚ÄúWe have students here who just want to go to work want to go finish their finals go home enjoy their summer‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ridiculous.‚Äù

Protest organizers have called accusations that the demonstrations are antisemitic ‚Äúbaseless.‚Äù But some Jewish students have said they feel intimidated by the protests.

‚ÄúJews like myself feel threatened they feel scared and we just want to live our lives‚Äù he said.

Barriers around site of former encampment

The events Thursday come after fencing was installed around the GW‚Äôs University Yard. The fence barriers standing over 10 feet tall resemble those put in place around the Capitol building after the Jan. 6 2021 insurrection ‚Äî and are now blocking all entrances of University Yard.

It is unclear how long the fences are expected to remain around the area.

When asked at a Wednesday news conference whether the encampment clearing meant there would be no more protests on GW‚Äôs campus D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith said it was Granberg‚Äôs decision ‚Äúto determine if she will allow protests in other areas of the campus.‚Äù

Smith said that no protests will take place in the now-secured area.

Smith said there were many indicators that the protests were becoming more volatile outlining intelligence that officers had been collecting over the days leading up to Wednesday. One of the concerning indicators Smith mentioned was that non-students were joining the protests on campus and had been found in secure campus buildings.

Granberg also said in a statement over the weekend that the protest had ‚Äúbeen co-opted by individuals who are largely unaffiliated with our community and do not have our community‚Äôs best interest in mind.‚Äù

Arrest records show that the 33 arrested protesters ranged in age from 18 to 33 years old.

Tensions have continued to ratchet up in standoffs with protesters on campuses across the U.S. ‚Äî and increasingly in Europe ‚Äî nearly three weeks into a movement launched by a protest at Columbia University in New York.

Some colleges cracked down immediately on protests against the Israel-Hamas war. Among those that have tolerated the tent encampments some universities have begun to lose patience and call in police over concerns about disruptions to campus life safety and the involvement of nonstudents.

Since April 18 just over 2600 people have been arrested on 50 campuses according to figures based on reporting by The Associated Press and statements from universities and law enforcement agencies.

Businesses whether big or small know that understanding data is essential to making informed decisions that impact the organization‚Äôs bottom line. The emergence of new data from embedded devices mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) is accelerating and complicating insights. Here‚Äôs what Statista said in the recent reports ‚ÄúIn 2021 it was projected that the overall amount of data created worldwide would reach 79 zettabytes and would more than double by 2025 with no end in sight.‚Äù (Reference as illustrated below)

Image Source: https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/

The same report also states the factors contributing to the rapid growth of data traffic. ‚ÄúIt is the Internet of Things (IoT) which already connects the digital and physical worlds through a network of sensors. The data volume created by global IoT connections reached 13.6 zettabytes in 2019 and is forecast to amount to over 79 zettabytes by 2025.‚Äù

Apart from this the proliferation of business intelligence tools growing diversity of machine and human-generated data Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning Blockchain etc. are opening

more ways for information management and interpretation. But accessing this data poses a challenge for many organizations.

Harnessing data for informed decision-making gets difficult especially when reporting and utilities are across multiple vendors or paper-based. As a result manual data entry and collection limits an organization‚Äôs ability to understand its data usage on a granular level. Advanced technological solutions address such challenges effectively; however several companies have been slow to adapt their workflows and processes to take advantage of more scalable data collection options.

Confronting Data Collection Challenges with Automation

Though data-driven decision-making is crucial for creating values and driving businesses in the right direction it needs a mix of capabilities and actions‚Äîsome technical some not. Automated data collection solutions combine human intelligence with RPA AI and ML. Whether proprietary or public data organizations can transform their raw unstructured data into tagged and schema-compliant XML fit for data products analytics AI/ML applications etc.

Listed here are the leading-edge tools and software for data capture and collection processes:

‚óè Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

One of the well-established and proven technologies is Optical Character Recognition. Even after disrupting the traditional approach to document management once this technology remains as relevant as ever.

It is perfect for digitizing huge piles of electronic and paper documents and is widely used across healthcare logistics banking finance governing and more. Multipurpose OCR systems not only reduce the costs of capturing data but also help in automating routine manual tasks. This helps in freeing human resources from doing mundane repetitive tasks. In short the OCR solution is a prerequisite for cost-efficient document management.

‚óè Optical Mark Recognition (OMR)

Optical Mark Recognition is another approach to managing documents. It is used to capture and speed up human-marked data. For example multiple-choice tests the results of polls surveys consumer feedback and so on. After scanning the documents the Machine Learning algorithms detect the location. It can recognize hand-written marks much faster than human employees. Hence businesses can complete routine tasks time- and resource-efficiently and foster workflow automation.

‚óè Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR)

Intelligent character recognition aims at solving more sophisticated challenges. Using this technology machines can easily process raw hand-written documents. The level of accuracy varies from 50% to 70%‚Äîdepending on cursive handwriting block letters fonts styles etc. Bonus point this level of accuracy can be improved via further training the Machine Learning algorithm on rich datasets of specific data.

‚óè Intelligent Document Recognition (IDR)

Volumes of unstructured documents are produced in complex business processes taking the case of the logistics and finance industry. Intelligent Document Recognition can extract data from any document part including meta description. It not only incorporates the capabilities of OCR but also enhances it. IDR technology can interpret tables patterns and content in electronic and paper formats by recognizing the beginning and end of documents and categorizing them. Any required data can be extracted whether stored in a database or used in business apps.

‚óè QR Code Recognition

As data occurs in different formats for instance being encrypted in QR codes automated data capture can be conducted via different systems. This scan-and-go system has transformed the traditional way of shopping by facilitating hassle-free payments check-out-free stores self-servicing etc. QR code recognition has become a novel solution for many industry giants like Walmart Amazon Starbucks and the likes of the same for capturing data on merchandise and making payments.

‚óè Voice Recognition

Voice assistants like Siri Cortona Alexa and Google Assistant are powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology. Simply say ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù or ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù to awaken the system dictate the command and get your answer.

NLP approaches based on deep learning algorithms are used in different areas such as marketing interpreting security support services etc. NLP embedded in electronic data capture systems helps collect clinical trial data or patient data that can be entered manually or via voice.

Final Words

Decisions processes and actions that use data can be automated in a variety of ways as stated but fall somewhere between mostly human-based and completely automated. In the age of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence companies that embrace some degree of automation in their core processes such as data collection and capture processes are more likely to gain a competitive advantage‚Äîthrough rapid granular and more sophisticated decision-making. Gartner also predicts that by 2025 ‚Äú95% of decisions that currently use data will be at least partially automated.‚Äù Hence leaders can efficiently create decision intelligence with organizational competency.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA5LTAzL2pvYnMtcmVwb3J0LXNob3dzLXN1cHBseS1yZXR1cm5pbmctZXZlbi1hcy1mZWQtZm9jdXNlcy1vbi1kZW1hbmTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jobs Report Shows Supply Returning Even as Fed Focuses on Demand,"Why did this happen?

The video features the employee Sammy (@sammylocodoee) as he works behind the counter at an AutoZone location and speaks to a customer who wants to return window washer fluid. For a minute and a half Sammy and the customer are speaking in circles Sammy repeatedly explaining how AutoZone can‚Äôt accept the bottle with a cracked seal.

The customer then continually protests Sammy‚Äôs rejection claiming that he should be allowed to return the item as he ensured the fluid was at the same level as when he first purchased it.

Sammy explains that he can‚Äôt accept the return due to the store‚Äôs policy.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve shopped here for over 2 years now‚Äù the customer replies noting that he‚Äôs always been able to return items at both AutoZone and O‚ÄôReilly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never had this issue with you.‚Äù

The worker once again explains that once the seal is broken he is unable to accept a return. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if you used it‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúYou could‚Äôve poured Gatorade in it.‚Äù

The customer then demands to speak to the manager.

‚ÄúI am the manager‚Äù Sammy responds before the customer then requests to speak to the district manager.

‚ÄúHis number is on the front door and on your way out you can read the return policy‚Äù the worker adds.

Before leaving the customer accuses Sammy of being ‚Äúcompletely unprofessional.‚Äù The TikToker then apologizes for the inconvenience and wishes him a good day.

‚ÄúGo fuck yourself‚Äù the customer responds while walking away.

According to AutoZone‚Äôs website requests for a refund can be denied if the item has been used or installed. The only way to receive a refund is to return the product within 90 days in its original packaging along with the receipt.

The video has amassed 1.1 million views as of Sunday. Many people in the comments sided with Sammy and commended him on his professionalism in dealing with the ‚ÄúKaren.‚Äù

‚Äú‚ÄòThis is completely unprofessional you know that?‚Äô This is one of the most professional exchanges i‚Äôve ever seen‚Äù one user complimented.

‚ÄúYou were very respectful too‚Äù a second said.

‚Äú‚ÄòI am the manager‚Äô that made me so happy. You weren‚Äôt rude. You didn‚Äôt get scared. Good for you!‚Äù a third wrote.

Additionally several others claiming to be O‚ÄôReilly Auto Parts employees said they also don‚Äôt accept open containers.

‚ÄúAs an O‚ÄôReilly employee if it‚Äôs cracked we don‚Äôt return it as well‚Äù one user confirmed.

‚ÄúI do the same at O‚ÄôReillys. Seal broken no returns. Electrical part installed can‚Äôt return‚Äù a second concurred.

The Daily Dot reached out to Sammy via TikTok comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29hc3RhbC5jb20vYnV6ei9idWlsZGluZ3VwamF4L2EtcnVubmluZy1saXN0LW9mLXdoYXRzLWNvbWluZy10by1ub3J0aGVybi1zdC1qb2hucy1jb3VudHkv0gFlaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVjb2FzdGFsLmNvbS9idXp6L2J1aWxkaW5ndXBqYXgvYS1ydW5uaW5nLWxpc3Qtb2Ytd2hhdHMtY29taW5nLXRvLW5vcnRoZXJuLXN0LWpvaG5zLWNvdW50eS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Running List of What‚Äôs Coming to Northern St. Johns County,"LAST UPDATED: Sept. 3 2022

It‚Äôs no secret that northern St. Johns County is experiencing a massive development boom right now.

Over the past decade thousands of single-family and multi-family living units have popped up throughout land that had long sat undeveloped near the county line between southern Duval and northern St. Johns. And with any significant growth in population commercial development soon follows.

Over half a dozen retail center projects have sprung up in the northern St. Johns area. The largest of these projects Durbin Park has been detailed frequently by local publications including our own. We even created a running list of future Durbin Park tenants which became one of our most-viewed articles of all time showing the clear interest in retail growth in the area.

That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve decided to make a dedicated list for all of the other less-mentioned developments that are underway in the northern St. Johns area. We‚Äôve listed what we know so far below and we‚Äôll keep updating the list as new tenants and projects are announced.

Be sure to check back frequently for updates. And if you wish to utilize these lists on your own page please be sure to link back to our original list!

REVIEW ‚Äì Back in the day I used to work on my own cars but I gave it up as they became more computer than mechanical. My check engine light came on the other day so I decided to see if I could diagnose it myself but you need a scanner to do that these days. Enter the Innova 7111 Smart Diagnostic System OBD-II Tablet to help me avoid a trip to the mechanic.

What is it?

When your check engine light comes on it is because your Engine Control Unit (ECU) detected a Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) from the multitude of sensors in today‚Äôs vehicles. The Innova 7111 Smart Diagnostic System OBD-II Tablet is an on-board diagnostics (OBD) scanner that plugs into your car to read those DTCs from the ECU. This lets you troubleshoot and ideally repair any issues that the computer detects.

Design and features

What makes the 7111 Innova‚Äôs flagship scanner is the built-in integration of the RepairSolutions2 app. For all their other scanners you have to download the app to your phone and connect the scanner to the app. Along with basic functions such as vehicle global scanning diagnostics network scan scanning selected modules live data reading and erasing digital trouble codes the Innova 7111 can do more advanced things such as in-use performance tracking service resets and viewing drive cycle procedures. While not as capable as a dealer level scanner it has more features than an entry level scanner.

The Innova 7111 Smart Diagnostic System arrived well packaged and in a convenient storage case. I did find the case itself a little tricky at first to get the tablet and the power adapter back in so that the lid would close and I wish there was some more room so it didn‚Äôt have to be placed in such a specific way. Also a sleeve in the lid would have been nice to put the manual which I printed out (78 pages) since I wanted a hard copy to read.

The tablet has a nice solid feel to it and is well protected on the corners and edges. The power button is easy to find by feel and the cable seems pretty sturdy and connected to the tablet really well. I found myself picking it up by the cable a few times but it doesn‚Äôt seem like the cable will come out easily. All the ports are well protected with sturdy rubber covers. Underneath you‚Äôll find the USB micro-b charging port a TF card slot (which per Innova is currently disabled) headphone port micro HDMI port to connect to an external display and on the back there is a very convenient folding stand along with what looks like a camera lens that is also disabled.

I turned the Innova 7111 Smart Diagnostic System OBD-II Tablet on and after connecting to my WiFi the firmware was automatically updated. After that instead of only four tabs which are shown in product photos of the 7111 you now have six on the main screen. Connecting to a vehicle is as easy as finding the vehicle‚Äôs OBD-II port which is always within two feet of the driver so it is typically right under the dash area below the steering wheel. There‚Äôs only one way to plug it in and then turn the vehicle ignition on but do not start the engine. You then turn the Innova 7111 on and once it takes a few moments to boot it will immediately scan for vehicle information. Every vehicle I plugged into it was able to pull make model and VIN but on a few it wasn‚Äôt able to read the mileage. If it is unable to read the vehicle information at all you can enter the VIN manually as well as enter mileage manually if needed.

After the Innova 7111 Smart Diagnostic System OBD-II Tablet detects your vehicle the main screen displays the different tabs you can choose from. I‚Äôm not sure and the manual doesn‚Äôt specify what the difference is between the Global OBD and the Network Scan. They seem to do the same thing. The Select Module tab lets you select a specific module such as the brake systems instead of performing a complete scan to save time. Global Live Data allows you to view live data when the vehicle is running. Service Reset allows you to reset certain functions such as oil light battery or brakes. Finally Custom Scan lets you set up a scan to your preferences.

DTCs are displayed in four categories in the following order: Primary Stored Pending and Permanent. On my 2011 BMW X5d I did have to input the mileage manually but everything else it detected automatically. A check engine light came on the other day but I just had an oil change and my mechanic said everything looked good so I wanted to see what was going on.

After running the Global OBD scan I was a little surprised to see four failed modules and seven total DTCs. I found that only for the Primary DTC the scanner will go into more detail on what the DTC means. For all other DTCs I had to look them up on the internet with another device. This was a little annoying and for the cost and the integration of the RepairSolutions2 app I would have expected the ability to view detailed information along with potential fixes listed and even the ability to search the web for videos or more information which you can do on the TOPDON ArtiDiag600 scanner previously reviewed on the Gadgeteer.

If you select the maintenance tab the Innova 7111 will tell you what upcoming maintenance is needed based on your mileage with estimated parts costs. It will then show a link to your parts retailer of choice to order them. I entered Amazon as the retailer and it did indeed go to the required part.

I also looked at a friend‚Äôs 2010 Ford Escape and was able to email him a pdf report of the scan so that was convenient. A coworker had just changed his oil himself and I was able to reset his 2008 Toyota Tacoma‚Äôs oil light and reset all his DTCs from a bad battery he had replaced but neither of those had Primary DTCs which cause the check engine light to come on. I did look at another friend‚Äôs 2010 Ford Explorer which did have a primary DTC for a coolant thermostat. The ECU also stored a freeze frame of vehicle data at the time of the DTC incident so you can see that by clicking freeze frame.

The most likely fix was displayed and the option to buy the parts directly. He called a shop and they quoted him $100 in parts and $500 in labor. He decided to watch some YouTube videos and will attempt the repair himself for less than $50 in parts.

When I plugged the Innova 7111 into my 2018 Honda Pilot I found four failed modules with numerous DTCs but since none were listed as a Primary DTC I could not see potential fixes or detailed information on those DTCs. Since my Pilot didn‚Äôt have a check engine light these were DTCs that had occurred but were just stored and did not cause the MIL lamp to turn on. For example it showed one code U1101 F-Can Malfunction (PCM-ACM Control Unit) and that was it. No further detailed explanation or potential fixes. I had to look it up on my phone or go to my computer and I feel like that is an unnecessary step when I am using a $599 tablet with WiFi capability.

I did use the live scan feature a few times which showed temperature RPM battery voltage and speed along with the ability to record. You are supposed to be able to select or deselect what data you want to view but for some reason I was unable to change the default selections as the check boxes were grayed out.

The predicted repairs tab displayed parts that are likely to fail in the next 12 months or 15k miles along with estimated cost to repair. I hope it‚Äôs wrong.

In all I used the Innova 7111 Smart Diagnostic System OBD-II Tablet to scan 10 cars for a total of 40 individual scans and I did like that the results were stored in the history section so I could go back and look them up later. If all 10 cars had gone to a mechanic diagnostic fees alone would have been well over the $599 cost of the Innova 7111 however it is not without its shortcomings. I expected more from their flagship product and although Innova has integrated the RepairSolutions2 app into the 7111 its capability is still limited and you have to be connected to WiFi to run those reports. The Innova 7111 can only provide verified or potential fixes on Primary DTCs only. For Stored Pending and Permanent DTCs the Innova 7111 provides no further analysis besides reporting the code and a basic name.

What I like

Works on almost every car

Easy to use touchscreen design

Free updates

What I‚Äôd change

Storage case could be a better fit

Better RepairSolutions2 integration with more detailed explanations of DTCs and potential fixes with built in web searches

Final Thoughts:

Although this scan tool is geared more toward the advanced weekend warrior I found some basic features lacking. For the average DIYer just trying to find out what your check engine light means you might want to look at Innova‚Äôs cheaper diagnostic tools such as the Innova CarScan Pro 5610 previously reviewed on the Gadgeteer which is about half the price. If you already have an OBD scan tool and are looking to upgrade the Innova 7111 does have more advanced features that entry-level scanners may not have. I think Innova is on the right track trying to integrate the RepairSolutions2 app into a scanner; however some more tweaking is needed to retain all the features available in its smartphone counterpart. The Innova 7111 seems to be a product that has potential but was rushed to market too soon and they are relying on future firmware updates to fix. At least that is a possibility so I‚Äôm hoping they can resolve a lot of the shortcomings and if that happens the Innova 7111 will truly be a ‚Äòsmart‚Äô diagnostic system.

It's been that way nearly since the beginning of the pandemic when the company sent most of its workers home leaving the 450000-square-foot office building nearly empty. And like a lot of large companies Prudential began re-evaluating its space needs.

Late last month the company sold the property to a pair of development companies that decided that although the building is only 42 years old it doesn't have the features and amenities most companies want. Demolition is the only sensible option they determined.

""It's getting more and more difficult to fill existing [office] space ... and that's a really tough building to repurpose"" said Jeff Koch principal partner of Twin Cities-based Roers Cos. ""But it's a perfect site for residential.""

Koch and Dan Salzer a director of development for Scannell Properties said that over the next five years the team plans to spend $300 million to build 12 to 15 buildings that will include rental apartments medical offices and retail space in what will become one of the biggest redevelopment projects in the metro.

While there's plenty of demand for housing demand for traditional office space is weak and the future of the sector remains uncertain brokers say.

An estimated 18 to 25 % of all office space in the Twin Cities is empty and the situation is likely to worsen as leases expire and companies downsize leaving vacancy rates elevated for the ""foreseeable future"" according to a new report from Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL)

The group said the average vacancy rate for offices across the metro has increased slightly since the beginning of the year rising to 18% during the second quarter.

""Large tenants are still hunkered down and figuring out how and what hybrid work means"" said Jon Dahl a managing director in Minneapolis for JLL.

He said smaller companies are having an easier time determining their future space needs because they have a better handle on what works and what doesn't. Most of the active shoppers are in the market for spaces with 2000 to 10000 square feet. A few companies Dahl said are on hunt for 30000 to 40000 square feet.

""Small tenants are wanting new space and moving into new buildings"" he said. ""But there's a lot more movement than there normally would be.""

Dahl said that in a normal market there's a 75% probability of a tenant renewing but those odds are now below 50%. Still Dahl thinks the vacancy rate in downtown is close to leveling out.

Cushman Wakefield's estimates are even more dour. The company's second-quarter report shows that the average office vacancy rate across the metro was closer to 25% after hovering at around 18% for the three years prior to the pandemic.

The group said that leasing activity across the metro has remained relatively steady over the past several quarters. But for the eighth consecutive quarter more office space has been vacated than occupied.

Excluding the massive vacancy at City Center after Target Corp. left the building absorption during the second quarter was slightly positive given that several companies have signed leases and there have been several high-profile move-ins especially in downtown Minneapolis.

Those recently signed deals included Fox Rothschild which is taking nearly 40000 square feet of that former Target space. ESG Architecture & Design said it will take 20000 square feet at the new North Loop Green. In both cases however those new leases are downsizings from previous offices creating a net increase in available space.

During the second quarter Agiliti and HelpSystems moved into One Southwest Crossing and the Pohlad Cos. and JLL moved into their new office space at the RBC Gateway tower.

Demand has been especially strong in the North Loop which is now back to pre-pandemic leasing levels. The buildings in that area he said have the kinds of amenities and features that many companies want. Canteen One for example announced a move from the suburbs to a more than 40000-square-foot space in the North Loop.

""Companies are not shying away from quality space"" Paul Donovan executive director at Cushman Wakefield said. ""They just want less of it.""

With more than 2.3 million square feet of ""active office requirements"" (companies looking for space) JLL says leasing activity might increase slightly in the second half of 2022. If so that could push some new speculative office development forward in downtown Minneapolis and St. Louis Park's West End.

Though the future of the office sector is uncertain many investors are still shopping for and buying office properties especially those with the best amenities and in the best locations.

There have been several notable deals this year including the recent sale of the 1.7 million-square-foot Normandale Lake Office Park to Opal Holdings its first acquisition in the Minneapolis-St. Paul market.

That property which was nearly fully leased quickly found a buyer after being marketed but it closed for slightly less than the $369 million the seller paid in 2014.

Overall though investment sales have been relatively slow since the beginning of the pandemic. Higher interest rates have put downward pressure on prices and rising construction costs have only made such deals more challenging.

Still higher vacancy rates aren't necessarily leading to bargains for redevelopment sites. Koch said that when he first contacted Prudential to see if it would be willing to sell even a portion of its property in Plymouth he expected a deal. That wasn't the case.

""We thought we'd see a fire sale for office properties"" Koch said. ""We thought we'd get this for pennies on the dollar.""

Koch said that even at market prices it still made sense to do the acquisition. He'd long seen opportunity in the rolling hills and ponds on the Prudential property which he passed on his daily commute.

So just after the start of the pandemic thinking the company might be looking to downsize its holdings he made the call. His timing was perfect. The company said it was willing to sell the entire property.

Since closing at the end of August the development process has just begun. Land preparation is expected to begin in 2023 and it'll take about five years to fully redevelop the site into retail medical office buildings multifamily residential and a business park.

""This is going to be a vibrant new destination for the community"" Scannell said. ""Where people can live work shop eat and gather.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvaW53b3JsZC5jb20vbmV3cy91cy1jb2lucy9tYXJrZXQtYW5hbHlzaXMtbG93LWJhbGwtMTkzMC1zLWdvbGQtZG91YmxlLWVhZ2xl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Market Analysis: 'Low-ball' 1930-S gold double eagle,"The Stack‚Äôs Bowers Galleries and Heritage auctions held the week after the American Numismatic Association World‚Äôs Fair of Money at the auctioneers‚Äô headquarters were massive this year.

The San Francisco Mint issue is a late rarity in the series with around 75 estimated to have survived from 74000 struck since most were melted around the time of issue. Nearly all survivors are Mint State or nearly so but this one has extensive wear with design elements that merge with the rim.

Heritage wrote: ‚ÄúThis coin was clearly carried as a pocket piece and it may well be unique in this grade among 1930-S double eagles. A true once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the low-ball Registry collector.‚Äù

The event co-hosted by Giorgio Armani and Vanity Fair was held during the Venice Film Festival and featured a star-studded guest list including Sydney Sweeney Irina Shayk and Chase Stokes.

While arriving at the Ca‚ÄôVendramin Calergi for the occasion Deschanel donned a pale green Armani Priv√© gown. Her elegant number featured a large blue and red floral print covered in a sweeping tulle outer skirt embroidered with sparkling crystals. Completing the piece was a halter-neck bodice including a ruched front and glittering draping with black silver and light green crystals. Deschannel finished her outfit with sparkling diamond bracelets a diamond ring and light green mesh clutch.

The new program is geared toward first-time homebuyers including in designated neighborhoods in Charlotte Dallas Detroit Los Angeles and Miami. Bank of America said the program will not take a borrower's credit score into account when applying for a home loan. Instead creditworthiness will be based on such factors as timely payment of rent as well as phone auto insurance and utility bills.

""Our Community Affordable Loan Solution will help make the dream of sustained homeownership attainable for more Black and Hispanic families and it is part of our broader commitment to the communities that we serve"" AJ Barkley Bank of America's head of neighborhood and community lending said in a statement.

Black and Hispanic families typically don't have a large stash of cash on hand to fund a home down payment and closing costs so Bank of America removing those barriers will certainly help someone on the hunt for home Indiana University finance professor Jun Zhu told CBS News.

""If you have a program with no down payment and no closing costs it can help minority families to fill the gap between available savings and upfront cash needed"" said Zhu an expert on mortgage financing and housing affordability.

To qualify for the Bank of America program applicants must seek to buy a home in one of the five cities and complete a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development-certified homebuyer course. Applicants won't need mortgage insurance after they've acquired the loan.

Rates of homeownership vary dramatically across racial and ethnic groups thanks to differences in wealth and the legacy of historic discrimination. About 7 in 10 White households own homes while only 4 in 10 Black households and 5 in 10 Hispanic households do according to the National Association of Realtors.

Editor's note: The initial version of this story wrongly stated that only Black and Hispanic borrowers are eligible for a mortgage under Bank of America's Community Affordable Loan Solution program. In fact the program is eligible to all borrowers based on their income and home location.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9zdG9jay1tYXJrZXQtaGl0LWJvdHRvbS15ZXQtMTEzMDAwNTU3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Has the stock market hit bottom yet? Bank of America says 6 of 10 signs point to no,"The S&P 500‚Äôs decline this year‚Äîit‚Äôs down nearly 18% since January‚Äîaccelerated last week after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated more ‚Äúpain‚Äù was ahead.

Has the market hit bottom? Bank of America Research based on its new list of 10 signals showing whether the stock market has hit bottom says no.

View this interactive chart on Fortune.com

The bank came up with the list released on Friday after analyzing ‚Äúmacro and bottom-up data encompassing policy valuation growth sentiment and technical trends‚Äù the researchers said.

As of Friday only four of the 10 criteria have been met. That means there are six more that must be hit before it‚Äôs really a market bottom at least according to Bank of America‚Äôs formula.

The four indicators that are considered triggered include the unemployment rate rising. The latest monthly jobs report released Friday showed that the unemployment rate rose to 3.7% in August from 3.5% the month prior a relatively good sign in terms of reducing inflation because it hints that the economy is slowing.

Additional positive indicators for a market bottom included the bear-to-bull ratio of major investors whose sentiments lean toward a more bearish outlook. The others were multiple bear market rallies of 5% or more (the bank says there have been two rallies of 5% or more so far) and the Purchasing Managers‚Äô Index‚Äîa measure of the prevailing direction of economic trends in manufacturing‚Äîhas improved on a year-over-year basis.

But six out of 10 signs have yet to turn favorable for a market rebound according to Bank of America.

The Federal Reserve must start cutting interest rates which would signal that inflation is under control (in fact the Fed has been increasing rates). Also the equity risk premium or excess returns over the risk-free rate that investors expect for taking on the incremental risks connected to the market must increase by more than 75 basis points.

Additionally the two-year Treasury yield must decline 50 basis points or more from its highs; the yield curve‚Äîa tool that helps understand the bond market‚Äîmust steepen; the trailing price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 when added to the Consumer Price Index must be below 20; and there must be the presence of ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù signals within the Bank of America‚Äôs ‚ÄúSell Side Indicator‚Äù that tracks average stock allocation recommendations by strategists.

In Bank of America‚Äôs view the market has more room to drop. And it‚Äôs unclear when all of the signals of a rebound will switch from red to green.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on August 31 affirmed a district court‚Äôs ruling that Verify Smart Corp had failed to plausibly allege an agency relationship between Wells Fargo and Bank of America (the ‚ÄúBanks‚Äù) and a banking industry group‚Äôs subsidiary sufficient to prove the Banks enlisted the subsidiary to challenge a patent they were contractually prohibited from challenging themselves.

Verify brought a patent infringement suit against the Banks for infringement of its multifactor-identification software. Bank of America challenged the patent but as part of a subsequent settlement agreement the Banks eventually agreed not to challenge the patent further. However following the settlement Askeladden LLC a subsidiary of the banking industry group The Clearing House Payments Company LLC (TCH) of which both banks were members challenged the patent at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) and got it invalidated. Verify then sued the Banks alleging they had breached the settlement by acting through Askeladden.

Verify argued that:

‚Äú(i) the Banks and their peer institutions own and control TCH; (ii) TCH owns and controls Askeladden;

(iii) TCH created Askeladden to challenge patents that adversely [a]ffect TCH‚Äôs owners including the Banks;

(iv) TCH controls Askeladden‚Äôs patent challenges on behalf of the Banks; and

(v) Askeladden has an established practice of suing patent owners after TCH‚Äôs member banks settle their patent challenges and it did just that here.‚Äù

Verify amended its complaint twice but the district court dismissed its Third Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim against the Banks for breach of contract and fraud because its reliance on Askeladden‚Äôs LLC Agreement ‚Äúcontradicted the existence of any agency relationship.‚Äù Specifically the district court said that several provisions of the LLC Agreement ‚Äúsuggest the opposite‚Äù such as the Agreement‚Äôs mandate that Askeladden ‚Äúshall have a Patent Challenge Committee‚Äù whose purpose ‚Äúshall be to independently implement manage and conduct that aspect of the Company‚Äôs Patent Quality Initiative directed to challenging the validity of low-quality patents as specified in the Patent Challenge Guidelines‚Äù; that the PCC ‚Äúshall operate independently of the Executive Committee [TCH] and any other Person that is affiliated with or otherwise related to [TCH]‚Äù; and that although TCH could appoint individuals ‚Äúto assist and support the activities of the [PCC]‚Äù they ‚Äúshall have no authority to direct bind or otherwise control the activities of the [PCC].‚Äù The LLC Agreement also explicitly prohibited any requests that the PCC institute review of specific patents or patents of a specific patent owner ‚Äúor any direction or suggestion . . . from the Executive Committee [TCH] or any other Person that is affiliated with or otherwise related to [TCH].‚Äù

The district court further found that Verify had failed to establish that the several individuals Verify identified as being associated with the Banks had ‚Äúany authority to direct Askeladden to challenge patents‚Äù or that they had ever directly communicated with the Banks regarding the patent challenge.

On appeal the Third Circuit in a very brief discussion affirmed the district court‚Äôs motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim explaining that although it agreed the timing of Askeladden‚Äôs challenge to the patent was ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù it also agreed ‚Äúthat the LLC Agreement actually shows that the Banks do not control which patents Askeladden challenges.‚Äù Furthermore Verify had presented no facts showing that any Bank officer had authority or responsibility related to Askeladden.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vc21hbGxiaXp0cmVuZHMuY29tL2Jhbmstb2YtYW1lcmljYS1sYXVuY2hlcy1ncmFudHMtdG8tc3VwcG9ydC11bmRlcnNlcnZlZC1idXNpbmVzc2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bank of America Launches Grants to Support Underserved Businesses in Select Cities,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vc21hbGxiaXp0cmVuZHMuY29tL2Jhbmstb2YtYW1lcmljYS1sYXVuY2hlcy1ncmFudHMtdG8tc3VwcG9ydC11bmRlcnNlcnZlZC1idXNpbmVzc2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000167124FD690>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vc21hbGxiaXp0cmVuZHMuY29tL2Jhbmstb2YtYW1lcmljYS1sYXVuY2hlcy1ncmFudHMtdG8tc3VwcG9ydC11bmRlcnNlcnZlZC1idXNpbmVzc2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Text description provided by the architects. Jocheon is a small village on the northeastern coast of Jeju. It is a seaside village known as a great place to see the sunrise every day. To the north is the blue sea of Jocheon and freshwater springs from the ground near the beach. Jocheon has been a clean and abundant village with clean spring water which was used by the people for washing and drinking before the waterworks were installed. This plot of land silently watching over the sea is about 18 square meters in size and is on the boundary between the beach of Jocheon and the freshwater springs.

This was a place for the travelers to begin and end their day. So what did it have to offer? We focused on the element of ‚Äòwater‚Äô as harbored by the beach of Jocheon. We wanted the most daily element to give the most non-daily experience in this space. ‚ÄòTaking a bath‚Äô is a very simple and daily action yet a powerful ritual of rearranging one‚Äôs mind and relieving the physical and mental fatigue. The Chinese character for bath is Êµ¥ (Yok).

It represents the pouring water and means to clean the wastes with the force of water flowing downwards. We planned this space to be a place for relaxing and recharging focusing on the acts of washing and wiping in a space filled with various forms of water such as pouring water gushing water still water gazing water and steam.

The Jocheon Yokjang is a small bath place consisting of 3 floors that are about 15 square meters each. The building was designed to be within 50 square meters without a parking area so that the yard can be used more widely and it is a private space for only 2 people. The 3rd floor is a bathing space with an ocean view and various washing experiences. The 2nd floor is the bedroom and the 1st floor is the kitchen. The vertical concrete building is only open on the sides that come in contact with nature.

Only the surfaces that accept the ocean view and light are open and all other surfaces are completely shut from the outer world. The concrete walls have wood grain patterns that hold the movement of light. Along the basalt wall is the entrance path that opens into the garden and through the garden is the inside of the house. The entrance path is long enough to heighten the immersion in the space and the unpredictable changes of the space diversify the experience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxzaW1wbGUuY29tL2hvdy1vZnRlbi1zaG91bGQteW91LWNoYW5nZS15b3VyLWJhdGgtdG93ZWwtODY0NDg2NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's How Often You Should Change Your Bath Towel,"After a shower you probably throw your bath towel over a wall hook to dry. It‚Äôll hang there until the next time you need to towel off‚Äîunless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There‚Äôs a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

‚ÄúGenerally you should change your towels every three to four uses‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThis helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.‚Äù

It‚Äôs important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

‚ÄúHowever if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently‚Äù she adds. ‚ÄúThe same applies to those who live in humid climates‚Äîbecause towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.‚Äù

Your Towel's Material

Your towel‚Äôs material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

‚ÄúThanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel‚Äù explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. ‚ÄúIn our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.‚Äù

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

‚ÄúFactors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes‚Äù say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. ‚ÄúIf your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements‚Äù say the experts at Cozy Earth. ‚ÄúOver time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.‚Äù

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

‚ÄúPersonally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one‚Äù says Gutierrez. ‚ÄúI have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They‚Äôre quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.‚Äù

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

There are lots of things that go into Met Gala prep. Kim Kardashian had to learn the art of breathing in a corset for example. If you‚Äôre Jessica Biel the night before the Met Gala was all about dumping more Epsom salt than anyone has ever needed into a bathtub. How much Epsom salt do you think that would be? A pound maybe? Two? Think bigger.

In a TikTok Biel shared that she would be spending the night before the Met Gala soaking in a bath filled with 20 pounds of Epsom salt. That‚Äôs five full bags of magnesium sulfate. Dr. Teal‚Äôs the brand used by Biel in the video recommends customers use ‚Äúat least‚Äù two cups per bath to relax muscles and reduce inflammation. So technically she is following the instructions.

For scale the average 1-year-old weighs about 20 pounds. Why would anyone need a baby-size amount of Epsom salts in their bath? Biel did not explain her reasoning but kindly shared her routine. The actress said your bath should have ‚Äúwater as hot as you can take it.‚Äù Then she instructed you soak for 30 minutes then ‚Äúdrink tons of water‚Äù and ‚Äúoff to bed early.‚Äù Anyone who has ever taken an Epsom-salt bath knows that there‚Äôs no way you wouldn‚Äôt be off to bed early after soaking in that high of a concentration.

If you think that maybe 20 pounds of Epsom salt might fix everything for you think again. First of all that‚Äôs like a $25 bath. Second of all medical professionals don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea. Dr. T.N. Rekha Singh told Yahoo Life that Biel‚Äôs method could have negative side effects. ‚ÄúOveruse or excessively concentrated solutions can lead to dehydration salt imbalance or magnesium overdose‚Äù she told the website.

Long story short you don‚Äôt need more than two cups of Epsom salt to get the maximum amount of relaxation. Your muscles will still thank you and ‚Äî I‚Äôm just guessing on this one ‚Äî so will your pipes. (That much salt can‚Äôt be good for them right?)

When Berkshire Hathaway Inc. started trimming its stake in BYD Co. theories swirled about the prospects for China‚Äôs largest electric-vehicle maker. Turns out it‚Äôs less about the company and more about Warren Buffett being Warren Buffett.Berkshire has begun shedding BYD stock  dragging down the firm‚Äôs shares as traders feared an exit by its most notable backer. For BYD with profit that just tripled and a nearly 30% share in China‚Äôs expanding electric-car manufacturing market the stock sales struck some as puzzling.But the share sales probably don‚Äôt reflect concerns about BYD‚Äôs fundamental business and rather underscore the billionaire investor‚Äôs relentless focus on intrinsic value according to analysts. Buffett Berkshire‚Äôs chairman and chief executive officer has made billions of dollars from the holding since he invested around $230 million in 2008. The stake is now worth north of $8 billion.‚ÄúBerkshire has benefited greatly from what BYD‚Äôs done -- they‚Äôve made wonderful money‚Äù said Cole Smead president of investment firm Smead Capital Management. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs watched it grow and now based on the price the open market is giving right now he‚Äôs saying: I‚Äôm willing to take money off the table to go elsewhere.‚ÄùBerkshire didn‚Äôt immediately respond to requests for comment.BYD shares plunged 7.9% in Hong Kong on Wednesday the most in seven weeks and the worst performance on the benchmark Hang Seng Index. The selling followed Berkshire‚Äôs filing to the exchange late Tuesday saying its holding of BYD‚Äôs Hong Kong-listed shares had fallen to 19.92% from 20.04% on Aug. 24.Buffett is a disciple of the value strategy which focuses on long-term intrinsic value with a goal of buying shares in good firms at reasonable prices. That way investors avoid fast-growing firms with expensive stocks and the fickle gyrations of the market. Berkshire has held stakes in Coca-Cola Co. and American Express Co. for decades.It‚Äôs a strategy that‚Äôs served him well with Berkshire shares outpacing the S&P 500 Index since 1965 when Buffett took over the company.In recent years though analysts note there‚Äôs been more of a ‚Äútrading component‚Äù to Berkshire‚Äôs equity portfolio which Buffett‚Äôs investing deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler help run. Berkshire has held certain stocks for shorter periods according to Meyer Shields an analyst with Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an increased willingness to adjust things down when they‚Äôre less attractive‚Äù Shields said. ‚ÄúTheir sense is if this is now above intrinsic value as we assess it it may be good to sell the stock. Given where the BYD price is that has to be the conclusion they‚Äôre drawing.‚ÄùBuffett has certainly ridden the BYD wave. Shares in the company gained 31% last year and surged 423% in 2020 as it benefited from China‚Äôs shift from gasoline and diesel-powered cars to electric vehicles. BYD also produces semiconductors and is now the world‚Äôs third-largest producer of batteries for EVs with 14% of the market.Theories about Buffett‚Äôs plans for the electric-car maker have percolated since a 20.49% stake -- identical to the size of Berkshire‚Äôs last reported BYD position in Hong Kong as of the end of June -- entered the Central Clearing and Settlement System in July a sign to investors a sale may be imminent. That triggered the biggest slump in BYD stock in nearly two years.The appearance of that stake in the clearinghouse likely means Buffett eventually intends to exit according to Smead.After trimming its stake further Berkshire has now jettisoned 3.05 million BYD shares or 1.4% of Buffett‚Äôs known 225-million-share holding. Its interest in BYD‚Äôs Hong Kong-listed stock has now fallen to 18.87% from 19.02% with the latest securities sold for an average of HK$262.72 apiece. It‚Äôll likely continue to sell chunks this way Smead said.‚ÄúIf your ultimate goal is to exit the investment altogether it doesn‚Äôt look good in the eyes of the Chinese regulators for Buffett to come in and sell aggressively and disrupt the market‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf they want to do future investments with China they are better off selling this way.‚ÄùBerkshire started investing in BYD after Buffett‚Äôs long-term business partner Charlie Munger -- who bought the stock with Himalaya Capital‚Äôs Chairman Li Lu -- recommended the investment. Li once a contender to manage Berkshire‚Äôs investments and a BYD shareholder for more than a decade cut his stake to about 5% last year representing a 28% reduction.Munger has been bullish on China even amid worsening relations between Beijing and Washington. At Berkshire‚Äôs annual meeting this year Munger said he invested in the country because he was ‚Äúwilling to take a little bit of risk to get into the better companies at the lower prices.‚ÄùBerkshire invests in BYD stock through its energy business which also fully owns utility companies throughout the US. Energy is a ‚Äúcore pillar‚Äù of Berkshire‚Äôs operations according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Matthew Palazola. Berkshire last month won approval from US regulators to buy as much as 50% of Occidental Petroleum Corp. after spending months snapping up its shares.Whatever the fate of Berkshire‚Äôs BYD stake Palazola estimates it represents about 2% of Berkshire‚Äôs investment portfolio.‚ÄúFor moving the needle on the financials of Berkshire it‚Äôs minuscule‚Äù he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzljYTU2OTljLTY2ZTQtNDY3NC04ZjM4LWY5OGQzMzhkM2YzZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Asset Management: Julian Robertson's life and times,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

Baptism under fire as they call it ‚ÄòMoney‚Äô has handed a humbling punishment to many an individual in the sport of boxing. However that Mayweather once spilled blood on investor-cum-magnate-cum-philanthropist Warren Buffett is a rare story occasionally heard.

In The Pivot Podcast accompanied by Alex Rodriguez a former Major League Baseball player Floyd Mayweather opened up about the time he had stained Warren Buffett‚Äôs expensive suit with blood. ‚ÄúWarren Buffett came to the boxing gym; we shot a commercial together actually‚Äù. ‚ÄúThat day I was sparring‚Äù. ‚ÄúI said I‚Äôm gonna get blood on your suit.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd I did eventually get blood on his suit from the sparring partner‚Äù narrated ‚ÄòMoney‚Äô gesturing with his hand.

‚ÄúI had to put a money team hat on him and take a picture with him‚Äù added Floyd Mayweather.

Floyd Mayweather and the dream that continues

Floyd Mayweather considers it to be ‚Äúgood‚Äù that he can call people like Warren Buffett who is currently the fifth-wealthiest person in the world. Additionally he believes that if individuals such as Warren Buffett and Jeff Bezos could do it so can he.

Mayweather who is one of the richest sports-person alive today and who earned a ‚Äúhundred-thousand-dollar‚Äù by his teenage feels that with money comes comfort. Of course as Mayweather says it allows one to do whatever they want in their life.

In addition ‚ÄòMoney‚Äô expresses that with age and experience comes growth. Undoubtedly true to his words Floyd Mayweather embodies the growth of the person to whom he refers.

While the discussion about inspiration and work ethic went on Mayweather shared a fascinating story. ‚ÄúWhen I was 10 I done my first autograph signing‚Äù said Money. ‚ÄúThis guy knew I was going to be big; he was a fan of my dad. I was 10 years old; he said sign this baseball‚Äù added Mayweather.

Last year when Mayweather fought Paul in an exhibition match he said something interesting during his post-fight ring interview. With a smile on his face he expressed that although he wasn‚Äôt 21; it was fun while still having a fight.

Whether it be Buffett or Bezos for Mayweather the dream shall never fade and the spirit shall never die.

To investigate the effects of low dose rate irradiation on chromosome damage we assessed whether a pretreatment with chronic low doses of Œ≥ rays (priming dose) affects the frequency of total chromosome breaks (CBs; for examples of CBs see Fig. 1a) induced by an acute Œ≥ dose of 10 Gy (challenging dose) in Drosophila third instar larvae neuroblasts. Vials containing 12 h old Drosophila embryos were placed at 23 ¬∞C inside the LIBIS irradiation facility19 and irradiated continuously at a dose rate of 2.5 mGy/h until they developed into third instar larvae (7 days for a final dose of 0.4 Gy herein 0.4 Gy LDR). Irradiated and non-irradiated control vials were then exposed to a challenging dose at the dose rate of about 0.7 Gy/min and 4 h later larval neuroblasts were analyzed for CBs frequency (Supplementary Fig. 1). Chromosomes were fixed at 4 h and 8 h post irradiation time points (PIR) to recover cells that were irradiated in the S-G 2 or G 1 stage respectively20. The average number of total chromosome breaks per cell (CBs/cell) was calculated by measuring the ratio of the total number of chromatid deletions (CDs scored as a single event) and isochromosome breaks (ISOs or chromosome deletions scored as two events) to the total number of metaphases (Fig. 1b). Cytological analysis of exposed pretreated and non-pretreated third instar larvae showed that in non-pretreated larvae the average number of CBs/cell induced by the challenging dose after 4 h PIR was ~1.0 in females and ~0.8 in males. Differently the 0.4 Gy LDR determined a ~2 fold decrease of CBs/cell frequency in both male and female larval neuroblasts indicating that the LDR treatment renders neuroblast chromosomes resistant to IR-induced DNA breakage as a result of the activation of radioadaptive response (RAR). Interestingly a 1.2 mGy/h dose rate for 7 days (0.2 Gy total dose) was not sufficient to trigger a RAR suggesting that this response could be dose rate dependent (Supplementary Fig. 2a).

(A) Wild-type female and (D) male metaphases; (B) female and (C F) male metaphases with examples of isochromosome breaks (arrows); (E) male metaphase showing autosomal chromatid deletions (arrows).

Chromosome exchanges did not vary and were not considered in the analysis. The CBs frequency of 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy treated larvae at 8 h and 4 h PIR was compared with that of 10 Gy treated larvae at the same PIR times. The CBs frequency of 10 Gy treated F1 and F2 was compared with that of 10 Gy exposed controls after 4 h PIR. Note that CBs frequency of 0.4 Gy LDR treated larvae were indistinguishable from that of NT larvae. n = 3 biologically independent experiments were conducted.

We sought to understand whether the 0.4 Gy LDR could affect CBs frequency also at 8 h PIR when cells are irradiated during the G 1 stage. The analysis of ~1000 female metaphases revealed no statistically significant difference on CBs frequency between non-pre-treated (~54%) and 0.4 Gy LDR treated (~45%) larvae at 8 h PIR (Fig. 1b). This suggests that 0.4 Gy LDR could primarily influence the HR-based repair systems that by employing sister chromatids as template for the DNA synthesis to regenerate the sequence surrounding the break site is restricted to S-G 2 phase21. Furthermore we evaluated whether the radiation resistance could be also maintained for more than one generation. Thus male and female adult flies that developed from 0.4 Gy LDR-pretreated larvae were mated to each other outside the LIBIS and the resulting F 1 larvae irradiated with 10 Gy. Interestingly we found that the frequency of CBs calculated at 4 h PIR was ~2 fold reduced in metaphases from both male and female F 1 larvae of 0.4 Gy LDR -derived adult parents (n = 1861 for both sexes) with respect to control F 1 larvae deriving from non-pretreated adults (Fig. 1b). This indicates that the RAR shows a transgenerational inheritance. However the F 1 obtained from reciprocal crossings between 0.4 Gy LDR-treated females or males and non-treated males or females respectively did not elicit RAR (Supplementary Table 1) suggesting that the transgenerational inheritance of RAR depends on both maternal and paternal factors.

To analyze whether the 0.4 Gy LDR affected the regulation of G 2 /M checkpoint we carried out a standard checkpoint assay evaluating the proportion of dividing cells (Mitotic Index MI) in larval brain cells fixed at different times after the challenging dose (10 Gy). As shown in Fig. 2a the MI of the non-pretreated Oregon R control brains dropped at 5‚Äì30 min PIR remained low for 1 h and came back to a normal value only at 2 h PIR. The MI of 0.4 Gy LDR -pretreated larvae decreased as much as in control brains at 5‚Äì30 min PIR but then markedly increased after 30 min PIR suggesting that the 0.4 Gy LDR exposure determined a faster recovery from the G 2 -M checkpoint (Fig. 2a) compared to non-pretreated cells most likely due to a reduced amount of DNA damage (~50%) to be repaired.

Fig. 2: The influence of cell cycle and DNA Damage Response (DDR) on the RAR. a Checkpoint assay of Oregon-R 0.4 Gy LDR chronically exposed Oregon-R larval brains versus non-treated (NT) controls. In the picture is shown the mitotic index (MI) calculated as the ratio between the total number of dividing cells and the number of optical fields. Note that the MI of 0.4 Gy LDR larvae increases after 60 min post-irradiation compared to NT control. n = 3 biologically independent experiments were conducted. Values of p < 0.05 (*) were considered as statistically significant (Student t-test). b EdU incorporation analysis of Oregon-R larval brain cells exposed to IR. EdU-positive cell nuclei of larval brains show 3 different incorporation patterns: S 1 represents early S phase nuclei that do not incorporate Edu in the DAPI-stained chromocenter; S 2 represents mid-S phase nuclei that incorporate EdU in all DAPI-stained nuclei; S 3 shows nuclei in the late S-phase that incorporate EdU only in the chromocenter. c Frequencies of EdU positive nuclei. The frequencies of EdU positive nuclei in each sample (NT 0.4 Gy LDR 10 Gy 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy) were obtained by examining at least 2000 nuclei from 3 brains. Values of p < 0.05 (*) were considered as statistically significant (Student t-test). d Quantification (%) of EdU positive cells divided in S1 S2 and S3 phases according to the staining pattern observed in (b). No statistical differences were observed in treated cells compared to controls. e DNA repair gene mutant larvae do not elicit RAR. Frequency of CBs induced by an acute 2 Gy 5 Gy or 10 Gy irradiation on 0.4 Gy LDR Drosophila strains mutated in genes involved in the DNA damage response (DDR). The ATPCL mutant was used as a control. Note that in all DNA repair (but not in ATPCLDG23) mutants RAR is abolished. ISOs isochromosome deletions CDs chromatid deletions CBs chromosome breaks NT non-treated PIR post-irradiation time. The comparisons of the CBs frequency were performed among 0.4 Gy LDR treated- and untreated mutants before and after the exposure to the challenging dose using Student‚Äôs t-test; ‚Ä†statistically significant for p < 0.01. Bar = 10 Œºm. Full size image

We also checked whether the rate of IR-induced apoptosis and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were influenced by the 0.4 Gy LDR. Immunostaining of whole-mounted brains and imaginal discs for cleaved-Caspase-3 revealed that the number of positive cells in treated larval brains was indistinguishable from that observed in non-pretreated control after the challenging dose indicating that RAR does not reduce the occurrence and distribution of apoptosis caused by extensive DNA damage (Supplementary Fig. 3a-d). Moreover using dihydroethidium (DHE) as an indicator we found that ROS levels in 10Gy-irradiated brains did not differ from those observed in 0.4 Gy LDR + 10Gy-irradiated brains although as expected they increased compared to unirradiated larvae (Supplementary Fig. 4). These results indicate that LDR does not lead to a statistically significant response to the ROS generating activity that could be taken into account to explain the radioresistance.

We finally compared the occurrence of DNA replication in non-pretreated and pretreated brain cells by analyzing the incorporation of the EdU (5-ethynyl-2‚Äô-deoxyuridine) analog of thymidine before and after IR (see Materials and Methods). Before 10 Gy irradiation non-pretreated wild-type and 0.4 Gy LDR-pretreated larvae exhibited a similar proportion of nuclei (~13%; n = ~2000 cells) that were actively replicating their DNA and incorporated EdU. However after irradiation whereas in non-pretreated wild-type brains the frequency of EdU-labeled nuclei dropped to ~6.5% (as a consequence of the arrest of S phase) 0.4 Gy LDR-pretreated brains displayed a proportion of positive nuclei (~20%; n = ~2000 cells) very similar to unirradiated larvae (Fig. 2c). Based on the EdU incorporation pattern according to Cenci et al. 201522 we subdivided the S phase in three subclasses namely S 1 (early/mid S; nucleus partially or completely stained with the exception of the chromocenter) S 2 (mid/late S; staining at the chromocenter and at a less compacted nuclear area) and S 3 (late S; only chromocenter stained; Fig. 2b). This classification revealed us that pretreated and non-pretreated cells did not differ in the relative frequencies of nuclei showing S 1  S 2 and S 3 EdU incorporation patterns (Fig. 2d). Altogether these results indicate that 0.4 Gy LDR-pretreated cells recover much faster than non-pretreated controls from the DNA damage-induced replication block.

The RAR to chromosome aberrations relies on a more efficient DNA damage response

To determine whether the reduction of chromosome breaks promoted by 0.4 Gy LDR depends on the presence of proteins required for specific DSB repair pathways we checked whether 0.4 Gy LDR-pretreated larvae bearing mutations in genes encoding DSB repair master proteins (dATM dRad50 dNbs1 dMre11) HR-specific repair proteins required for resection or homology search and strand invasion (dRad51 Bloom) and NHEJ-specific proteins (ligase IV Ku70) elicited a decrease of CBs frequency after the challenging dose. The analysis of mitotic chromosomes from all mutants revealed no significant difference (p < 0.05) in the frequency of CBs between 0.4 Gy LDR-pretreated and non-pretreated larvae indicating that the 0.4 Gy LDR-mediated resistance to Œ≥-ray-induced CBs is strictly dependent on DNA repair genes (Fig. 2e).

We then verified whether 0.4 Gy LDR affects the kinetics of Œ≥H2Av recruitment to chromatin breaks. H2Av is the functional homolog of H2AX in Drosophila and its phosphorylation at Ser147 is induced by DSBs23. 0.4 Gy LDR -pretreated and non-pretreated larvae were exposed to 10 Gy Œ≥ rays and then checked by IF for the presence of Œ≥H2Av foci in larval neuroblasts (Fig. 3a) after 5 min 15 min 30 min and 60 min PIR. We found that in non-pretreated control larval brains the number of Œ≥H2Av foci/cell progressively increased over the time reached the highest peak (6 foci/cell) at 30 min PIR and started to slowly decrease at 60 min PIR (Fig. 3b). LDR -pretreated neuroblasts also showed a progressive increment of the Œ≥H2Av foci/cell frequency over the time with a peak at 30 min PIR. Interestingly the average of foci/cell at 30 min was around ~4 indicating that differently from non-pretreated controls LDR-pretreated brains accumulate less damage most likely as the results of either an accelerated DNA damage response or a more efficient DNA repair (Fig. 3b). We have also analyzed the kinetics of Œ≥H2Av accumulation by WB and found that consistently with our IF results at 30 min PIR Œ≥H2Av in 0.4 Gy LDR-pretreated cells does not accumulate as robustly as in non-pretreated cells (Fig. 3cd; see Supplementary Fig. 5 for unprocessed blot images) confirming that 0.4 Gy LDR could accelerate the completion of the DNA damage response. We also analyzed the levels of the MRN complex as well as of Ku70 in both pretreated and non-pretreated cell extracts. WB analyses revealed a statistically significant increase of Rad50 and Nbs1 but not of Ku70 protein levels in 0.4 Gy LDR-pretreated cells with respect to non-pretreated cells (Fig. 3e f; see Supplementary Fig. 6 for unprocessed blot images). Collectively these data along with the genetic analyses indicating a strict requirement of DNA repair genes suggest that the RAR relies on an efficient DNA damage response. However we cannot rule out the possibility that the LDR could also influence chromatin compaction making it more reluctant to damage or more accessible to DNA repair factors compared to non-pretreated chromatin.

LDR protects chromosomes from telomere dysfunction

We also asked whether other DNA damage-induced events are also affected by LDR. We focused on DNA damage response elicited by dysfunctional telomeres and verified the occurrence of telomere fusions (TFs) in mutants with a defective telomere capping. Depletion of either terminin complex components and/or terminin-associated factors induces the formation of multicentric linear and ring chromosomes very likely because of NHEJ-mediated fusion events that occur at uncapped telomeres2425 (for examples of TFs see Fig. 4a). We thus measured the frequency of TFs of 0.4 Gy LDR-pretreated mutants in selected genes coding for telomere capping proteins such as verrocchio (ver) and caravaggio (cav) that specify the terminin proteins VER and HP1-ORC-Associated Protein (HOAP) or Su(var)205 pendolino (peo) and effete (eff) that encode the non terminin protein Heterochromatin Protein 1a (HP1) Peo and UbcD1 respectively2425. As indicated in Fig. 4b we found that in all mutants analyzed 0.4 Gy LDR yielded a relevant reduction of TFs indicating that this exposure exerts a protective effect at uncapped chromosome ends. We have also analyzed the frequency of TFs caused by mutations in tefu nbs rad50 and mre11 genes encoding for the DNA repair factors ATM Nbs Rad50 and Mre11 respectively and which are also required for protecting telomeres from fusion events2627. Interestingly we found that the frequency of TFs in DNA repair mutants was indistinguishable from that of non-pretreated mutants (Fig. 4b) indicating that similarly to RAR the 0.4 Gy LDR-induced telomere protection depends on DNA repair factors. However the reduction of TFs did not always correlate with a reduction of Œ≥H2Av-positive Telomere Induced Foci (TIF) indicating that unlike chromosomal DSBs the reduction of fusigenic feature or uncapped telomeres does not have a direct effect on the cytological detection of telomere damage (Supplementary Fig. 7a b). We finally checked if LDR could induce an increase of retro-transposition of the telomeric retroelement HeT-A as it occurred in flies that were chronically exposed to sub-lethal doses of paraquat28. RT-qPCR analysis revealed no differences in the HeT-A expression between non-pretreated and 0.4 Gy LDR treated TF mutants (Supplementary Fig. 7c) indicating that the 0.4 Gy LDR protective effect on uncapped telomeres is unlikely due to an adaptive role of telomere elongation against the loss of capping.

Differential gene expression and genetic analyses reveal loquacious (Loqs) as a RAR responsive factor

To assess whether the 0.4 Gy LDR RAR was accompanied by differential modulation of specific set of genes we performed a genome wide RNA-seq analysis of total RNAs extracted from unirradiated (NT) 10Gy- 0.4 Gy LDR- and 0.4 Gy LDR + 10Gy-irradiated larval male brains. We decided to focus our transcriptomic analyses on males to avoid the confounding effects of gene expression variability of females which is known to be affected by dietary conditions during development and associated to investment into reproduction-related processes2930. To search for gene functions specifically associated to the chromosome break phenotype RNAs of 10Gy- and 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy irradiated larvae were extracted from brains dissected after 4 h following the acute dose exposure. Pairwise comparisons revealed that the 0.4 Gy LDR treatment per se has not determined a statistically significant modulation of general levels of transcripts compared to the unirradiated condition. In contrast both 10Gy- and 0.4 Gy LDR + 10Gy-treatments yielded a moderate yet statistically significant modulation of transcription in all comparisons (see Supplementary Data 1‚Äì5 for a list of both upregulated and downregulated genes). The Venn diagram including all differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy vs. 10 Gy 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy vs. 0.4 Gy LDR and 10 Gy vs. 0.4 Gy LDR comparisons has shown only a small number of genes in common among all comparisons (Fig. 5a). To further identify genes potentially involved in the RAR we focused on the set of DEGs found in the 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy vs. 10 Gy comparison. DAVID functional enrichment analysis (EASE score < 0.05 Adjusted p < 0.05) revealed that the DEGs from this comparison are involved in RNA processing (see Heat Map of Fig. 5b; Supplementary Data 6). 3 genes (l(3)72Ab CG5205 and CG8064) were also differentially expressed in the 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy vs 0.4 Gy LDR comparison.

Among these unique genes we have drawn our attention to the modulation of loqs (loquacious) transcripts that encode the dsRNA binding protein Loqs which is required for siRNA and micro-RNA biogenesis and that is the fly homolog of mammal TRBP3132. Four different transcripts have been identified for loqs (loqs-RA loqs-RB loqs-RC and loqs-RD) that give rise to the Loqs-PA Loqs-PB Loqs -PC and Loqs ‚ÄìPD isoforms respectively. Loqs PA and Loqs PB both harbor three dsRBDs (L1 L2 L3) while Loqs PC and PD both lack the third dsRBD and instead have short aa stretches at their C-termini. Loqs-PA and Loqs-PB interact with Dcr-1 during miRNA biogenesis32333435. Loqs-PC is rarely expressed and has no known function32 while Loqs-PD facilitates Dcr-2‚Äìdependent endosiRNA biogenesis3233. Our RNA-Seq experiment showed that the loqs-RD (but not the other transcripts) appeared ~2 fold decreased in 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy samples compared to 10 Gy irradiated samples. This reduction was also validated by RT-qPCR on three independent RNA extractions (Fig. 6a) suggesting that LDR could specifically influence Loqs-dependent esi-RNA biogenesis. Consistent with this we found that 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy larvae showed a statistically significant increase of mus308 transcripts that are the endogenous targets of esi-1 RNA36 with respect to both unirradiated and 10 Gy irradiated larvae (Fig. 6a).

Fig. 6: Loqs as a RAR responsive factor. a RT-qPCR on different Loqs splicing variants and mus308. Loqs-RD (but not -RB -RA and -RE) transcripts are downregulated in 0.4 Gy LDR exposed male brains following the exposure to 10 Gy while mus308 transcripts are upregulated. Three different experiments were performed.

To further understand whether the reduction of Loqs indeed accounts for the RAR we analyzed chromosome integrity in chronically irradiated Loqs-depleted larval brain cells with and without the 0.4 Gy LDR-treatment. We thus measured the frequencies of CBs in the loqsKO null mutant upon 0.4 Gy LDR 10 Gy and 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy treatments as well as in unirradiated loqsKO brains using the same experimental set up described above. Intriguingly we found that while unirradiated loqsKO larval brain cells exhibited very rare CBs the frequency of CBs in this mutant was >50% reduced with respect to Or-R control larvae (n = 250) after the exposure to 10 Gy (Fig. 6d). This suggests that the depletion of Loqs could mimic the effect of the 0.4 Gy LDR priming dose in determining resistance to ionizing radiation-induced CBs. Interestingly we observed that this response was lost when Loqs-PD but not ‚ÄìPB was expressed in the loqsKO null mutant (Fig. 6d) confirming that only the reduction of this specific isoform is involved in triggering radio-resistance to CBs. However we observed that the >50% reduction of CB frequency in 10 Gy irradiated loqsKO null mutant did not further decrease upon the 0.4 Gy LDR pretreatment suggesting that the effect of Loqs loss on the radio-resistance is epistatic over the 0.4 Gy (2.5mGy/h) LDR priming dose (Fig. 6d). Finally we observed a ~50% reduction of CBs also in loqsKO/+ heterozygotes suggesting that radioresistance effect is dominant and confirming our RNA-seq data that even a moderate downregulation of this gene can account for the protection against extensive DNA breakage.

To confirm that the loss of Loqs mirrors the effects of the 0.4 Gy LDR -induced radio-resistance we first verified whether the response to CBs in Loqs-depleted cells is also dependent on DNA repair factors. We thus sought to analyze CB frequency in loqsKO; tefuatm and loqsKO; nbs1 double mutants. While loqsKO; tefuatm double mutants turned out to be early lethal thus preventing us for a further characterization we found that the frequency of CBs in 2 Gy irradiated loqsKO; nbs1 larvae was similar to that of 2 Gy irradiated nbs1 single mutants (Supplementary Table 2) confirming that the protection from chromosome breakage in Loqs-depleted and 0.4 Gy LDR cells requires shared DNA protein factors. Finally we observed that the kinetics of Œ≥H2Av recruitment and the response to production of ROS in loqsKO and in 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy cells were similar (Fig. 6e; Supplementary Fig. 4). Altogether this set of evidences confirms that repression of Loqs explains the LDR-mediated RAR and endorses the view that Loqs-PD is a bona fide low dose responsive gene.

Loss of Loqs reduces the frequency of Telomere Fusions in Drosophila telomere capping mutants

We then sought to verify if a reduction of Loqs similarly to LDR affects the fusigenic ability of chromosomes with defective telomere capping. We thus checked the frequency of TFs in double mutant combinations between loqsKO and TF mutants (ver1 cav1 nbs1) mapping on the third chromosome and therefore more suitable for recombination with loqsKO located on the second chromosome. Very interestingly we found that in loqsKO; ver1 and loqsKO; cav1 mutant combinations the percentage of TFs/cell was substantially lower than that observed in the corresponding controls while as expected TF frequency of nbs1 mutants was not affected by loss of Loqs (Fig. 6f). This finding further confirms that similarly to RAR the reduction of Loqs is also involved in the protection of uncapped telomeres.",,,,,,,,,

I‚Äôm at Burning Man and I feel like a kid again. The reason for this transmission is to tell you why.

Black Rock City a sprawling sandbox of stimuli on a planet called playa is a place entirely new to me but the inhabitants here say the only way to explore it is by bicycle.

The bicycle they told me is the main mode of transportation at Burning Man this planet‚Äôs yearly gathering of 80000 burners from far-flung corners of Earth a land much different than this one.

Here the people live in large camps named for the natures intentions and imaginations of the inhabitants there. There‚Äôs Run Free where the burners are clean and sober and find ways to explore Black Rock City without substances that turn the world into a lysergic candy-colored dreamscape. There‚Äôs Dustfish where desert angels sing of acid and hot springs. And among hundreds of others there‚Äôs Journeylizm a camp of artists scientists and journalists here to document another burn. They have adopted me. While I am here this is my home.

I have brought very little from my home planet to Black Rock City: Food water and camp gear to last 10 days in a hot dusty unforgiving place where people are not meant to live. But I have learned it is the red and cream cruiser with red and rainbow wheels that is most vital to experiencing this planet called playa.

The cruiser is not my own. It was loaned to me by Choco Taco the tough mamma burner who explored the playa long before me ‚Äì‚Äì the burner without a name.

On my first night in Black Rock City I activated my red and rainbow wheels mounted the cruiser and pushed off into the dust.

What follows in the remainder of this transmission is a collection of lessons and discoveries I learned and documented atop a bicycle over the course of eight days at Burning Man.

Lesson One: Riding a bicycle in a dress is challenging

Where I come from men don‚Äôt wear dresses. And that‚Äôs unfortunate. I‚Äôm wearing one right now as I type this transmission and it is quite comfortable ‚Äì‚Äì especially in a place like Black Rock City. There‚Äôs more room there‚Äôs more cover from the sun there‚Äôs no one judging you. And of course there‚Äôs that miraculous breeze that comes from under the bicycle when it seems you need it most.

But dear reader I must tell you: It is not easy riding a bicycle in a dress. The first night I wore one on the playa I failed to bunch up the fabric and pull it far enough over my knee to clear my leg over the seat and mount the bicycle. Down I went like a sack of hot garbage but I dusted myself off and tried again. Later I let the dress fall too low and soon the teeth of the sprocket bit into the fabric demanding a full stop wiggle and reset to get rolling. Dresses demand respect and practice ‚Äì‚Äì well worth it to feel that breeze.

Lesson Two: Fast Travel

There is a time and place for exploring Black Rock City by foot. But for most travel situations the bicycle is ideal. During the day when temperatures shoot past the 90s and into the 100s the bicycle is vital. For one travel beneath the hard hot sun is faster. A journey that may take 20 minutes by bicycle may take over an hour by foot. Second this speedy travel grants access to analog air conditioning: The wind.

Lesson Three: Carrying Capacity

The first two nights on the playa were plagued by the worst dust storms at Burning Man in years. That made it necessary to pack the right equipment in case you ran into a dust devil with Dorothy still in it. Goggles to protect the eyes and a shawl to cover the mouth were part of my riding gear. Carrying all that on the body ‚Äì‚Äì along with a camp cup lock notebook and water supply ‚Äì‚Äì would be difficult without the aid of a basket. All that extra weight would cause further discomfort in an already uncomfortable environment.

Lesson Four: Exploration is enhanced

Exploring foreign lands is much more magical on a bicycle. That‚Äôs especially true at Burning Man. At sundown when burners howl to celebrate the coming of night the world takes on a carnival of the cosmos vibration. Flames explode into the sky. Vehicles shaped like pirate ships deep sea creatures and intergalactic monsters sail and swim and claw through dust that rapidly changes from a golden haze to a dense fog.

Under the metal bars of the Thunderdome burners compete in trapeze club battles while men and women in leather bark of violence and spectators hanging above make bets. In the dark of the playa rise up epic structures of light and sound. There is too much to see at Burning Man and there is no way to see it all. Well except one: Get on your bicycle find the 100-foot rocket tower ascend four sets of rickety ladders to the very top and look out at the psychedelic horizon. Somehow it will all seem smaller ‚Äì conquerable. The sight produced in me a boost of bravery to climb down the ladders pull my dress far enough over my leg to mount the cruiser with ease and launch back into the mysterious expanse of the playa.

Lesson Five: Breakdowns are imminent

With each day that expires before the burn the playa dust gets thicker and thicker. Deep ruts and heavy bumps may eventually send the contents of your basket crashing to the dirt forcing you to dismount and collect. Late in the week breakdowns are more likely to happen. By then the dust has had many days to infiltrate every corner of your being ‚Äì‚Äì several of those corners being unmentionable in this transmission.

On my eighth day in Black Rock City playa dust caked in the ball bearings of the cruiser‚Äôs chain ring and locked up the pedals. There are bicycle camps at Burning Man ready and available to help with repairs. But I had failed to bring my map that day and the closest suggestion of a passing burner was too far to walk in the 102-degree heat with a dwindling water supply. I walked back to camp. In the shade I knocked loose the caked dust by pounding the crank arms with the palm of my hand and gently bouncing the tires off the ground. With the chain ring teeth freed to bite the chain I slicked the bearings with WD-40 and cranked the wheels until the tires spun in a smooth whir.

Lesson Six: Bicycling with intentions to walk

An earlier portion of this transmission described the benefits of fast travel. But there are also advantages to securing the bicycle to a rack in a desirable location and setting off on foot. The benefits of slow travel have to do with discovery and connectivity. On a bicycle feeling like you have to get somewhere you may pass up the robot wheeling its way to camp. On foot you may shake that robot‚Äôs hand ask whether it knows Johnny 5 and get this response: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not alive!‚Äù

On a bicycle the rattle of the basket and squeak of the chain may keep you from hearing the ethereal guitars of Miles Davis‚Äô ‚ÄúIn a Silent Way‚Äù on a night when the stars look so low you could pluck them out of the sky. On foot you may notice the 8-foot telescope beneath the rotating dome look into the eyepiece see the rings of Saturn craters of the moon.

Lesson Seven: You will be transported ‚Äì somewhere

The red and cream cruiser with the red and rainbow wheels has a transporting effect. But not in the sense that it transports you from point A to point B and back again. The effect I‚Äôm talking about somehow transported me back in time. This time travel glitch did not alter the physical world around me but it without a doubt shifted the emotional realm within me.

Flying through the playa dust on the red and cream cruiser with the red and rainbow wheels I returned to a time of potent courage and discovery I had not experienced since I was a child on my home planet. On the cruiser wonder returned. Awe guided the direction of my handlebars. Curiosity compelled me to get lost. I realized I had no responsibility other than finding my own way.

This sandbox freedom reconnected me to a time long long ago when I pedaled my silver trick bike with gumball blue pegs down sidewalks illuminated streetlamp yellow imagining that ‚Äì‚Äì if I could just pedal fast enough ‚Äì‚Äì the fabric of that reality could tear and I could slip into a portal to a new reality of light and sound and color. And that feeling I discovered is what Burning Man on a bicycle is all about. Riding the red and cream cruiser dust trailing the red and rainbow wheels like rocket smoke I felt like a kid again ‚Äì‚Äì like I could lift up and off the playa and through the dust and into the stars to a new galaxy far from the one I call home.

End of Transmission",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzczYTY1MjdkLWNkNTktNDk4ZS05OTIzLWFmNTE0M2NiYjk1MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How passive are markets actually?,"Print this page

How much of the stock market is owned by passive investors such as index funds? The answer is a lot more complicated than you might think but some academics have had a good stab at finding out.

But first let‚Äôs back up a little. The ‚Äúofficial‚Äù number often used is the amount of money in index funds ‚Äî whether traditional mutual fund structures or exchange traded funds. Morningstar estimates that was $9.5tn in ETFs and $7.3tn in index mutual funds at the end of 2021 which has since slid to $8.6tn and $6.4tn respectively by the end of July.

Of course not all index funds invest just in stocks. The bond market has seen an explosion of index funds lately. Nor are index funds actually all truly ‚Äúpassive‚Äù in that they slavishly track a plain vanilla market benchmark. ETFs especially tend to be used in very active ways or package up active strategies.

Is a factor-tilt fund truly passive even if the investment process is systematic? When a hedge fund bets on gold mining stocks through an ETF focused on the field is that actually passive? Surely calling a leveraged inverse Vix-linked ETF a passive investor sounds a bit mad.

Still the vast majority of the money is in ‚Äúclassic‚Äù cheap market cap-weighted passive index funds so it is a decent shorthand for the size of the industry. Here is Morningstar‚Äôs data in chart format.

As a percentage of the overall $42tn open-ended investment fund market tracked by Morningstar the passive share has more than doubled from 16.8 per cent in 2012 to about 35 per cent today (NB highlighting how messy the data can be the Investment Company Institute estimates that the global open-ended fund total is actually over $71tn which would equate to a passive share of 23 per cent).

However people often forget that open-ended investment funds only hold a slice of markets and conflate passive‚Äôs mutual fund industry market share with its overall market ownership.

For example when the passive share of the US fund industry first tipped over 50 per cent in 2019 it caused a lot wailing from people that either didn‚Äôt realise (or ignored the fact) that this was only half the equity mutual fund world ‚Äî in other words excluding investors like hedge funds pension plans and ordinary Americans.

As a percentage of the global stock market ‚Äî which Sifma estimates at $124.4tn at the end of 2021 ‚Äî the $13.3tn of equity index funds and ETFs at the time accounted for about a tenth. If we zoom in on the US the ICI estimates that passive funds held about 16 per cent of the entire US stock market.

However the reality is that a lot of investors invest passively but do so outside the public universe of index funds and ETFs that we can see. Many big institutional investors hand bespoke index-mimicking mandates to the likes of BlackRock State Street or Vanguard which don‚Äôt appear in the formal index fund data.

The sums can be huge. As an example at the end of June BlackRock had $2.6tn in passive institutional mandates almost as much as the $2.7tn it has in its industry-leading iShares ETF franchise.

That is not all. The reality is that tracking major stock market indices like the S&P 500 is so simple these days that some major institutions ‚Äî for example the larger sovereign wealth funds or pension plans ‚Äî can do it in-house.

Getting a grip on the size of this ‚Äúshadow indexing‚Äù is tricky but back in October 2017 BlackRock estimated that there was another $5.4tn in institutional mandates globally plus $1.4tn in internal index strategies.

Back then BlackRock estimated that 17.5 per cent of the global equity market was held in passive investment strategies compared to 25.6 per cent in active ones and the balance held directly by pension plans insurance companies individuals other companies etc.

NB 2017 numbers

BlackRock has not publicly updated its numbers since then (presumably because of the growing backlash against index strategies). Using the growth of the public index fund universe you can extrapolate from those 2017 numbers to get a very dirty estimate for the overall passive universe today but the reality is that there are too many assumptions to feel entirely comfortable with it.

However a paper published in July (which we only saw recently thanks to Wes Gray) by Alex Chinco of Baruch College and Marco Sammon of Harvard Business School has come up with a neat way to get a more rigorous estimate.

It‚Äôs a BIG one.

They reckon that passive investors held at least 37.8 per cent of the US stock market in 2020 ‚Äî more than twice the semi-official size estimated by the Investment Company Institute (which is derived from the size of the index fund universe).

As the chart indicates Chinco and Sammon get their estimate from crunching the data on the trading spikes triggered by regular rejigging of big indices like the S&P 500 the Russell 1000 and the Russell 2000.

When a company is added or ditched from an index most index-replicating investors rebalance immediately prior to the close of trading on the day the change comes into effect. From the spurt of trading on regular index ‚Äúreconstitution‚Äù days the economists came up with an estimate for the total amount of money that replicates the indices they looked at. It‚Äôs not perfect but it should be a decent way of gauging the heft of all de facto index-mimicking strategies.

Yet the two economists reckon that even their 37.8 per cent estimate is ‚Äúalmost certainly too low‚Äù as not all passive investors slavishly rebalance on index rebalancing days and they didn‚Äôt look at other popular indices like the Nasdaq.

To ensure that the trading volume we analyze comes from index rebalancing we narrowly focus on just the trading volume experienced by adds and drops right at market close on reconstitution days. But not all passive investors are strict end-of-day indexers. In principle some passive investors could rebalance more slowly. And our approach does not reflect the holdings of these more relaxed passive investors. This is one reason why 37.8% is a lower bound. Another reason is that it only reflects the holdings of strict end-of-day indexers who are benchmarked to either the S&P 500 the Russell 1000 or the Russell 2000. While these are important indexes they are not the only indexes. The holdings of a strict end-of-day indexer who is benchmarked to the Nasdaq 100 for example is not captured by our 37.8% headline number

This meshes with BlackRock‚Äôs own 2017 estimates which indicated that institutional and internal indexing was more than twice the size of the ‚Äúpublic‚Äù index fund universe.

How big a problem is the fact that passive investing is even bigger than commonly thought?

Chinco and Sammon think it is a big deal that the traditional data on passive ownership is likely off by a factor of two arguing that ‚Äúthe size of this blind spot poses a real problem for anyone trying to use these models to make policy decisions‚Äù.

A host of people will probably agree having gnashed their teeth at the irresistible growth of passive investing in recent years. Back in 2017 Elliott Management‚Äôs Paul Singer memorably described it as ‚Äúa blob‚Äù that was ‚Äúin danger of devouring capitalism‚Äù. Here‚Äôs an excerpt from his letter to investors dealing with the phenomenon:

There is nothing ethically wrong or indefensible in running a mega-shop focusing on passive investing nor do passive investors have an obligation to overcome or counteract the adverse trends that have been discussed in this piece (although they should care). We believe however that there is a fallacy of composition and that what may have been a clever idea in its infancy has grown into a blob which is destructive to the growth-creating and consensus-building prospects of free-market capitalism. This ‚Äúovergrowth‚Äù is a drag on the power of capitalism to adapt to continually strive for excellence efficiency and creativity and to deliver goods and services for citizens in the manner in which it has done for the last couple of centuries. In effect therefore it is dangerous ultimately divisive and may be an important reason the pro-freedom or pro-capitalism consensus dissipates over time.

Is it really that dangerous though? Setting aside issues around the mounting concentration of corporate power the fact is that passive investing is much bigger than commonly thought and yet there is to our eyes very little evidence that the overall efficiency of markets has deteriorated as a result. That it‚Äôs harder and harder to beat the averages implies that markets are getting more efficient overall not less.

Sure the rise of passive investing is unquestionably having an impact on financial markets. How could it not? But is it really that much more malign than other forms of investing? That seems questionable when stacked up against the benefits for investors everywhere.

The harsh reality is that the investment industry as a whole makes a staggering amount of money ‚Äî listed US asset managers had an average profit margin of almost 26 per cent in 2021 more than twice the S&P 500‚Äôs average ‚Äî and yet do a bad job on average. Despite the march of passive over the decades there are still more mutual and hedge fund managers than ever before many of which in practice do little more than extract rents from the financial system.

But this is clearly such a monumental shift that someone should really write a book about it. Oh wait . . .",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdHJ1dGhvdXQub3JnL2FydGljbGVzL3BhcmVudC1wYXJ0aWNpcGF0aW9uLWluLWNsaW1hdGUtanVzdGljZS1lZmZvcnRzLWlzLW9uLXRoZS1yaXNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Parent Participation in Climate Justice Efforts Is on the Rise,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='truthout.org', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/parent-participation-in-climate-justice-efforts-is-on-the-rise/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016710FCC550>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdHJ1dGhvdXQub3JnL2FydGljbGVzL3BhcmVudC1wYXJ0aWNpcGF0aW9uLWluLWNsaW1hdGUtanVzdGljZS1lZmZvcnRzLWlzLW9uLXRoZS1yaXNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNoZXhhbWluZXIuY29tL3Byb3BlcnR5L3Jlc2lkZW50aWFsL2FyaWQtNDA5NTMyMzAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Quick return to market for this ‚Ç¨449000 semi-detached home,"A development aimed at first-time buyers three years ago with what were billed as ‚Äòsweet-spot‚Äô prices from ‚Ç¨325000 to ‚Ç¨365000 has seen one of the first resale offers come to market.

But now in 2022 the four-bed semi-d has got an asking of price ‚Ç¨100000 or 28% more than the same house sold for new in 2019.

Listed with a ‚Ç¨449000 AMV is 1 Lakelands Gardens in the sold-out Crawford gate scheme of 65 homes in Cork‚Äôs Skehard/Blackrock/Mahon hinterland in ‚Äòas new‚Äô condition ‚Äî ‚Äúit‚Äôs the closest thing I‚Äôve seen to a formal showhouse‚Äù says auctioneer Jeremy Murphy who‚Äôs acting for a Cork couple already set to trade up from their 1284 sq ft home.

The Price Register shows 60 listings at Crawford Gate including several multiples and No 1 shows at ‚Ç¨349500 as a 2019 deal recorded in February 2020 making some ‚Ç¨20000 over the original sale prices of three-bed semis there as a larger and four-bed home.

Today at the ‚Ç¨449000 AMV it shows just how strong the market has been since ‚Äî and how much harder it is for first-time buyers to afford to buy as the purchasing goalposts have moved steadily out of reach for so many.

If the same 28% rise in values is applied to the three-bed semi-ds in Crawford Gate another resale offer here could be expected to float at ‚Ç¨415000 up ‚Ç¨90000 from the three-bed originals‚Äô ‚Ç¨325000 sale price when new.

Just two Crawford Gate houses show to date at over ‚Ç¨400000 Louisa Court at ‚Ç¨405649 and No 13 Frederick Avenue at ‚Ç¨402598 likely to be the largest 1450 sq ft types and both listed in 2020 in the scheme of 65 three-and four-bed homes off the Skehard Rd and Bessboro.

A mix of terraced and end/semi-detached homes which started on site in late 2018 Crawford Gate was done by DOB developments (a new generation headed by the O‚ÄôBrien family of O‚ÄôBrien and O‚ÄôFlynn house-building tradition) on a 3.8-acre site. It was once home to one of Cork‚Äôs finest houses and estates Lakelands demolished 140 years ago and which was owned by the Crawford family. Their name lives on in the city centre as benefactors of the now-municipal art gallery and owners of the Beamish & Crawford brewery back in the day.

Now rapid price inflation during the past two years of the pandemic has seen unpredicted and frothy growth in the property market nationwide ‚Äî close to 30% in the case of No 1 Lakelands Gardens if it sells for or above the asking price.

Not surprisingly it‚Äôs in walk-in order in a location served by two bus routes the 202 and the 215 and has the Blackrock Greenway running close by too with both Mahon‚Äôs retail and office parks as well as Blackrock village within a walk.

It has a front reception room rear kitchen/diner guest WC and utility and four compact first floor bedrooms (one with en suite shower room) and a main bathroom with shower over the bath.

The enclosed back garden has an Astroturf finish and BER-wise it‚Äôs A3 rated so will be easy to power and heat a bonus for buyers once they can afford the purchase price.

Buyers may have the option to rent a room or two for income support up to a current maximum of ‚Ç¨14000 tax-free under the Rent a Room scheme. However first-time buyers will not be able to avail of the Help to Buy scheme or of the newly introduced Shared Equity Scheme as No 1 Lakelands Gardens is now a second-hand property.

VERDICT: Some 200 people mostly first-time buyers queued to inspect Crawford Gate houses in 2019 on their launch. The buyer catchment will be far smaller now given the rise in values and prices since.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJnai5jb20vc3RvcnkvbGlmZS9hcnRzL2J1cm5pbmctbWFuLzIwMjIvMDkvMDMvYnVybmluZy1tYW4tMjAyMi1lZmZpZ3ktc3RhdHVlLW5ldmFkYS1ibGFjay1yb2NrLWRlc2VydC83OTY1Njg1MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Check out how the Burning Man effigy has changed over the years,"After seven days of celebration and debauchery in the Black Rock Desert Burning Man 2022 will reach the much-anticipated igniting of the neon green effigy Saturday.

The ""Waking Dreams"" iteration of the Man will be the 37th burned since the very first in 1986 ‚Äì including one virtual and one broadcast ‚Äì and the wooden giant has gone through quite the evolution.

See how the Man has changed throughout the years:

1986

Theme: N/A

The very first Burning Man didn't take place in Black Rock City but rather in Baker Beach in San Francisco with a crowd of 35 that pales in comparison to today's tens of thousands of burners.

Yet standing at just 8 feet tall the fiery sculpture would make history.

1989

Theme: N/A

Over the course of three years the Man grew to 15 30 and 40 feet in 1989. As the statue grew so did the crowds as 300 watched it erupt in flames on Baker Beach.

It didn't go off without a hitch though as the Man's legs and pelvis snapped as it was assembled burning in a semi-awkward position.

2001

Theme: Seven Ages

Fifteen years later after the very first Burning Man the 2001 version is far past the event's humble beginnings. More than 25000 people were in attendance during the eight-day event in Black Rock City where Burning Man started calling home in 1990.

This Man stood at 40 feet boosted on a 30-foot platform called the ""Temple of Wisdom."" The body was outlined in blue neon with the inside green blue and purple neon on the head.

2010

Theme: Metropolis

Burning Man reached new heights in 2010 ‚Äì literally as the Man stood tall at 40 feet on top of a 64-foot pavilion for a combined total of 104 feet the second highest in Burning Man history.

Over 51000 people came to be a part of the 2010 event the biggest crowd yet for Burning Man following a slight dip in attendance in 2009 following the nation's economic downturn.

2014

Theme: Caravansary

2014's Man is the tallest in the event's history tied with 2017's at 105 feet except this Man doesn't have a platform or podium to boost its height ‚Äì it towers with its feet planted on the playa floor.

Nearly 66000 attended the burn a slight decrease from the year prior.

2019

Theme: Metamorphoses

The 2019 edition of Burning Man would be the last (official) in-person Man until 2022's.

2019's effigy may not have reached the heights of years prior standing at 61 feet but it still sported an intricate design. 2019 was the first year without Burning Man co-founder and designer Larry Harvey who died in 2018; carrying on the Burning Man tradition were Yelena Filipchuk and Serge Beaulieu who designed the Man Pavillion.

'Point of View': See Filipchuck and Beaulieu's work at Burning Man 2022

Just fewer than 79000 attended the largest population in Burning Man history by a few thousand.

2022

Theme: Waking Dreams

This year's Burning Man has a lot to live up to with nearly four decades of history. The time-honored tradition has evolved to towering heights attracted a city's worth of fans and endured the country's financial woes as well as a worldwide pandemic.

The past two years alone it experienced a virtual burning in 2020 and a broadcast one in 2021 as well as an unofficial gathering.

The clock is ticking until the Man meets its fiery fate Saturday night but for now it stands tall in the footsteps of the Men of the past.

The carrier initially planned to retire the fleet by 2025 but has since decided to keep them longer.

While the planes wait for retirement Delta has upgraded 19 of its -300ER models ‚Äî see what it's like.

The carrier's first 767 was delivered in 1982 and over the years Delta has flown all four types including the 767-200 767-300 767-300ER and the 767-400ER.

During the pandemic the airline said it planned to retire the aging widebodies by 2025 but went back on that late last year saying it wanted to be flexible on the timeline.

""It's hard enough to say what we'll be flying in January let alone what we'll be flying in 2027"" Delta President Glen Hauenstein said during a November 2021 pilot webinar per Airline Weekly. ""You don't want to get yourself in a box where you've committed specifically to flying or retiring those planes.""

While Delta does eventually plan to retire its 767 fleet the carrier has retrofitted 19 of the -300ER models in the meantime.

The new layout dubbed ""76K"" includes a brand-new Premium Select cabin and a few upgrades to its Delta One and economy sections like adding LED lights and power ports to coach.

Premium Select is Delta's upgraded cabin that offers a leg rest and bigger seatback screens compared to Comfort+ among other amenities. The product is currently on the carrier's Airbus A350s A330neos and Boeing 767-400ERs.

Although Delta's 767's have an average age of 25 years the retrofits suggest the airline still sees a place for them in its fleet and has trust in the jet's reliability and performance.

I flew on one of Delta's Boeing 767-300ER aircraft on a recent trip from Stockholm to New York City ‚Äî here's what it was like.

Flying on Delta's Boeing 767-300ER. Taylor Rains/Insider

My trip started at Terminal 5 in Sweden's Stockholm Arlanda Airport at 9:00 a.m. for my 12:05 p.m. flight.

The day before I tried to check-in online but the Delta app told me I needed to check in at the ticket counter due to ""government regulations.""

Screenshot of my Delta app when I tried to check in. Taylor Rains/Insider

In line there were signs reminding non-US citizens and nonimmigrants that they need to submit a ""health attestation form"" before the flight saying they are fully vaccinated or have an exemption.

There were also security agents who checked my passport and asked detailed questions about my trip to Sweden like where I stayed and my occupation. I travel to the US from Europe frequently and this is the first time I've gotten this type of questioning.

We were questioned while we waiting in line to check in. Taylor Rains/Insider

After waiting about 20 minutes I made it to the agent. She checked my passport for a second time and issued my boarding pass. I noticed I was assigned seat 49D meaning I was in the middle seat of the middle section.

While I was a little disappointed in the random seat I knew it was a gamble when booking basic economy.

After check-in I headed to security which only took about 15 minutes. I was happy to see the chaos happening at airports like London Heathrow and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol was absent from Arlanda.

After security I made my way through the airport passing through a large duty-free area before heading to gate 17.

The duty free area was not crowded. Taylor Rains/Insider

The gate was actually in a secure area just past a passport control checkpoint where my document was checked for the third time.

Flying on Delta's Boeing 767-300ER. Taylor Rains/Insider

Once in the boarding area my boarding pass was checked by another agent who pointed out the dreaded SSSS written across the top meaning I had to wait in another line to get a secondary security check.

After about 10 minutes of waiting in line and another 10 minutes of swabbing my bags I was finally able to wait by the gate.

I was the last to board which was no big deal.

Walking through the plane I passed both Delta One and Premium Select and noticed how nice the ""76K"" version of the Boeing 767-300ER was. The seats were plush and the jet felt much newer than 20 years old.

Delta One. Taylor Rains/Insider

However Delta One was not the new suite product installed on the carrier's 767-400ER but it still had new finishes and better cushions than the previous design.

Moreover the 2x3x2 layout means couples sitting on the sides get a row to themselves.

I quickly got to my seat and stored my luggage. Like other 767s I've flown on the overhead bins closest to the fuselage are meant for roller bags while the middle ones are smaller and better suited for duffels and backpacks.

My carry-on suitcase easily fit in the larger bin.

When I took my seat I was happy to find a large water bottle‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶and a pillow and blanket waiting for me.

I was also impressed with how roomy the seat was. At first I was a little nervous about sitting in the middle seat of the middle section but it proved to be perfectly comfortable.

At 5'3"" and on the smaller side I had more than enough legroom for both my feet and my backpack. Delta's 767-300 offers 31-32 inches of pitch so shorter and average-height passengers should have plenty of space.

However taller passengers may want to upgrade to Comfort+ which offers 35 inches of pitch. Both cabins offer 17.9 inches of seat width.

I worked during my flight so I had to rely on the WiFi en route which cost $9.95. At first it was pretty slow during the climb but it sped up at cruising altitude and I didn't have any further problems.

For frequent flyers the monthly global WiFi plan costs $69.95. Taylor Rains/Insider

I was also able to tap into T-Mobile's free inflight WiFi and texting on my phone which was a nice surprise.

About an hour into the flight the flight attendants started the meal service. For lunch we were offered either a veggie ravioli dish or chicken curry. The curry smelled delicious so I went with that.

On my most recent transatlantic flight from London to Montreal on Air Canada I was really disappointed in the food but I was eager to try Delta's.

I flew on Air Canada in economy from London to Montreal and while the Boeing 787 was comfortable the food was a real disappointment

Fortunately the carrier's food was much better and I'd go as far as to say it was actually one of the tastiest economy meals I've had on an airliner. The curry was creamy‚Ä¶

I know the curry looks questionable but it was delicious mixed with the rice. Taylor Rains/Insider

‚Ä¶the caprese salad was a filling side dish‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶and the salted caramel ice cream satisfied my sweet tooth.

Shortly after serving the meals the flight attendants came through with drinks. Alcohol was free in economy so I opted for a Diet Coke and Bacardi.

After the meal I headed to the lavatory which was nothing special but still big enough to change and move around.

There was also a large baby changing table.

Back at my seat I turned on my TV screen and pulled up the flight tracker to have in the background while I worked.

I spent about six hours working which surprisingly flew by despite being trapped in the very middle seat. I didn't feel uncomfortable at all during the flight which goes to show how well Delta has designed its cabin.

The blue mood lights were on during the flight which helped me focus and the flight attendants came by with water and orange juice several times keeping me hydrated.

About an hour before landing passengers were served a second smaller meal. The options were a chicken spring roll or a feta and spinach pastry. I chose the latter to try a vegetarian offering.

Like the first meal I was again not disappointed in the pastry's taste. The texture of the filling is my only critique but it was a very minor issue as the flavor made up for it.

I was also given raspberry yogurt. It was actually better than the yogurt offered on United's transatlantic flights so I was impressed.

I flew on United's aging Boeing 767-300ER from Boston to London in economy and the updated cabin made the plane feel like new

Shortly after collecting the trash we started our final descent into New York and landed right on time.

Deplaning was surprisingly quick. Taylor Rains/Insider

Overall the flight was perfect and probably the best long-haul flight experience I've had in a long time ‚Äî even being in the middle seat.

Delta's upgraded economy cabin was the selling point which now has inflight power mood lighting and memory-foam seat cushions.

Power was previously reserved for Comfort+ and business class so I wouldn't have been able to keep my laptop charged and work for six hours straight without the added amenity.

Moreover the padded reclining seat kept me comfortable during the journey and I didn't have any back or leg pain after landing...

...and the inflight service was wonderful.

I would highly recommend flying Delta's 767-300 long-haul. Despite the old plane the carrier's thoughtful upgrades ensure a smooth comfortable ride.

Ferrari never sold this fellow in the United States due to its carbureted engine which didn‚Äôt comply with emission regulations. Come 1979 the Prancing Horse gifted the four-seat grand tourer with mechanical fuel injection thus giving birth to the 400i.

Offered through 1985 the 400i uses the renowned K-Jetronic system developed by German engineering and technology company Bosch. The first series-production car to feature K-Jetronic is the Porsche 911T and the 400i is Ferrari‚Äôs first-ever production car equipped with this technology.Named this way after the (nearly) 400 cubic centimeters of each cylinder the 400i displaces 4823 cubic centimeters. An evolution of the legendary V12 developed by Gioacchino Colombo in 1947 this lump is codenamed F101 D. At first glance the only difference over the F101 C in the 400 is a letter. On the other hand the D embodies all the changes that Maranello had to make with the adoption of Bosch K-Jetronic mechanical fuel injection.The distributors used by the carbureted 400 were replaced by a single unit and electronic ignition supplied by Magneti Marelli. Considering that Ferrari made the switch to fuel injection for more favorable emissions test results it shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise that the F101 D isn‚Äôt as powerful as the F101 C. 311 ponies and 304 pound-foot (412 Nm) compared to 335 ponies and 347 pound-foot (471 Nm) is a tremendous difference no doubt about it!Just like the 400 the Prancing Horse‚Äôs first production car to be offered with a torque-converter automatic the 400i could be had with a five-speed manual and a three-speed automatic. As a result manuals were sold as the 400i GT and automatics were sold as the 400i A. Even though Ferrari says the automatic tranny is supplied by BorgWarner bear in mind that it's designed by General Motors. The automatic in question is the long-running TH400.Regardless of transmission the gran turismo is rocking a limited-slip differential a self-leveling rear axle power steering telescopic shocks from Koni coil springs unequal-length wishbones and two anti-roll bars. The Italian outfit also provided 15- by 7-inch Cromodora five-spoke alloys Michelin XWX rubber boots ventilated disc brakes and twin fuel tanks.The 2700-millimeter (106.3-inch) wheelbase was the longest of any production car from the Prancing Horse. By comparison the subsequent 456 and 612 boast 4600 mm (102.3 in) and 2950 mm (116.1 in) respectively. Unveiled in 1979 at the Turin Motor Show the most expensive Ferrari of that era uses the tubular steel frames of the 400 before it. The 400i is pretty similar in terms of exterior design too save for the redesigned taillights.Styled by Leonardo Fioravanti at Pininfarina the 400 series is mostly steel in terms of chassis and bodywork. The only exceptions are the aluminum hood and trunk lid. Pop-up headlights and branded mirror caps also need to be mentioned along with leather upholstery air conditioning a radio electric windows and a three-spoke steering wheel that frames a 300-kph speedo.The instrument cluster also consists of a tachometer that goes to 8000 rpm and two centrally-mounted gauges for the oil pressure and water temperature. Where the center console meets the dashboard the 400i presents you with a clock the fuel readout and oil temperature gauge.Tipping the scales at 1830 kilograms (4034 pounds) the fuel-injected sibling is obviously heavier than the 400 . In combination with the poorer output figures the additional weight took its toll on top speed. According to Ferrari the 400i tops 150 miles per hour (241 kilometers per hour) compared to 153 miles per hour (246 kilometers per hour) for the 400.As expected acceleration wasn‚Äôt particularly stellar either. Be that as it may zero-to-60 times aren‚Äôt of the essence. Enzo Ferrari used the 400i as his company car which speaks volumes about how the 400i is meant to be enjoyed. Famous owners also include Welsh actor Richard Burton Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham and Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman.Updated in time for the 1982 Paris Motor Show the 400i was never meant to sell like hot cakes. Enzo-era Ferrari was more into racing than sales volumes and the prohibitive price of the 400i didn‚Äôt help either. A grand total of 1305 units were produced through 1985 of which 833 were specified with the automatic transmission designed by General Motors.Despite its Bosch-sourced injection system the 400i was never sold in the United States on emissions and safety grounds. American dealers had to make do with the V8-powered 308 series. Nevertheless gray imports were in full bloom. The 400i was succeeded by the 412 which some peeps might recognize as the black-painted car from Daft Punk‚Äôs Electroma",,,,,,,,,,,,
BXP,Boston Properties,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vYmFua2VyYW5kdHJhZGVzbWFuLmNvbS9zdWJsZWFzZS1zdXJnZS1hZGRzLXByZXNzdXJlLW9uLWxhYi1waXBlbGluZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sublease Surge Adds Pressure on Lab Pipeline,"Gone are the days when sizeable blocks of space in life science hubs from Kendall Square to the suburbs were all but impossible to find unless a company committed to leasing space years in advance of completion.

Shocks to financial markets and caution by funding sources have changed the real estate equation in the Greater Boston life science cluster after nearly a decade of constant growth and absorption. Local firms have laid off more than 1100 employees in 2021 venture capital funding and IPO activity is down and sublease availabilities more than doubled in the second quarter to 916000 square feet.

‚ÄúIn 2021 it was an absolute feeding frenzy‚Äù said John Coakley life science principal for tenant advisory brokerage Cresa. ‚ÄúThere was no space available and there was a ton of demand. The tone out there in the market has changed and demand is down a little bit.‚Äù

Record flows of venture capital funding to life science companies in 2021 have declined and square-footage requirements have dropped by about 50 percent in the past year according to local commercial brokerage data.

In the near term Greater Boston‚Äôs leading position as the leading U.S. life science cluster appears secure. The availability rate across the region‚Äôs 33 million-square-foot lab market ‚Äì stretching from Boston to Worcester ‚Äì stood at just 2.4 percent in June according to JLL research including a 1.1 percent direct vacancy rate.

Local firms continue to receive healthy infusions of venture capital funding a frequent catalyst for growth-stage companies‚Äô search for additional real estate. VC funding to local firms totaled $5.6 billion in the first half of 2022 according to JLL down 30 percent from the record-setting levels of 2021 when area companies raised a total of $15 billion.

Mark Bruso senior research manager for JLL Boston said active requirements have declined from nearly 7 million square feet to 3.5 million square feet in the past year. And the scale of requirements has shifted to opposite ends of the space spectrum.

‚ÄúThose really early-stage companies are out there and there‚Äôs actually space for them to [lease] right now‚Äù Bruso said last week during a commercial real estate webinar sponsored by Banker & Tradesman. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre the most active segment of the market right now. But there‚Äôs been a bit of a hollowing out of the middle and all of that can be attributed to the difficulty of these mid-stage companies getting those second and third [venture capital] rounds.‚Äù

Full building leases by major pharmaceutical companies contributed to nearly 1.4 million square feet of positive absorption during the quarter with AstraZeneca and Takeda Pharmaceuticals committing to future Kendall Square developments by Boston Properties and BioMed Realty respectively and Sanofi occupying its new 530000-square-foot research campus at Cambridge Crossing. Total vacancies remained a modest 3.6 percent and another 1.7 million square feet of deals are in negotiation but not finalized according to JLL.

So it‚Äôs no surprise that commercial developers continue to play the lab card as their best bet for virtually every development site in the urban core and many suburban markets that have suitable zoning and site characteristics.

Space Swaps Don‚Äôt Guarantee Discounts

While lab space contains more specialized layouts and equipment for companies‚Äô specific needs a sizeable portion of the sublease space has yet to be occupied and can accommodate a change of tenant Coakley said. During 2021 many companies leased more space than needed for immediate expansion as a defensive measure reflecting the tight market.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not a new concept but it was happening a lot more last year‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA lot of groups said ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to take 40000 square feet and on day one I‚Äôm putting 10000 out for sublease.‚Äô I‚Äôll have the opportunity to grow into it over time. But there‚Äôs definitely some groups that have put more [sublease] space than they expected.‚Äù

In some cases asking rents for sublease space exceed direct rents because life science companies place a premium on speed to occupancy Coakley said.

The rise in sublease space does not directly affect landlords‚Äô income but adds new competition for landlords that are offering direct leased space and could moderate future rent increases. It also raises questions about the projected amount of new construction and lab conversions that the local market can support in coming years.

Big infusions of brand-new lab space are already coming in the city of Boston which appears on schedule to double its inventory of lab space by 2025. The current lab building boom will add 5.8 million square feet of inventory according to JLL data with the vast majority of activity taking place in the Seaport District and Fenway.

Uncertainty About Long-Term Pipeline

The picture is cloudier for life science projects scheduled for completion after 2024 many of which are still in permitting or preconstruction. Active requirements have declined more than 50 percent from last year‚Äôs peak according to Newmark data. And IPO activity has slowed amid the stock market‚Äôs retreat with only eight Bay State biopharma companies going public in the first half of 2022.

Vacancies in the 13 million-square-foot Cambridge lab market have increased from 1.2 percent to 2.2 percent in the past year according to Newmark research.

Liz Berthelette director of research for Newmark in Boston predicts that nearly two-thirds of the 40 million square feet of permitted and proposed life science projects in Greater Boston won‚Äôt get built as supply catches up with demand and macroeconomic factors make projects more difficult to pencil. Many projects still seeking financing are at risk of being delayed or put on hold.

‚ÄúInflationary pressures rising interest rates rising costs of capital and debt and construction costs are all putting pressure on developers‚Äù Berthelette said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt expect all of those projects to move forward in this development cycle.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,

Revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter will be about US$8.9bil (RM39.9bil) Broadcom said in a statement Thursday compared with an average analyst estimate of US$8.72bil (RM39.1bil). The shares rose about 2% in late trading following the report.

The outlook suggests Broadcom is sidestepping a broader decline in chip demand at least for now. Other suppliers including Nvidia Corp Intel Corp and Micron Technology Inc have predicted a steep sales slowdown ‚Äì hurt by sluggish orders of personal computers and smartphones.

Given that pessimism Broadcom chief executive officer Hock Tan acknowledged that his company‚Äôs report was ‚Äúsomewhat surreal.‚Äù

‚ÄúFrom our vantage point infrastructure spending is still very much holding‚Äù Tan said on a conference call with analysts. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true end demand.‚Äù

Broadcom‚Äôs backlog of orders which can‚Äôt be cancelled is expanding and now sits at US$31bil (RM139.1bil) Tan said.

The company is rigorous in ensuring that those orders reflect demand for real products ‚Äì and aren‚Äôt just going to be sitting in a warehouse. Broadcom‚Äôs average lead time the gap between getting an order and filling it remains at 50 weeks Tan said.

Broadcom is faring better than companies that focus on chips for personal computers which aren‚Äôt selling well because consumers are coping with inflation and putting off big-ticket purchases.

Nvidia revealed an additional headache this week when it said that new restrictions on exporting to China could hurt sales. The warning triggered a decline in chip stocks Thursday with Nvidia falling as much as 12%.

Broadcom which gets about 30% of its chip revenue from China hasn‚Äôt received a notice from the US government and doesn‚Äôt expect to according to Tan.

It sells a wide range of chips making it a bellwether for the tech industry.

Its semiconductors provide short-range connectivity for many Apple Inc devices including the iPhone. Other products are key to the networking machinery inside giant data centres owned by Amazon.com Inc‚Äôs AWS and Alphabet Inc‚Äôs Google.

Cisco Systems Inc uses those same chips in its products for corporate data centers and a different range of Broadcom silicon runs many of the world‚Äôs set-top boxes.

Broadcom said demand from its large North American customer its code for Apple was solid and that it expects an increase in the current period when that company debuts a new range of models.

The chip supplier said it expects unit volumes to be about the same as they were when the previous model was introduced.

Broadcom also has branched out into enterprise software by acquiring security and mainframe capabilities. And it‚Äôs trying to extend that diversification with a US$61bil (RM273.6bil) purchase of VMWare Inc in a transaction announced May 26. ‚Äî Bloomberg",,,,,,,,,,,,

It wasn‚Äôt much of a gamble.

Initially bets in the state were limited to $5 and casinos were not open 24/7. The idea behind the 1990 legalization was to boost tourism in old west communities. Instead analysts said Colorado‚Äôs casino customers spent a median amount that was far below the national average.

There was zero interest by Las Vegas or Reno casino operators to enter Colorado.

‚ÄúThe three gaming markets lacked quality assets‚Äù said JMP Securities gaming analyst Jordan Bender. ‚ÄúThese are not the easiest markets to get to especially during the winter with snow and ice on the ground. The casinos were not ‚Äòmust go to‚Äô destinations.‚Äù

Voters and Colorado casino supporters however didn‚Äôt give up.

Ballot questions in 2009 and 2020 increased and subsequently eliminated betting limits while adding gaming options normally found in Nevada casinos. Sports betting legalization in 2021 also helped make Colorado a market that gaming operators could no longer ignore.

Colorado's mountainous rural casino communities where an old west setting mixes with the 21st century and where only a few working gold mines still exist have turned the state into one of the top 15 gaming revenue-producing regions.

Macquarie Securities gaming analyst Chad Beynon said Colorado gaming has transitioned away from being an industry afterthought.

‚ÄúThe changes have been slow. We‚Äôll see if the growth continues‚Äù he said.

Expansion from tiny storefront casinos to mid-sized resorts has been taking place over the last few years. In Black Hawk three properties account for more than 1300 hotel rooms roughly 85 percent of the total market. In Cripple Creek a 300-room hotel-casino that is being built by Las Vegas-based Full House Resorts will double the market size when it opens next year.

Las Vegas and Reno gaming companies committed millions of dollars to change the perception of the Colorado casino communities but also use the market as a way to draw new business especially from the population-rich Denver area to Nevada.

‚ÄúThis was an opportunity for us because Black Hawk didn't have a high-end property‚Äù Monarch Casinos CEO John Farahi said of his Reno-based company‚Äôs 2012 acquisition of the former Riviera Black Hawk. ‚ÄúFor us this opened the market to attract more high-end clients.‚Äù

At the time of purchase the Riviera casino was 32000 square feet with 700 slot machines 12 table games and a buffet. The casino did not have any hotel rooms.

Ten years and $442 million later Monarch completed a total renovation of the renamed Monarch Casino Resort Spa Black Hawk that saw the casino double in size expand its number of slot machines and table games add a sportsbook and build a hotel tower that includes 516 rooms and suites a rooftop pool and spa and 5000 square feet of meeting space.

‚ÄúWe utilized every square inch of that property‚Äù Farahi said of the site that is the first casino encountered by visitors arriving from the Denver region along Highway 119.

Monarch which also operates the Atlantis in Reno does not break out total revenue and cash flow by property in its quarterly earnings. But Farahi said the Black Hawk casino is now the company‚Äôs flagship resort.

He said it would be a challenge for another casino operator to copy Monarch‚Äôs investment.

‚ÄúI don't know if there is as much land for somebody to come and do something significant‚Äù Farahi said. ‚ÄúWith the betting limits lifted we were able to expand the property and bring the high-end market to Black Hawk which is something you couldn‚Äôt do before.‚Äù

Truist Securities gaming analyst Barry Jonas said in a July research note that Monarch management indicated it was in the ‚Äúsecond or third inning‚Äù of its strategy to attract big-spending players to Black Hawk. He said Monarch had more than 23 percent of the business in Black Hawk which he expects will increase.

‚ÄúMarket share accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2020 when the first hotel rooms and expanded casino came online‚Äù Jonas said. ‚ÄúThe property is designed to attract higher-worth gamblers with a Vegas-esque experience.‚Äù

A Nevada influence in Black Hawk

In Black Hawk a mountain town 45 minutes west of Denver ownership changes reflect ties to multiple Nevada-based gaming companies.

In 2004 Las Vegas-based Ameristar Casinos bought the bankrupt Mountain High Casino and spent $80 million to renovate the property and change the name to Ameristar Black Hawk. The company spent $235 million to add a 536-room hotel tower in 2009 when gaming limits were first increased.

Ameristar is now owned by Penn Entertainment which operates M Resort in Henderson and two casinos in the northeastern Nevada community of Jackpot.

Prior to acquiring Caesars Entertainment in 2020 Reno-based Eldorado Resorts bought Isle of Capri Casinos in 2017 which included the 300-room Isle Casino Black Hawk. The property was rebranded last month as Horseshoe Casino Black Hawk.

Reno-based Jacobs Entertainment operates two Black Hawk casinos The Lodge and Gilpin Casino. Bally‚Äôs Corp. which is acquiring Tropicana Las Vegas took over three Black Hawk casinos formerly owned by Las Vegas-based Affinity Gaming in 2020. A year earlier Las Vegas-based Maverick Gaming bought a small Black Hawk casino and two Central City properties from a Colorado businessman.

The Grand Z Casino Hotel in Central City has been remodeled by a privately held company and Johnny Z‚Äôs Casino in Central City has been renamed and rebranded as the Dragon Tiger Casino an Asian-themed property.

Maverick CEO Eric Persson said the branding comes from Dragon Tiger Noodle Co. a business he co-owns with celebrity chef Jet Tila. He hopes to attract Asian business from Greater Denver to Central City.

‚ÄúHaving baccarat added to what we can offer customers opens everyone up to the Asian communities in Colorado‚Äù Persson said. ‚ÄúGetting rid of the betting limits and adding the games has expanded the market. You also have to credit Monarch because there weren‚Äôt a lot of rooms here. Anytime another place adds capacity it helps everybody.‚Äù

Beynon said casino operators used to view their properties as a way to pad customer portfolios with potential players from Denver.

But with the 10-county Denver region having a population of almost 3 million according to the most recent Census the market is too big to ignore. Beynon expects the Black Hawk casinos will market to residents of the wealthier Denver suburbs which weren‚Äôt a viable customer base until the operating structure changed.

‚ÄúThe goal is obviously to get those western Denver residents to change their perception of Black Hawk‚Äù Beynon said. ‚ÄúWith the changes I feel like they could market to those customers in a different way. I think that‚Äôs important for Monarch in the way they run their business.‚Äù

Las Vegas and Reno casino operators also view Denver as a Nevada feeder market.

At Harry Reid International Airport the Denver International Airport fills the second-biggest number of seats both coming and going. Only Los Angeles International Airport has more. An airport spokesman expects that status will hold through the end of 2022.

At Reno-Tahoe International Airport Denver is the fourth leading destination for Northern Nevada behind Las Vegas Phoenix and Los Angeles.

Stifel Financial gaming analyst Jeffrey Stantial said Black Hawk ‚Äúis a great market from a fundamentals perspective.‚Äù He noted that Denver was ranked as a top economy nationally for multiple years prior to the pandemic.

‚ÄúCertainly the large-scale Monarch project is disruptive given Ameristar was previously the only high-end product in town‚Äù Stantial said. ‚ÄúMonarch‚Äôs growth thesis is more predicated on growing the VIP pool and overall market versus market share gains.‚Äù

No limits more games

Colorado gaming prospects improved in 2009 when voters elected to increase betting limits to $100 per wager. The casinos were also allowed to add craps and roulette to their lineup.

The game changer came 11 years later when Colorado voters overwhelmingly approved Amendment 77 which removed wagering limits and allowed casinos to begin offering several previously forbidden games such as baccarat keno and the big six wheel.

The market immediately shifted.

Colorado's gaming revenue topped $1.23 billion in 2021 the state‚Äôs highest single-year total and the 14th highest of all commercial gaming states according to the American Gaming Association.

Black Hawk and Central City casinos combined for $812 million of the total which made the area the 15th largest commercial gaming market in the U.S. last year finishing $100 million ahead of downtown Las Vegas.

Through June Colorado gaming revenue was $646 million up 15.1 percent for the first six months of 2022.

Sports betting added

In November 2019 Colorado voters narrowly approved Proposition DD which legalized both online sports betting and retail sportsbooks with the tax revenue being directed toward statewide water-related projects and obligations.

Since launching in May 2020 more than $7.6 billion has been wagered on sports through June with operators collecting revenue of $464.9 million. Colorado is practically an online monopoly with more than 98 percent of all wagers placed through mobile apps.

The regulations allow Colorado casinos to have sports betting deals with multiple companies. In June there were 44 online and retail sportsbooks.

‚ÄúWith its very low taxes and license fees and its liberal market access climate Colorado is arguably the most favorable online sports betting operating environment in the U.S.‚Äù said Eilers & Krejcik Gaming analyst Chris Krafcik who follows sports betting nationally.

He said Colorado has become ‚Äúan ideal proving ground‚Äù for small sports betting brands with ‚Äúdisruptor-style ambitions‚Äù and a launchpad for newer companies. Krafcik also expects the state to see a turnover in sports betting operators.

‚ÄúWe think there is going to be a steady inflow of new supply in the coming years‚Äù he said.

Colorado‚Äôs structure has allowed smaller Nevada-based sports betting companies to chart a path outside the Silver State.

Maverick Gaming and Monarch Gaming operate their own sports wagering platforms in Colorado. Circa Sports which is owned by downtown Las Vegas casino owner Derek Stevens has an online sports betting agreement with Century Casinos for its Cripple Creek property.

SuperBook which is operated by the Westgate Las Vegas has both retail and online sports betting agreements with Jacobs Entertainment at The Lodge in Black Hawk.

All the major sports betting operators are in Colorado. Caesars Sportsbook is building a retail space inside the Horseshoe Black Hawk. Penn National Gaming brought one of its first Barstool Sports retail sportsbooks to Ameristar Black Hawk.

But the process created some unusual market access agreements.

Strip gaming giant MGM Resorts International which has casinos in eight states but not in Colorado has an online partnership with the Midnight Rose Casino in Cripple Creek one of three small storefront gambling halls operated by Colorado-based Triple Crown Casinos.

Bally‚Äôs Corp. attached its BallyBet online sportsbook to one of its Black Hawk casinos but signed online partnership agreements with DraftKings and FanDuel that are tied with its two other properties. A DraftKings sportsbook is inside Bally‚Äôs Black Hawk North.

Similar to most other states DraftKings BetMGM and FanDuel dominate the market with a combined 84 percent of the wagers and revenue.

Krafcik said Colorado‚Äôs sports betting environment is favorable to the large and small operators including international-based sports betting businesses looking to gain a foothold in the U.S.

‚ÄúIf you want to go head-to-head with one of the big three that's of course going to be very very challenging‚Äù Krafcik said. ‚ÄúIf you're looking to proof-of-concept your product or showcase your capabilities in a U.S.-regulated environment then Colorado is an economical market in which to do so.‚Äù

Construction for the $250 million Chamonix Casino Resort in Cripple Creek Colorado is expected to be completed in early 2023 according to developer Full House Resorts. The property is seen on Aug. 16 2022. (Howard Stutz/The Nevada Independent)

Cripple Creek seeks a larger piece of the action

Cripple Creek which is located an hour west of Colorado Springs should see a boost in gaming revenue and visitation through the development of a $250 million casino-hotel by Full House and the transformation of an older casino into a Golden Nugget by billionaire Tilman Fertitta.

JMP‚Äôs Bender said Cripple Creek has not expanded like Black Hawk because it doesn‚Äôt draw business from Denver which has almost four times the population of Colorado Springs.

‚ÄúThis goes back to the market being underserved with a quality asset‚Äù Bender said.

Full House which has five casinos in four states acquired Bronco Billy‚Äôs Casino in Cripple Creek for $30 million in 2016 and immediately expanded by acquiring the adjacent storefronts along East Bennett Avenue.

The investment set up competition across the street with Century Casinos which combined several storefronts into one casino and Colorado-based Triple Crown Casinos which has three storefront properties ‚Äì The Brass Ass Midnight Rose and McGill‚Äôs.

Full House owns 17 of the 20 storefronts on its side of Bennett Avenue and would have owned the other three except Triple Crown wouldn‚Äôt sell the locations.

‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt want us to have a monopoly on the street‚Äù said Bronco Billy‚Äôs General Manager Baxter Lee who came to Cripple Creek from Full House‚Äôs Silver Slipper Casino in Bay St. Louis Mississippi when company CEO Dan Lee (no relation) asked him to make the move.

The main reason for the switch was to help watch over the development of Chamonix Casino Hotel which features a theme resembling Chamonix-Mont Blanc the French alpine resort and site of the first Winter Olympics in 1924.

The property‚Äôs planned 300 hotel rooms would more than double Cripple Creek‚Äôs current hotel capacity. Chamonix will have an expanded gaming area restaurants meeting and convention space that can accommodate concerts and other entertainment a rooftop pool a spa and a 300-space parking garage.

Baxter Lee pointed toward an empty space at the front entrance where a jewelry store specializing in gold that pays homage to Cripple Creek‚Äôs mining legacy will be built. Chamonix is expected to open next year. He noted that many of Bronco Billy‚Äôs storefront units are not currently casinos and are being used by companies involved in Chamonix‚Äôs construction. One unit has model hotel rooms for Chamonix.

During Full House‚Äôs second-quarter earnings call Dan Lee said Cripple Creek‚Äôs status as a historic district prohibited the company from building a large high-rise hotel.

‚ÄúBut we get to a significant size by sprawling out‚Äù he said explaining that the project took over former parking lots and other vacant land parcels.

‚ÄúFull House is trying to put together a very nice asset which the market lacks in a much smaller encashment area‚Äù Bender said. ‚ÄúFrom a market perceptive this will drive more people into Cripple Creek benefitting other operators like Century.‚Äù

Stantial said it will be incumbent on Full House to increase consumer awareness of Cripple Creek‚Äôs transformation into a regional-destination market.

Cripple Creek could soon have another player in the market in Fertitta whose Houston-based company owns Golden Nugget casinos in Las Vegas; Laughlin; Biloxi Mississippi; Lake Charles Louisiana; and Atlantic City.

In April a $43 million deal for the Wildwood Casino and Hotel was announced. Fertitta said the property which is currently the largest casino in Cripple Creek with 528 slot machines and 12 table games and the largest hotel with 100 rooms would be renamed and branded as a Golden Nugget.

‚ÄúGolden Nugget entering is a small positive‚Äù Bender said. ‚ÄúThe property itself is pretty small but to have a brand like that come in could draw interest.‚Äù

Stantial said Fertitta would not have made the investment if he wasn‚Äôt convinced Cripple Creek could support two higher-end properties.

‚ÄúI see it as a nice vote of confidence. Golden Nugget is a seasoned operator and clearly sees merits to the growth thesis for Cripple Creek‚Äù he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2xhcy12ZWdhcy1jYXNpbm8tY2xvc2luZy1hbm90aGVyLXdpbGwtdGFrZS1pdHMtcGxhY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Las Vegas Casino Closing Another Will Take Its Place,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2xhcy12ZWdhcy1jYXNpbm8tY2xvc2luZy1hbm90aGVyLXdpbGwtdGFrZS1pdHMtcGxhY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016712896710>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2xhcy12ZWdhcy1jYXNpbm8tY2xvc2luZy1hbm90aGVyLXdpbGwtdGFrZS1pdHMtcGxhY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc2hlZC5jb20vOTkzMzg1L3RoZS1oZWxscy1raXRjaGVuLW1lYWwtdGhhdC1oYXMtcmVkZGl0LXJhdmluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Hell's Kitchen Meal That Has Reddit Raving,"The classic dish that everyone seems to like is of course Gordon Ramsay's beef wellington consisting of tender beef that's wrapped in puff pastry with mushroom duxelles sandwiched in between (per MasterClass).

An appetizing photo of the Wellington was posted on Reddit by user Hooch_Pandersnatch and Redditors soon started raving about it.

One Redditor said ""This is making me very excited about my reservation there next month"" while another acknowledged that ""the Wellington is superb but the mashed potatoes are godlike."" It seems like many people like the mash better as user IveeLaChatte also praised it by saying ""Those potatoes are making my mouth water."" Luckily you'll get both the meat and the mash on the same plate.

Mantoloking Road Alehouse also is celebrating its grand ""reopening"". So it's a great time to head over and check out the newly renovated outdoor dining. There is also a big event coming up on Saturday September 10th.

Actor and now ""brewing"" businessman Kelsey Grammer will be appearing at the Mantoloking Road Alehouse next Saturday September 10th. Kelsey began Faith American Brewing Company in 2015 and is in Ocean County to share his experience and taste of his three beers. Faith American Ale IPA and Blue.

Kelsey Grammer will appear at Mantoloking Road Alehouse from Noon to 1:30 pm on Saturday September 10th. Should be a fun day and a great experience.

Swing by the Mantoloking Alehouse and celebrate their grand ""re-opening"" and enjoy either their lunch or dinner specials. Of course they are excited now that their outdoor dining renovations are done and you can swing by for a fantastic experience outdoors at a great time of year to enjoy fresh air cooler temps and sunshine.

They are celebrating the 125th birthday of condensed soup.

Condensed soup was a big breakthrough in helping homemakers serve up a great meal. One can of condensed soup with water or milk added depending on the soup would yield 2 or 3 servings of soup as opposed to a single serving can of soup.

Condensed soup is a cost-efficient space-saving meal alternative and its long success rate of 125 years on your grocery shelves still remains a staple on dinner tables across the world.

The Campbell's Soup Co. was started by Joseph Campbell who was a fruit merchant from Bridgeton New Jersey and Abraham Anderson who was an icebox maker from South Jersey. They opened their first plant in Camden New Jersey in 1869.

Anderson would leave the company and John Dorrance an MIT graduate working at Campbell‚Äôs for $7.50 a week as a chemist developed a condensed soup tomato which changed the food industry. It was his invention in 1897 of condensed soup that led to Campbell‚Äôs Soup becoming so successful. Dorrance would later become president of the company after a buyout of the Campbell family.

Condensed soups are still used in many recipes and continue to be a strong product for revenue for Campbell‚Äôs. In 2021 Campbell‚Äôs had close to $8.5 billion in revenue.

Cream of mushroom the classic tomato soup and cream of chicken are big sellers for Campbell‚Äôs. I have used condensed soups in a recipe or two and the results are always good.

The next time you reach for a condensed can of soup thank our New Jersey company Campbell‚Äôs for making a tasty addition to your table.

In 1962 Andy Warhol would forever enshrine an avatar of everyday Americana as a lasting icon of modern culture. His serial work Campbell's Soup Cans made its debut a series of 32 canvases each devoted to a different variety of the ubiquitous canned soup. Those screen-printed paintings put the emerging Pop Art movement on the map displaying the artist‚Äôs nonchalance about what subjects were fit for artistic glory. (The now-priceless canvases first exhibited by Los Angeles gallerist Irving Blum are now part of MoMA‚Äôs permanent collection but Eli Broad paid $11 million in 2006 for a later single soup can painting.)

But that all came later. As the seemingly guileless Warhol explained his choice at the time Campbell‚Äôs soup was simply what he ate for lunch every single day.

However the same year that Warhol unveiled his seminal Pop Art pieces ‚Äî his paean to the ordinary the corporate ideal of American mass-production ‚Äî came the beginnings of a counter-revolution in how the country would regard food on their tables. This time the medium was not the gallery wall; it was televised.

MODERN CHOICE From Andy Warhol‚Äôs Campbell's Soup I Portfolio  1968 ( Artsy.net )

In 1962 one of the authors of the just-published Mastering the Art of French Cooking turned up on Boston public television show I‚Äôve Been Reading and astonished the grumpy book-reviewing host by turning out a perfectly made omelet with a hot plate giant whisk and a few eggs she brought along. Afterwards dozens of viewers wrote to WGBH wanting more. After three pilots Julia Child made her series debut in The French Chef in 1963.

Child on potatoes in 1963 üëá

Child would have turned 110 this month (hat tip to Lane Doss‚Äô Broken Palette newsletter for the reminder and this summary):

‚ÄúIn an era that embraced the modernity of frozen TV dinners and instant Jell-O Child reminded people that the act of cooking for someone is also an act of love. She also taught American housewives ‚Äî and later everyone else that cooking need not be a chore ‚Äî it can be a creative outlet and a source of great pride.‚Äù

Child‚Äôs initial series ran 10 years winning the first Emmy for an educational program and a Peabody. With almost 20 books and countless series she didn‚Äôt put down her whisk until age 85 after her last program in 1998 Julia Child & Jacques P√©pin: Cooking at Home. A towering cultural figure literally (at six-foot-two) she was lampooned by Dan Aykroyd in an unforgettable 1978 Saturday Night Live skit. Julia was so tickled that she used to play a videotape of the segment for her dinner guests shouting ‚ÄúSave the liver!‚Äù

JUST THE APPETIZER

Today we have a food-stuffed television landscape including a whole cable channel devoted to cooking star TV chefs and even just food-adjacent stars.

Meryl Streep earned one of her multitude of Oscar nominations for her portrayal of Child in the 2009 Julie and Julia. Today Child who died in 2004 is the subject of an HBO Max narrative series Julia starring British actor Sarah Lancashire now readying its second season.

Considered unscripted TV‚Äôs fastest-growing sub-genre a sample of today‚Äôs food TV includes also on HBO Max Selena Gomez‚Äôs popular Selena + Chef (with a parade of bold-face-name chef guests like Marcus Samuelsson Roy Choi Jos√© Andr√©s and Rachel Ray); Bravo‚Äôs Top Chef (now filming its 13th season in London) and its imitators; and Netflix‚Äôs The Great British Baking Show which just announced an American iteration produced by Roku with Ellie Kemper and Zach Cherry. Scripted food drama is also proving delectable: this summer‚Äôs unsettling The Bear gave Hulu an edgy talker and the upcoming black comedy horror film The Menu starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Nicholas Hoult fending off a scary chef played by Ralph Fiennes is premiering at the Toronto Film Festival.

It‚Äôs a smorgasbord fragmented from Child‚Äôs singular vision into a hundred directions. But food and its subsequent TV programming is more than ever proxy for our larger cultural conversations.

And in the context of the entertainment industry‚Äôs sweeping changes ‚Äî where Warner Bros. and Discovery two companies with distinct identities are in the throes of an arranged marriage ‚Äî it seemed a moment to examine the culture of what today‚Äôs food TV reflects about the times.

THREE DEFINING WOMEN

In the '60s America had an extended love affair with all things Gallic. There was a Francophile First Lady in Jacqueline Kennedy. In New York the apogee of fine dining in the U.S. was a group of mannered French restaurants that included Lut√®ce La C√¥te Basque and La Caravelle a Kennedy favorite. (California was but a culinary backwater.) In the first season of The French Chef Julia exhorted her viewers to make duck √† l‚Äôorange chicken livers √† la Francaise (with Madeira sauce) and crepes suzette for their dinner parties.

Child ushered in a new appreciation of cooking but it was a style devoted to a singular vision of haute cuisine a reflection of her Cordon Bleu training. She cemented the notion by signing off each episode with the just-prepared dish a glass of wine and a hearty bon appetit!

MARTHA INC.

As the ‚Äò70s entered the Me Decade ‚Äò80s a new star-chef hit the airwaves and came to symbolize women‚Äôs emerging role in business (the era of Working Girl).

Stoked by frequent newspaper publicity and appearances on shows of the time ‚Äî The Oprah Winfrey Show and Larry King Live ‚Äî she published a book every year for the rest of the decade (often efficiently ghost-written something Julia would have blanched at). Her careful precision and aesthetic cemented a largely white Northeastern WASP Americana ideal companion meals to the constructed Ralph Lauren aesthetic of the time.

Eventually Martha became more: a brand.

A FOOD NETWORK STAR

Which brings us to Ree ‚ÄúThe Pioneer Woman‚Äù Drummond.

If you‚Äôre not familiar let‚Äôs get you up to speed. With nods to Giada De Laurentiis Ina Garten and Rachel Ray it‚Äôs Drummond who has been climbing the ranks at now Discovery-owned Food Network for the last 10 years who seems to have met the moment all from her countrified ranch kitchen just outside Pawhuska Oklahoma. With her husband Ladd whom she euphemistically refers to as ‚ÄúMarlboro Man‚Äù they are somewhat at odds with Ree‚Äôs ‚Äúhomey‚Äù vibe since their share of the family ranch empire totals a massive 433000 acres making them the 23rd largest landowners in the country. (Cue Yellowstone!)

They homeschool their four kids and she is unabashedly ‚Äútraditional‚Äù in matters of romance. She claims he wouldn‚Äôt marry her until she was able to make his favorite breakfast Eggs in a Hole ‚Äî and her version is a dish made with at least a half-stick of butter. (Contrast that with Stewart divorced and largely single the entire time she built her empire.)

In 2017 Food Network and Drummond were criticized after a particularly distasteful segment resurfaced from five years earlier.

As reported by Huffington Post:

The questionable segment‚Ä¶shows Drummond playing a ‚Äútrick‚Äù on her family by serving them a batch of ‚ÄúAsian hot wings‚Äù instead of the Buffalo-style they‚Äôre expecting. Drummond‚Äôs crew is askance asking ‚ÄúWhere are the real wings?‚Äù Another man says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt trust ‚Äôem.‚Äù Then Drummond chuckles indulgently and tells them ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just kidding guys. I wouldn‚Äôt do that to you.‚Äù Then she pulls a tray of traditional Buffalo wings out of the oven inspiring one of these gourmets to say ‚ÄúNow those are some wings.‚Äù

A couple of weeks ago Drummond made a big step up to prime-time host with Big Bad Budget Battle produced by the Food Network‚Äôs biggest draw portly good ‚Äòole boy Guy Fieri with his white shock of hair.

Besides starring on The Pioneer Woman since 2011 Drummond also turns out cookbooks children‚Äôs series and home goods cookware and women‚Äôs wear all exclusive at Walmart. Drummond fans can even get a taste of the lifestyle with a stay in Pawhuska at the Drummond-owned lodging and retail-restaurant complex. Last year she even logged her first role in her own Yule movie Candy Coated Christmas for Discovery+ playing a small-town bakery owner.

Drummond presents herself as a bit of a rube and she‚Äôs okay with that. Her backcountry voice timbre and jokey manner is probably as beloved by her fans as they seem ridiculous to ‚Äúcity folk.‚Äù Though the Oklahoma native actually went to college at USC it doesn‚Äôt seem to have rubbed off.

It‚Äôs tempting to speculate on The Pioneer Woman and the network‚Äôs lineup of mostly male white prime-time hosts (the various shows are populated with a diverse slate of contestants and the network also features ‚Äúdaytime‚Äù cooking shows featuring more diverse chefs like Delicious Miss Brown and Molly Yeh of Girl Meets Farm). But Food Network seems untouched by the same battles that have roiled gourmands with issues of equity and representation that led to the resignations of Bon Appetit editor Adam Rappaport New York Times columnist Alison Roman the editor of the Los Angeles Times food section and others.

One could call those travails coastal fights internecine media battles that most Americans don‚Äôt care about. But as Discovery+ the streaming home of Drummond and all of Food Network prepares to combine into one entity with HBO Max as part of CEO David Zaslav‚Äôs new kingdom some are predicting culture clash.

There‚Äôs been a welter of speculation about a regressive turn coming on Zaslav‚Äôs watch following his hiring of a nearly all white male leadership team and appointment of six white men to the board.

The Daily Beast reported that laid-off Warners executives are foreseeing ‚Äúa rejection of left-wing or highly diverse content in favor of more homogenous Middle America-friendly fare.‚Äù Interesting detail from the piece:

THE NEXT RECIPE

So will Max‚Äôs Selena + Chef CNN‚Äôs reruns of humanist Anthony Bourdain or even its bio-pic series Julia (wherein the first season she came face to face with her drag-queen doppelg√§nger) comfortably coexist on the same platform as The Pioneer Woman? One has to wonder even in the era of algorithms that allow the viewer to choose their own adventure.

Our narrative of any era‚Äôs defining female chef has mirrored our cultural shifts: from globalist Child ambitious post-women‚Äôs rights empire builder Stewart to Drummond whose popularity stems in part out of a seeming rejection of our media‚Äôs progressive values.

Putting all those ingredients together in 2022‚Äôs ultra-bifurcated era to this scribe it sounds like one potentially messy kitchen.

But rather than simply enjoy the party identitarians on both the left and the right have sought to fold it into Britain‚Äôs interminable culture wars.

An identitarian stand-off has ensued following several scenes of violence at this year‚Äôs event over the bank-holiday weekend. One such outbreak culminated in 21-year-old Takayo Nembhard being stabbed to death while six others were wounded in other incidents. That such violence has been allowed to happen once again at such a long-standing public event raises serious questions. Indeed this is not the first time the celebrations have been marred by violence. Carnival has long been developing an unfortunate reputation for poor safety. This should not be an insurmountable problem. But sadly it has become increasingly difficult to speak openly about it. Any criticism of Carnival and its organisation will be quickly dismissed as ‚Äòracist‚Äô. For instance in the words of an article in Vice magazine Notting Hill Carnival ‚Äòis disproportionately policed and scrutinised for bad behaviour both on the ground and in the reportage afterwards‚Äô. Why? ‚ÄòBecause Britain is racist‚Äô apparently.

Is this really fair? It is true that race plays a significant role in the history of Carnival. What would become Notting Hill Carnival first emerged in the mid-1960s as an attempt to repair the fractious race relations in London at the time (in 1958 there had been race riots in Notting Hill). So there is no denying that Carnival itself and the reaction to it have sometimes been framed in racial terms. But to see the public revulsion over knife violence purely as a sign of racism is absurd. What happened over the bank-holiday weekend was violent criminal behaviour. Yet woke identitarians seem to think we should simply look the other way if the alleged perpetrators or indeed victims are black. So much for black lives mattering.

But it is not just those on the left who have used this year‚Äôs Carnival to push their identitarian narrative. Some on the right have also cynically used the violence at this year‚Äôs event to rail against multiculturalism and immigration. Indeed one commentator even called the violence and stabbings ‚Äòthe cost of diversity‚Äô. The great thing about Notting Hill Carnival is that it is genuinely diverse in that it really does bring together people from all classes backgrounds and races. It is a living breathing experiment in cultural mixing. In this sense it is the exact opposite of the top-down version of ‚Äòdiversity‚Äô pushed by our woke establishment which seeks to divide people along racial lines. So it is troubling that some see an event like Carnival as a potential threat to society or as an inherent source of conflict.

Amid the culture-war fury the Met are now calling for the future of Notting Hill Carnival to be ‚Äòreviewed‚Äô. There are suggestions it could be moved to Hyde Park or even cancelled altogether. That would be a real tragedy. There is no doubt that the safety and security of Notting Hill Carnival needs improving. People have lost their lives. And that is why we need to speak out about the problem ‚Äì so it can be fixed and Carnival can carry on. If not the state could step in to put an end to everyone‚Äôs fun.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVtb3VudGFpbmVlci5jb20vc3BvcnRzL3R1c2NvbGEtY3Jvc3MtY291bnRyeS1vcGVucy1zZWFzb24tYXQtd25jLWNhcm5pdmFsL2FydGljbGVfY2E1OTE0MmMtMjg3YS0xMWVkLWE1MGUtYmI0YWVmOTkzN2UwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tuscola cross-country opens season at WNC Carnival,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

The global corporate insurance carrier analyzed over 240000 marine insurance industry claims over the past five years costing over $9 billion reporting that the danger of fires is increasing and already the most expensive cause of loss accounting for 18 percent of the value of all claims.

In a new safety bulletin Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty reports that the number of fires on board large vessels has increased significantly in recent years. Across all vessel types and causes fire/explosion was the second top cause of the 54 total losses reported in 2021 accounting for eight of the losses. Fires were second with only vessels that foundered 12 vessels were lost in 2021. Further over the past decade fire ranks as the third top cause of loss overall accounting for 120 out of a reported 892 total losses. Again only foundered (465) or wrecked/stranded vessels (164) accounted for more claims.

In 2021 fire was the third top cause of shipping incidents overall around the globe ‚Äì behind machinery damage (1311) and collision (222). There have been 41 total losses involving ro-ros over the past decade with fires causing six losses. Among the specific incidents they highlight the February 2022 fire and subsequent sinking of the ro-ro Felicity Ace the June 2020 fire on the car carrier H√∂egh Xiamen and the January 2020 fire on the containership Cosco Pacific. The common denominator in all the fires as well as specific instances of container fires was the presence of lithium-ion batteries.

‚ÄúAGCS has long warned about the potential dangers that lithium-ion batteries can pose for the shipping and wider logistics industries whether they are being transported inside electric vehicles or as standalone cargo if they are not handled stored or transported correctly with fire being a significant hazard‚Äù said Captain Rahul Khanna Global Head of Marine Risk Consulting AGCS. ‚ÄúBatteries are not only a potential cause of fire if damaged overcharged or subjected to high temperatures they can also aggravate other causes of fire at sea and are difficult to extinguish as they have the potential to reignite days or even weeks later.‚Äù

Allianz highlights four main hazards involving the transportation of these batteries including fire explosion toxic gases and the potential for thermal runaway (a rapid self-heating fire that can cause an explosion) and is considered a likely element in the loss of the Felicity Ace this year. In most shipboard incidents Allianz warns that a thermal runaway event can be a significant possibility unless immediate action is taken by the crew such as suppressing a fire with copious amounts of water over a long period of time. However this can be extremely challenging due to factors such as early detection being difficult a shortage of crew members and a lack of adequate firefighting capabilities on board.

The bulletin identifies the most common causes of the fire hazard as being substandard manufacturing of battery cells/devices; over-charging of the battery cells; over-temperature by short-circuiting and damaged battery cells or devices which among other causes can result from poor packing and handling or cargo shift in rough seas if not adequately secured.

Ro-ro and car carrier vessels they point out can be more exposed to fire and stability issues than other vessels. To facilitate the transport of automobiles and other vehicles the internal spaces are not divided into separate sections like other cargo ships. The lack of internal bulkheads can have an adverse impact on fire safety and a small fire on one vehicle or battery can grow out of control very quickly. Vehicles are not easily accessible once loading has been completed. The large volume of air inside the open cargo decks provides a ready supply of oxygen in case of fire.

‚ÄúSafe carriage has become an emerging risk concern for the shipping community raising questions about the adequacy of fire detection and firefighting capabilities on board vessels cargo loading procedures and even whether changes in vessel design may be necessary given specialist equipment is required to extinguish any blazes‚Äù says Khanna.

Allianz recommends that the primary focus must be on loss prevention focusing on storage and in transit. They are calling for training to ensure staff is trained to follow correct packing and handling procedures and that seafarers have had Li-ion battery firefighting training. It is critical they said to check all EVs are properly secured to prevent any shifting during transportation. They also recommend checking whether the EVs have an undamaged battery system and ensuring there is no charging during the voyage In transit anything that can aid early detection is critical including watchkeeping/fire rounds and utilizing thermal scanners gas detectors heat/smoke detectors and CCTV cameras.

‚ÄúIf the maritime industry is to improve its incident record related to the transportation of lithium-ion batteries all parties involved in the supply chain must understand the hazards involved the most common causes and the problems associated with transporting in commerce‚Äù says Captain Randall Lund Senior Marine Risk Consultant at AGCS and one of the authors of the report. ‚ÄúRegulations and guidance are specific in addressing these batteries to help prevent most incidents but these can only be effective if they are communicated and enforced.""

But those webs aren't from spiders. Fall webworms are moth caterpillars that are native to North America.

Webworms can typically be seen later in the summer munching on a whole variety of deciduous trees such as maple elm and poplar. For the most part they aren't picky bugs.

Unlike other caterpillars webworms like to live in large communities.

After hatching the larvae they will stay together in a community to build a large web nest to use as shelter.

""It protects them from things like birds and ants and other predators that might affect them"" said entomologist Ilan Domnich.

LISTEN |

Because the nest is so tightly wound the temperature inside them is high which increases the metabolism of the worms and speeds up their development.

The webworm will go through six different stages as a caterpillar staying close to the tent and only venturing out to eat.

""That's when people will notice defoliation in the trees when those big caterpillars are eating lots of leaves"" Domnich said.

Do webworms cause damage to the trees?

Webworms don't always damage the trees.

If you get a normal webworm population they may eat all the leaves off of a tree Domnich said.

""The tree won't be very happy but it'll be just fine. Next year it will grow all new leaves"" he said.

However if the webworm population comes back year after year trees could get stressed out and eventually die.

""But that will typically only happen when you get these huge outbreak populations"" Domnich said.

The worms go through cycles where there's just a few of them around and next year they're everywhere.

How can you treat webworms?

One way to treat webworms is by using pesticide one that specifically targets caterpillars so as to reduce harm to other types of insects.

""All the other bugs everything that's eating the bugs the birds and everything like that it's all part of the same ecosystem"" Domnich said.

Following the rules and guidelines for pesticide spraying is very important Domnich said.

""You never spray when it's going to rain because it's just going to wash out"" he said.

Similarly you never spray during the middle of the day when pollinators are active.

Another way to control the caterpillars Domnich said is to simply pick them up and throw them away.

Yearly webworm outbreaks can cause stress to the tree and eventually kill it but that's not always the case. (Ishita Verma/CBC)

""The best way to get rid of them is just to use ... a garden fork or those forks you use for roasting hot dogs and just reach up into the web and twirl it like you're picking up spaghetti and just pull the web out of the the tree"" Mike Jenkins pest management coordinator for the City of Edmonton told CBC's Radio Active.

Webworms don't have itchy hairs and they also don't bite making them safe to grab.

""Or remove the cocoons if you see those"" Domnich said.

The cocoons are spun out of silk and look like a big fuzzy pill about an inch long.

Once in the cocoon the caterpillars fall to the ground pupate over the winter and hatch out as moths in the spring.

While the image of worms in a web nest can be gross and slightly off-putting webworms are a great food source for birds and are an important part of the ecosystem Domnich said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzb2JzZXJ2ZXIuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9vdXRkb29yLzIwMjIvMDkvZW1lcmFsZC1hc2gtYm9yZXItZGFtYWdlLW1vcmUtdGhhbi1qdXN0LWFzaC10cmVlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Emerald Ash Borer damage more than just ash trees,"Where are your blind spots? In a car these are the spots that you cannot see when turning or backing up. Fancy cameras and screens are being used to help drivers see their blind spots. But no camera can cure a mental blind spot and the effects of that are everywhere. We often don‚Äôt see the things that we haven‚Äôt trained our brains to see.

There is a famous video of a group of people watching dancers onstage. A man walks through them in a bear costume but no one notices because they are so focused on the dancers. The human mind is capable of such focus that it is possible to not see something really obvious.

One of those disconcerting moments happened to me one past summer as I talked to Cornell entomologist Jason Dombroskie who was collecting moths at Audubon as part of a research project to identify the moths of New York.

My knowledge of moths is limited to identifying only a couple dozen species of the hundreds that are out there. Some are easy to identify most are put into my mental ‚Äúsmall gray moth‚Äù category and ignored.

I was rather proud of myself when I could identify some of the moths that he had found since the odds of him finding one of the few I know were slim. One of these was the Waved Sphinx moth. These gray moths are masters of camouflage but have distinctive wavy black lines and a white eye-shaped dot on the wing that make it one that I recognize.

‚ÄúThis moth is in danger of going extinct‚Äù Dombroskie said. This news came as a complete shock to me but it shouldn‚Äôt have. The answer to why was lurking in my blind spot hiding in plain sight amongst all the facts that I knew but hadn‚Äôt put together yet.

Waved Sphinx moth caterpillars mostly eat Ash trees though there is evidence that they will eat oak and privet as well. Ash trees are slowly but surely disappearing from the region with the spread of a tiny green insect called the Emerald Ash Borer (EAB). This insect bores into the ash tree and kills it within a year or so. As the main food source for the caterpillar dwindles the moth may disappear as well.

According to the journal ‚ÄúBiological Invasions‚Äù there are forty-three species that depend on ash trees and may disappear. Some are moths like the Waved Sphinx and others are lesser known insects that feed on the leaves seeds and bark of ash trees. These species only feed on ash and not other plants similar to how Monarch caterpillars only eat milkweed.

The study noted 282 species that use ash trees. Of these 208 are at a low risk for going extinct. Thirteen are at a medium risk and 17 are at a high-moderate risk of extinction that join into the 44 at high risk.

For me that was a pretty big blind spot. At Audubon we treated the ash trees in the Ted Grisez Arboretum to keep the Emerald Ash Borers from killing them. My thoughts never went beyond the tragic loss of a tree species to wonder at the loss of other species that could disappear with them.

If the disappearance of ash trees from the landscape could wipe out other species did that happen in the past? A quick search revealed that the chestnut blight of the twentieth century took out at least five species of moth and a weevil as well as billions of American Chestnut trees. While scientists are working on helping the trees make a comeback the insects that disappeared with the majority of the chestnuts are gone for good.

When an insect goes extinct when the plant it depends on disappears it is called co-extinction. While the American Chestnut did not go extinct it became scarce enough that many of the insects that depended on it disappeared.

This was my blind spot. As I figure out how to get dead ash trees safely down or buy ash firewood that is popping up in people‚Äôs yards I never thought to look at the ripple effect of a tree‚Äôs disappearance. It affects insects and through them other animals whose lives revolve around a tree threatened by an Asian insect brought here by accident.

It‚Äôs a pretty big blind spot and one that I was glad to have pointed out. One of the hardest things to do is think of all the consequences of human actions. It never occurred to me that I would have to mourn the loss of moths that disappeared with the ash or that there were species I would never see because of the disappearance of the American Chestnut. It puts everything in a different light and even if there is little I can do to stop it I can still stop and pay attention to the loss of a species.

They are looking for ash trees that are resistant to EAB. They are popping up here and there. With luck in ten years I will not be writing a eulogy for the insects that died with their only food source.

A researcher lives with the subject matter during their research period. It is an organic relationship between the research subject and the researcher. There is no doubt that research can be arduous in its undertaking; however it can be rewarding in the end.

In the Bangladeshi education system we come to be familiar with the term ""research"" at the tertiary level of education sometimes even after that i.e. during higher degree research such as MPhil or PhD.

It is quite unlikely for Bangladeshi primary or high school students to understand the meaning of the word ""research"" though some English medium schools are promoting research-based assignments activities and projects at school and hence they orient their students to research.

The departments across the Bangladeshi public universities that do not engage their students in their higher studies with any sort of research activities do harm to them in different ways.

First research is one of the primary missions of higher-education institutions like universities. A university accommodates the spirit of new knowledge formation its preservation and dissemination and research is a pedagogical mandate to meet this end.

If an educational entity aspires to the educational ideal of a university it must include a graded research assignment for its students. Without any research experience in their home university/department our Bangladeshi students often find it difficult to pursue the rigorous research demand in the Global North or in any higher degree institutions where a high standard of research is maintained.

To my knowledge the Department of English at the University of Chittagong has not yet included any research project or dissertation in its curriculum after almost 60 years of its inception. Such academic indifference does injustice to the bright students who intend to pursue higher degrees/studies. As a result we often lose many budding scholars.

Second research has effective consequences on our personality. Just as Francis Bacon referred to different disciplines as a remedy to our intellectual and characteristic needs research impacts our personality if taken and undertaken seriously and ethically.

While pursuing research a researcher must be patient assiduous and focused ‚Äî three characteristics that have a pragmatic impact on our personality and behaviour.

A good researcher tends to refrain from being judgemental and making hasty assumptions. The cognitive attention that a researcher invests in their work turns them into a curious investigator and keen observer of what happens around them.

Now the question is what impacts a researcher's research experience. Let's consider a few issues that impact a researcher's experience conducting research.

First and foremost is the research infrastructure and the research culture of an institution and/or department/school. In terms of global research impact indicators our universities and institutions have been struggling to level themselves to the international standard and the struggle goes on.

Why so? One of the prime reasons may be that we have not yet been able to create a research infrastructure. Having MRes (MA by research) MPhil or PhD programmes does not necessarily ensure a research infrastructure. The question is how these programmes are run and what institutional amenities we offer to the researchers to quench their scholarly thirst.

How many updated databases do our researchers get access to in order to be familiar with the more recent research findings or how many conferences seminars and workshops do we organise for our post-graduates to participate in?

How many research networks do we engage our researchers in? Do our researchers get proper guidelines regarding research conduct and progress? Do we help our researchers during or after their research i.e. during- or post-research publication? Do our supervisors or institutional higher degree infrastructure organise enough training sessions or workshops for the ECRs (Early Career Researchers) MCRs (Mid-Career Researchers) or researchers without any prior research exposure? The answer to this set of questions is quite frustrating.

In Bangladesh due to historical academic indifference towards research students undertaking research projects often find themselves helpless and at a loss. It's not that they are incapable just that they need some guidance about the research trajectory.

Doing academic research is a lone journey. Hence institutions and supervisors can be and should be the best support for the researchers.

Quite a few researchers working in Bangladeshi higher degree institutions drop out before completing the degree the reason being scared and not getting enough support from their peers and supervisors.

Three-year PhDs finishing in 6-8 years is a common perception about the Bangladeshi higher degree structure. Such a ""session jam"" is often caused by supervisory negligence; however the students' personal inconvenience and irregularity also come into such delays.

I personally know a few scholars who started their PhD in some reputed Bangladeshi universities and after 3-4 years they quit with utter frustration from not having enough academic support from the doctoral cohort or the institutions. Not being able to exorcise an uncanny fear about research often leads students to procrastinate and sometimes quit.

Procrastination be it institutional or personal has a risk too. For example the research topic someone is lingering on due to institutional or supervisory sluggishness might be taken up (knowingly or not) and completed/published by somebody else or some other institution before the researcher who initiated it first completes it.

Hence that researcher might need to change their topic which often poses a big psychological pressure on the researcher. Moreover procrastination may breed demotivation and intellectual disconnectedness. Sometimes even the supervisors don't even realise the question of the well-being and work-life balance of the researchers.

That leads to a crucial question of whether the supervisor themselves have a high degree of research experience. This question has an ethical dimension to it.

For instance can someone without a high degree (experience) supervise an MPhil or a PhD? Or should the same person be a member of the very powerful Higher Studies Committee of any entity? The answer is ‚Äîethically no; but in Bangladesh yes.

Do the research students have access to any space or mechanism to raise their voices regarding the qualification of their supervisors? No. Or even if yes the consequence has its psychological toll on the research students.

When it comes to ethical considerations in conducting and disseminating the research our students often find it an alien issue. What does ethics have to do with research? Well to put it simply just as plagiarism is an ethical issue in publication our methods of data collection might have a very serious impact on the research participants.

For example doing research with human participants might have a serious economic social and medical impact on them. To flesh it out more if I collect research data from a marginalised group of research participants my act of data collection might expose them to worse vulnerabilities. This is one of the reasons why we raise our voices against the capitalist pharmaceutical industries for their alleged clinical trials on the impoverished people of the Global South.

The only ethical guidelines for conducting research with human subjects available in Bangladesh is the one outlined by Bangladesh Medical Research Council (BMRC). However there are not any such ethical guidelines available on a national level or at the university level. Therefore whenever our researchers pursue research in collaboration with any Global North universities they must comply with their ethical guidelines.

We can start thinking about how to utilise the research outcomes of our researchers in national development. As academic and academic administrators it is our responsibility to create career opportunities for our researchers; otherwise like most of our PhD thesis the afterlife of research of our students will be the dusty corners of the libraries.

A massive restructuring of our research parameters and ensuring accountability and ethical conduct of research will not only embolden our academic structure but also help us create generations of responsible scholars.

Durham School Services the district‚Äôs bus contractor was four drivers short of the 125 drivers needed to cover the district‚Äôs planned 125 routes according to a memo from the district‚Äôs Transportation Supervisor Zachary Nicotera to school board members following his meeting with Durham officials on Tuesday.

But Durham has five drivers who may be ready to hit the road on the first day or soon after and it‚Äôs bringing two drivers in from the Schenectady area where the company has extra drivers the memo said. And the company should have enough drivers for all 125 routes within the first few weeks of school officials have said.

‚ÄúAll schools are routed‚Äù said Edward Flavin vice president of external communications for National Express Durham‚Äôs parent company. ‚ÄúWe are making minor adjustments to a few routes to cover all routes assigned until the last few positions are filled. We don‚Äôt expect any routes to go uncovered or operate anywhere near last year.‚Äù

That‚Äôs a big change from last year when Durham started out in September with only 62 drivers a local manifestation of a national school bus driver shortage. The company never got a full contingent of drivers during the 2021-22 school year its first year of operation in Utica. As a result many students arrived late for schools others got picked up late after school and some were left standing at their bus stops.

2021-22 school year:Bus company: Driver shortages leading to Utica school bus delays threats from parents

2021-22 school year:Utica school buses still running late but company still says it expects progress

The Utica Academy of Science Charter School pushed back its start time which was too early for buses that dropped off Utica city school students first. But students still frequently arrived late ‚Äï often considerably late ‚Äï throughout the year staff said.

But Hanka Grabovica regional student affairs officer said communication and cooperation with the district is better this year.

‚ÄúAs of now everything looks good and the way it should be‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAll of our students received a bus schedule of picking and dropping them off. Now we just have to wait and see how everything will work out.‚Äù School board members questioned Durham officials following a presentation on the driver situation at the board‚Äôs August meeting. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very concerned‚Äù Vice President Donald Dawes said ‚Äúabout kids being on a corner somewhere and not being picked up. ‚Ä¶ I was waiting all last year to hear that everyone was being picked up and I‚Äôm still waiting.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting very close‚Äù Brett Wester regional manager told him ‚Äúto a good position. ‚Ä¶ Where we‚Äôre at is manageable.‚Äù

School bus driver positions consistently difficult to fill

Districts across the state have been struggling to fill all kinds of positions within their schools this summer but bus drivers and substitute teachers have consistently been the hardest to fill according to the New York State Council of School Superintendents. Yet Durham has significantly increased its numbers.

Although the company is still a few drivers short officials think they‚Äôll have enough drivers on the first day of school to pick up students on time and more drivers after the first week or two of school Other details of plans include:

The district and the company will pool staff to make sure that all routes and after-school sports meets have drivers.

‚ÄúMop-up‚Äù buses stationed around Utica will pick up any students who get missed for some reason.

Durham has several drivers expected to be cleared any day: one who took the road test on Tuesday two waiting for medical clearance and two full licensed drivers who recently applied.

The district has been able to remove 113 students from bus routes because their parents have promised to drive them.

Newly elected board member James Paul is optimistic based on Durham‚Äôs work to recruit train and license drivers its cooperation with the district‚Äôs transportation department and its monthly updates to the board.

‚ÄúI believe‚Äù he said ‚Äúthat our students and families will see a substantial improvement in our transportation department.‚Äù

And the situation should keep getting better Durham officials stressed. Another eight to 10 drivers should be ready for the road in the next week or two Flavin said. Another 27 drivers are somewhere in the training pipeline Wester said.

The company is also still hiring to make sure it has enough substitutes and drivers for extracurricular activities.

Durham has made several changes this year that have helped it hire and retain more drivers Flavin said such as a 12.1 percent wage increase referral bonuses of between $500 and $1000 extensive advertising and publicity and a streamlined process for recruiting and training workers.

And the local Department of Motor Vehicles offices have stepped up he said to make sure candidates can get permitted and tested in a reasonable timeframe.

When Durham won the contract for the Utica schools one selling point was an app that lets parents track their child‚Äôs bus in real time. But with all the driver difficulties last year the app didn‚Äôt work.

But Durham plans on starting up its Bus Tracker app to show parents their children‚Äôs bus‚Äô estimated time of arrival once all the routes are firmly set hopefully in October Flavin said.

The app will also help the company let parents know about any busing issues he said.

CVX,Chevron Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vdmVuZXp1ZWxhbmFseXNpcy5jb20vbmV3cy8xNTU5NS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chevron Lobbies for Expanded Venezuela Oil License,"The multinational corporation needs permission from the US Treasury Department to ramp up its activities in Venezuela.

Caracas September 4 2022 (venezuelanalysis.com) ‚Äì US oil giant Chevron has reportedly applied for a broader license for its Venezuela operations.

With the Venezuelan economy and the oil sector in particular under heavy unilateral sanctions from the US Treasury Department all activities involving the Caribbean nation require special permission from Washington.

Chevron has a minimal license that runs out in November allowing the company to perform maintenance on its wells but not drill process or trade in Venezuelan crude. The company was forced to wind down its operations in 2020.

According to Reuters the California-based corporation is looking for an expanded sanctions waiver that will see it take greater control in joint ventures with Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA as well as ramp up production and resume sales of Venezuelan crude.

In May Chevron received permission to hold direct talks with PDVSA on kickstarting its activities. The two companies co-own four ventures with a total crude production capacity of about 200000 barrels per day (bpd).

Reuters claimed that the multinational oil firm is pushing for a crude-for-diluents swap that will boost production at the Petropiar crude upgrader. It also wants greater control over the ventures‚Äô operations human resources and oil trading while using sales to offset a reported $3 billion owed by PDVSA.

The revamped operations would not involve changing the stakeholding structure at the joint enterprises. Chevron has between 25 and 40 percent shares in its Venezuela ventures while the country‚Äôs legislation demands that PDVSA be the majority shareholder in all oil projects.

For its part Caracas has stated that ‚Äúthe ball is in the US‚Äô court‚Äù concerning an expansion of Chevron‚Äôs activities.

‚ÄúWe are ready. We have discussed and agreed with them everything related to the immediate restitution of operations. But it no longer depends on us‚Äù Venezuelan Oil Minister Tareck El Aissami said in a press conference.

Since 2017 Washington has levied a string of measures against the Venezuelan oil sector including financial sanctions an oil embargo and secondary sanctions. The US Treasury Department also blocked swap agreements while targeting and threatening international agents against dealing with the South American country.

The wide-reaching sanctions triggered a collapse of the country‚Äôs oil output which went from 1.9 million bpd before the 2017 measures all the way down to historic lows under 400000 bpd in the second half of 2020. Production bounced back but has been stuck around 700000 bpd for several months.

Both the Trump and Biden administrations have ignored widespread condemnation of the economic blockade. Multilateral organizations UN human rights rapporteurs solidarity groups and even US Democrat House members have called on the White House to undo the measures that have been classed as ‚Äúcollective punishment.‚Äù

However the global energy crisis triggered by the conflict in Ukraine saw Biden reengage with the Maduro administration.

Administration officials have claimed Washington is looking to encourage the Venezuelan government to re-open talks with the hardline opposition. While there has been little movement in that direction the US Treasury Department granted oil-for-debt licenses to Italy‚Äôs ENI and Spain‚Äôs Repsol in a bid to help European allies tackle fuel shortages and rising costs.

The two corporations carried several cargoes in June and July before shipments were reportedly suspended as PDVSA looks to expand the swaps and receive fuel as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Redmond was in Detroit on Friday to meet with local union officials and to prepare for the kickoff of the AFL-CIO‚Äôs new Permission to Dream program later this month. Redmond who has an extensive work history in the steel industry said what he observes right now is unlike anything he has seen previously in the labor movement.

‚ÄúI never remember a moment like this‚Äù said Redmond. ‚ÄúWhat is happening is very organic and at a grassroots level. Workers are independently standing up and we embrace that but we are also here to assist them and guide them through the process.‚Äù

The AFL-CIO is a voluntary federation of 57 national and international labor unions representing more than 12.5 million workers. Redmond said that number is growing in part due to the unionization of workers in industries that have been traditionally non-union. Retail restaurant and healthcare are just three areas where unions have experienced a surge of popularity.

Last month a Lansing Chipotle Mexican Grill became the first of the chain‚Äôs 3000 locations to unionize. Earlier this year 10 Michigan Starbucks locations ‚Äî including one in Clinton Township ‚Äî voted to unionize joining more than 130 Starbucks nationwide whose workers have organized.

‚ÄúThroughout the COVID pandemic workers in many industries realized they were the cog in the wheel that was driving business‚Äù said Redmond. ‚ÄúDuring the pandemic grocery workers were treated as essential workers but once we started moving back toward normality workers were being treated as if they were expendable. Workers have realized that the best way for them to have a voice is through collective action.‚Äù

Workers are not just seeking higher wages they are concerned about workplace safety and work/life balance as well.

‚ÄúWhat is driving this movement is that workers are feeling disrespected‚Äù said Redmond. ‚ÄúPeople are working an enormous amount of hours. We have teachers who feel threatened at work. Workers are at the point where they are fed up and are resigning in huge numbers. They‚Äôre not just looking for sufficient wages but things like child care paid leave and a consistent schedule.‚Äù

Redmond said the AFL-CIO is also working to bring workers from the alternative energy sector into the organized labor fold.

‚ÄúThere has been an expansion of wind turbine energy and solar power industries because of the effort to reduce emissions‚Äù said Redmond. ‚ÄúThese industries tend to pay low wages and have limited benefits and we would like to see the expansion of the union in these industries.‚Äù

He noted the UAW is working to establish its footprint in the electric vehicle industry as that becomes a bigger piece of the automotive industry as a whole.

‚ÄúThe UAW is at the table making progress and figuring out how they are going to operate in the future‚Äù said Redmond.

He has been disappointed by the extreme push back received from some businesses where workers are trying to organize unions. In his mind companies that do that misunderstand the goal of unions.

‚ÄúCollaboration is powerful and I think a lot of companies are missing the point‚Äù said Redmond. ‚ÄúIt is not our mission to destroy jobs or destroy the company profit margin it is about workers having a voice. When we have a voice we accomplish things.

‚ÄúBoth sides can sit down and discuss safety on the job and fair pay and fair work schedules in a way that is going to be sustainable for both the employee and the company.‚Äù

While disagreements between organized labor and employers are not unusual compromise happens at the bargaining table.

‚ÄúWe may disagree on some issues but we share the goal of making sure the company is profitable enough to provide good jobs to the community‚Äù said Redmond. ‚ÄúThe resistance we are seeing to organized labor from some companies particularly in the retail sector I believe to be related to corporate greed.‚Äù

Later this month Redmond will be back in Detroit to kick off the AFL-CIO‚Äôs Permission to Dream program that helps high school seniors have access to apprenticeship opportunities with local unions. There will be apprenticeships available for future plumbers electricians millwrights just to name a few.

Permission to Dream is meant to help raise the high school graduation rate for minorities by offering an alternative to costly traditional college education. The average rate of high school graduation for Black students in the United States is 77.5% compared to 89.2% for White students and 93.6% for Asian students.

‚ÄúIt is about putting students on a career path especially those in certain communities where they have felt locked out‚Äù said Redmond.

Redmond was elected to his position in June 2022 and is the highest ranking Black officer in the history of the American labor movement. AFL-CIO President Liz Schuler is the first female leader of the organization.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm excited about the future and the direction of the labor movement‚Äù said Redmond. ‚ÄúWe are trying to recognize the realities of diversity in the work force and help everyone find their voice in the movement.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlYnJhZy5jb20va2V2aW4tYmFjb24tam9pbnMtdmlyYWwtaXRzLWNvcm4tdHJlbmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kevin Bacon joins viral 'It's Corn' trend,"Kevin Bacon has added some star power to the viral ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs Corn‚Äô phenomenon picking up his guitar for a‚Ä¶ corny‚Ä¶ rendition of the song.

In a video posted to Instagram the actor performed an acoustic cover of the song soulfully singing the annoyingly catchy lyrics while strumming his guitar with a corn on the cob.

Bacon finishes the song taking a bite of the corn saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs corn.‚Äù

The ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs Corn‚Äô phenomenon began with web channel Recess Therapy interviewing a kid called Tariq about his favourite food.

The interview contained many meme-worthy quips from the six-year-old.

Soon enough The Gregory Brothers‚Äô Songify This made Tariq go even more viral by turning his interview into a catchy song.

The meme-making quips have soundtracked over 400000 TikTok videos. The official music video released last Sunday has already had over 2.1 million views on YouTube.

Watch the official ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs Corn‚Äô music video:

‚ÄúFor me I really like corn‚Äù Tariq says in the video.

‚ÄúWhat do you like about corn?‚Äù host Julian Shapiro-Barnum asks.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs corn! A big lump with knobs‚Ä¶ it has the juice‚Äù Tariq explains. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine a more beautiful thing.‚Äù

The song has gone so viral in fact the official TikTok account of TikTok has changed it‚Äôs bio to read ‚Äúit‚Äôs CORN.‚Äù

It isn‚Äôt the first time the Gregory Brothers have taken a viral moment and made it musical.

(Explained),"At some point many people have had Chipotle.

With a small menu consisting of Mexican-style food it can sound like traditional Mexican food but it has left many people confused.

Whether you are a regular at Chipotle or thinking about trying it for the first time you might be wondering what type of food Chipotle is.

Here is everything you need to know about Chipotle and what kind of food they serve.

What Kind Of Food Is Chipotle?

Chipotle is considered a Mexican-American restaurant.

It may seem like a Mexican restaurant with a limited menu of burritos bowls salads and tacos.

However Chipotle is thought of as a fast restaurant and is often referred to as Mexican-inspired with an American influence as it has no real roots in Mexican culture or cuisine.

Chipotle is not considered authentic Mexican food.

They use similar spice profiles and in general they serve Mexican-style dishes such as tacos and burritos.

However Chipotle is still considered an American restaurant.

Those who are familiar with authentic Mexican food would not consider Chipotle authentic Mexican and would think of it as Mexican-inspired.

If you are looking for authentic Mexican food then Chipotle would not be the restaurant of choice.

What Is The Difference Between Chipotle And Mexican Food?

Although Chipotle is Mexican-inspired there are key differences between Chipotle and authentic Mexican food.

If you are seeking traditional Mexican food you will notice that Chipotle is not the same.

The types of tortillas used are very different in authentic Mexican food and Chipotle.

Chipotle does not use homemade tortillas.

They typically use flour tortillas for tacos whereas traditional Mexican food uses corn tortillas for their tacos.

Chipotle does offer hard-shell corn tortillas which is common in authentic Mexican food.

When making traditional Mexican food they will use Cotija or Queso Blanco cheese but Chipotle uses shredded Cheddar or shredded Monterey Jack cheese.

Many of the sauces used in traditional Mexican food involve complex ingredients but Chipotle has simplified these so they are quick and easy to make.

Therefore they are not exactly like the sauces and salsas that are used in authentic Mexican food.

Is Chipotle Considered Fast Food?

Some people might refer to Chipotle as fast food but it is not fast food.

In the restaurant industry Chipotle is called fast casual.

This means that it is quick and convenient like fast food but it also offers the environment and quality of a sit-down restaurant.

You may hear Chipotle referred to as fast food or healthy fast food but it is technically not a fast food restaurant due to the dine-in experience that they offer.

It appeals to many people because you can use it as a fast food restaurant if you are wanting a quick meal but you can also dine in if you would rather take your time and eat in the restaurant.

Does Chipotle Serve Processed Food?

Chipotle is not considered processed food.

Their menu is simple and almost all of the food they offer is not processed or minimally processed.

They are proud to offer healthy alternatives to many fast food restaurants while not sacrificing flavor.

They gained nationwide attention by becoming the first national restaurant brand to no longer use added colors flavors or preservatives in their food.

Unlike many companies Chipotle released an ingredient statement that allows customers to view the specific ingredients in each food item they offer.

What Is The Best Thing To Order At Chipotle?

Everyone has different preferences for what they want to order at Chipotle.

Many people would argue that their personal favorite is the best thing to order.

However certain menu items have been more popular than others over the years.

One of the top menu items at Chipotle is the Barbacoa tacos.

Many people prefer to get them with a soft shell tortilla and minimal ingredients to make them truer to authentic Mexican food.

Another popular menu item is a burrito bowl with chicken.

The bowls have become a must-have for many people especially those who want a healthier option.

It is a great way to still get the deliciousness of Chipotle while eating something on the lighter side.

Perhaps coming in as the most popular item on their menu is the carnitas burrito.

Chipotle has always been known for its large burritos and the warm fresh tortillas make all the difference.

Their burritos can be customized with anything you wish to add and for some people the burrito is their go-to menu option every time.

Does Chipotle Use Real Meat?

Yes Chipotle does use real meat.

The only meat that is not considered real meat is their sofritas which is a plant-based protein that can be ordered in place of meat for those people who are vegetarian.

However Chipotle received an ‚ÄúA‚Äù rating from the Chain Reaction III Report and Scorecard which bases its review on antibiotic use in farm animals.

This means that Chipotle is responsibly sourcing their meat and using real meat that has not been treated with antibiotics or added hormones and has been raised in more humane ways.

For those people who are very conscious about the quality of meat that they consume they will lean more towards choosing Chipotle when trying to find a quick option for food because they have worked hard to only serve good quality meat.

What Other Restaurants Are Similar To Chipotle?

If you do not have a Chipotle in your area there are food options that are very similar to Chipotle and will have similar menu choices.

Restaurants such as Qdoba Baja Fresh Rubio‚Äôs and Moe‚Äôs Southwest Grill all offer similar options to Chipotle at around the same price point.

Although these restaurants are not identical to Chipotle and will have different foods as well as flavors they do share similarities and are a great alternative for those who love Chipotle.

Is Chipotle Better Than Qdoba?

Chipotle and Qdoba have some similarities but some differences may have some people expressing a preference for one over the other.

Over the last few years Chipotle has emphasized its slogan ‚Äúfood for integrity.‚Äù

They have prided themselves on food that is raised humanely and non-GMO.

However Qdoba has made their tagline ‚ÄúWhat are you going to love at Qdoba?‚Äù which means that their variety of flavors and items will leave an option for everyone.

They do have a more extensive menu than Chipotle does.

When it comes to the infamous guacamole at Chipotle Qdoba has the upper hand because they do not charge extra for guacamole.

Chipotle has caught some grief for charging extra for guacamole in the past.

Chipotle previously came out with queso and it quickly was removed from their menu.

However Qdoba has queso that has been loved by many.

They seem to have come out on top with regard to the queso on the menu.

In the end Chipotle and Qdoba have similarities when it comes to menu items but it comes down to personal preference as to which restaurant is better.

Some people will prefer the simplicity of Chipotle and the fact that they are non-GMO as well as the fact that they use meat with no added hormones.

However others might prefer the additional options that Qdoba offers and want to be able to have more menu options.

Are Chipotle And Taco Bell Similar?

A common comparison that is made between restaurants is people comparing Chipotle to Taco Bell.

However these two restaurants are vastly different.

Chipotle has a very limited menu compared to the very extensive Taco Bell menu.

Chipotle is going to be closer to authentic Mexican food than Taco Bell will.

Taco Bell is also considered a fast food restaurant whereas Chipotle is fast casual with the option to have a traditional sit-down dining experience.

Chipotle also uses all fresh ingredients with no added hormones but Taco Bell has never made a statement that says they do the same.

Overall the restaurants differ greatly and would not be considered similar.

Is Chipotle Still Owned By McDonald‚Äôs?

Those who are familiar with Chipotle and the background behind the company have probably heard about the involvement that McDonald‚Äôs had in the company.

However McDonald‚Äôs does not own Chipotle nor did they ever fully own the company.

When the company first began in the 1990s the founder Steve Ells needed some financial backing to help fund the company‚Äôs expansion.

It began as a small company in Denver Colorado.

McDonald‚Äôs took a minority stake in the company and invested in helping to expand Chipotle.

However by the time Chipotle became a publicly traded company in 2006 Mcdonald‚Äôs owned approximately 90% of the company.

Eventually McDonald‚Äôs sold their share of the company due to some differences of opinion on how Chipotle should be run and organized.

McDonald‚Äôs no longer has any stake in the company and does not own Chipotle.

Is Chipotle Healthy?

Chipotle is considered one of the healthier options when it comes to faster dining.

This is due to their fresh ingredients that are free of additives.

However even though they are considered a healthier option it can be easy to add up the calories on a Chipotle order depending on what you add to your order and how much you plan to eat.

Their portion sizes can be large especially when it comes to their burritos as they can end up at around 1000 calories.

It is important to keep that in mind if you are working to get healthier or lose weight.

What Is The Healthiest Thing To Eat At Chipotle?

If you are concerned about what you are eating and want to pick the healthiest option at Chipotle then a salad or bowl would be your best option.

You can add your meat of choice rice and beans.

Those who are wanting to be extremely health conscious may choose brown rice and black or pinto beans.

As far as the healthiest toppings for your salad or bowl your best options are going to be fajita veggies guacamole and salsa.

Toppings that you might want to add sparingly will include queso cheese sour cream and chips.

Chipotle can be as healthy or unhealthy as you make it.

That is one thing that appeals to many people about Chipotle.

It is customizable and although the menu is limited many people can find something to suit what they are looking for.

What Has Made Chipotle So Successful?

Chipotle is very well known and also well loved by many.

With a limited menu and a fast-casual environment some people might be left wondering why Chipotle has become so successful compared to other similar restaurants.

1. Highly Customizable

Although the menu is limited there are so many options to customize your order at Chipotle.

Whether you are looking for a healthy salad or a burrito you have the option to put certain toppings on the food.

If you are vegetarian gluten-free or just have a preference you can surely find something on the menu that can be customized to your needs.

2. Limited Menu

The limited menu at Chipotle might be looked at as a downfall but it is in reality a key to the success of the company.

They have a very limited number of items on their menu as well as limited ingredients.

The less food that they have to purchase means less food spoilage and waste.

It also allows Chipotle to spend money on fresher and better-quality food.

3. High-Quality Food

Due to the limited number of ingredients Chipotle has emphasized fresh ingredients and sourcing food that has no added hormones as well as meat that has been raised humanely.

This is an added benefit to customers and has made them a sought-after restaurant for those that are more health conscious.

4. Quick Service

The limited menu has also contributed to quick service.

There are only a handful of items that customers can order so those who are preparing the food will not have as many menu items to cook.

This leads to the ability to serve customers quickly and efficiently which has contributed to the success of the restaurant.

Whether you order the food from the restaurant in person or online you are almost always guaranteed to get quick but excellent service.

5. Reasonable Prices

Chipotle is known for having larger portion sizes and many people often split a single meal into two meals which can make it more worthwhile for the cost.

Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Chicago has been around for 125 years and acted as the primary church for three surrounding neighborhoods of Ashland Avenue.

The church held its first mass in October 1892 and was physically moved in 1929.

It took the efforts of 50 men and their horses to pry the 10000 ton church from its foundation move it across the street and rotate it 90 degrees. According to a Chicago Ancestry site the church was moved at a 'foot a minute.'

'It is a magnificent historically and architecturally significant church' said church preservation advocate Julie Sawacki on the steps leading to the church's entrance. 'Imagine tearing something so significant down.'

The front fa√ßade of Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Chicago. The historic building faces certain destruction if $2 million isn't raised for repairs. The archdiocese says there's no viable plan to raise the massive amount of funds

The church in its present form was built in 1916 and moved across a street by 50 men and horses in 1929

The Archdiocese of Chicago told CBS News that attendance at the church's Sunday masses have steadily declined.

The church simultaneously needs $2 million worth of repairs and without the community's support its likely it will be demolished.

There are a group of parishioners including Hilda Correa who are desperately trying to save the famed religious landmark. Correa and others say the church attracts tourists both Christian and non-Christian.

Correa also alluded to the fact that times are hard. Although she didn't specify what she was talking about - perhaps the years-long pandemic or stubborn inflation - Correa says the church is a place of comfort for those who come to visit.

Hilda Correa left and Julie Sawacki right as well as a number of others passionate about keeping Our Lady of Lourdes alive made impassioned pleas on the steps of the church before its last service on May 19

'The religious aspect is really what's really touching us because losing such a valuable place that people can come especially in these days...'

Our Lady of Lourdes will be holding its final service on May 19 but Preservation Chicago a non-profit organization dedicated to saving city landmarks plans to revive the church and make it into a holy shrine.

'The effort here will probably be long and labored perhaps. There's a lot of different moving parts and a lot of different factors' said Preservation Chicago Executive Director Ward Miller.

There is a Change.org petition with 1107 signatures to preserve the church as a historical landmark rather than knocking it down. The goal is to reach 1500 signatures.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20uY2h1cmNob2ZqZXN1c2NocmlzdC5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZS9jaHVyY2gtb2YtamVzdXMtY2hyaXN0LXJlc3BvbmRzLXRvLW1ham9yLWZsb29kaW5nLWluLXJpby1ncmFuZGUtZG8tc3VsLWJyYXppbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Church of Jesus Christ Responds to Major Flooding in Rio Grande Do Sul Brazil,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /article/church-of-jesus-christ-responds-to-major-flooding-in-rio-grande-do-sul-brazil (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016712937A60>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20uY2h1cmNob2ZqZXN1c2NocmlzdC5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZS9jaHVyY2gtb2YtamVzdXMtY2hyaXN0LXJlc3BvbmRzLXRvLW1ham9yLWZsb29kaW5nLWluLXJpby1ncmFuZGUtZG8tc3VsLWJyYXppbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9hZHZpY2UvMjAyNC8wNS8xMC9jYXJvbHluLWhheC1pbi1sYXdzLWxpdmUtc3RyZWFtLWNodXJjaC1hdHRlbmRhbmNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Advice | Carolyn Hax: In-laws stalk the live stream to check couple's attendance at church,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.washingtonpost.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /advice/2024/05/10/carolyn-hax-in-laws-live-stream-church-attendance/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016712934070>, 'Connection to www.washingtonpost.com timed out.

PHOTOGRAPH PROVIDED BY MAZUNTE

The new canned cocktail was developed using Mazunte‚Äôs classic margarita recipe using Karrikin‚Äôs Blaze which is fermented and distilled locally from 100 percent Blue Weber agave nectar imported from Jalisco Mexico. It also features Karrikin‚Äôs homemade Triple Sec.

‚ÄúWe had been discussing and exploring the best way to grow our brand by finding a way to offer our margarita outside of our brick-and-mortar locations‚Äù says John Johnston chief financial officer of Mazunte Taqueria Mazunte Centro and Mazunte Catering. ‚ÄúThis is difficult with us not being a distiller or alcohol distributor.‚Äù

Enter Jeff Hunt from Karrikin. The Fairfax-based craft distillery‚Äôs cofounder Johnston and Josh Wamsley Mazunte‚Äôs chief executive officer put their heads together to bring the product to fruition. The result is an elevated product with better ingredients Johnston notes.

‚ÄúWe hope this product is an extension of our brand through retail outlets with a new product offering to our current and new customers‚Äù he adds. ‚Äú[And] the nice part for them is they have an immediate large customer in us with our two restaurant locations.‚Äù

The canned margarita will be sold as a four pack of 12-ounce cans for a suggested retail price of $13.99. Karrikin and Ohio Valley Wine & Beer will act as distributors to retail outlets.

You can celebrate the release with the Mazunte crew this weekend during a release party from 2 to 10 p.m. on Saturday Sept. 10 at Karrikin Spirits (3717 Jonlen Dr. Fairfax).

Gustavo Arnal was hired by Bed Bath & Beyond in May 2020 and credited with helping get the New Jersey-based retail giant through the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic the company said in a statement Sunday.

The exec came aboard as chief financial officer and executive vice president after ‚Äúa distinguished global career in finance‚Äù that included working at ‚Äúseveral other well-known businesses‚Äù the company stated Sunday.

Arnal came from cosmetic company Avon where he was also named the executive vice president and CFO starting in spring 2019 according to the Cincinnati Business Courier. He was at Walgreens Boots Alliance before that serving as senior vice president and CFO of international divisions and global functions the Business Courier said.

Both of those gigs were based in London.

But most of his career was at Procter & Gamble where he spent 20 years holding various positions and working with brand names including Pringles potato chips and Tide detergent.

The husband and father of two adult daughters was CFO of the company‚Äôs India Middle East and Africa business where he oversaw operations in more than 50 countries the Cleveland Business Journal reported in May 2020.

When Arnal was announced as Bed Bath & Beyond‚Äôs newest hire he said the company had to build ‚Äúon the strong foundations of this business with a new robust and sustainable business model‚Äù the Cleveland Business Journal reported.

He also reportedly said he looked forward to working as a ‚Äúcatalyst for the cultural and financial change in the business.‚Äù

But the housewares company has struggled mightily recently and is expected to close 150 stores and terminate 20% of its workforce after an announcement about its restructuring came days before his death.

Arnal was also included in a recent lawsuit that accuses him Chewy.com founder Ryan Cohen and others of artificially inflating the retail‚Äôs share price.

The class action was filed Aug. 23 in Washington DC.

The company‚Äôs board of directors chairman Harriet Edelman said in part of a statement Sunday about the shocking death ‚ÄúOur focus is on supporting his family and his team and our thoughts are with them during this sad and difficult time. Please join us in respecting the family‚Äôs privacy.‚Äù

PLAINVIEW ‚Äì Gaylon Glynn threw for 298 yards and four touchdowns and Cooper grad Noah Garcia ran for two more plus had a TD catch from Glynn as No. 6 Hardin-Simmons blasted NAIA Wayland Baptist 79-14 in the season football opener Saturday at Bulldog Stadium.

Garcia a freshman transfer from Cisco College ran for 122 yards on six carries in his Cowboys debut including an 89-yard TD run for his first score.

Garcia Cooper‚Äôs all-time leading rusher also had two catches for 32 yards ‚Äì one a 22-yarder for a TD.

Wylie grad Gatlin Martin returned a fumble 20 yards on the game's opening possession and he caught a 7-yard pass from Glynn for another.

Another Wylie player Grayson Bearden kicked a 25-yard field to give HSU a 45-0 lead as time expired in the first half and converted all 10 PAT attempts.

Glynn who completed 17 of 24 passes without an interception also threw 39-yard TD pass to Kevi Evans and A.J. Hawkins ran for TDs of 7 and 40 yards for the Cowboys (1-0).

The Pioneers (0-1) trailed 58-0 before Damon Ford ran 32 yards for a TD with 7:16 left in the third quarter and Bryan Ponder threw a 28-yard TD pass to Kamron Williams for the game‚Äôs penultimate score early in the fourth quarter.

HSU amassed 642 yards including 332 passing while holding the Pioneers to 209 total yards ‚Äì just 82 rushing. The Cowboys also got interceptions from Tre Allen and Brock Bujnoch.

HSU scored on its first four possessions after Martin's pick for a TD and five of its first six drives.

The Cowboys have a bye this week before going to Wisconsin-Platteville on Sept. 17. Platteville also known as the Pioneers lost to Michigan Tech 23-13 on Thursday. The Pioneers play Bethel (Minnesota) on Saturday at Pioneer Stadium

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has extended the reach of its national IT education initiative to encompass five more government teaching institutions to which the bank recently donated fully equipped IT labs and where necessary conducted building renovations.



The latest beneficiaries of the bank‚Äôs flagship corporate social responsibility programme are the Kudagammana Maha Vidyalaya in Walpita Karunarathna College in Kotadeniyawa Thawalampitiya Maha Vidyalaya and Henepola Vidyaloka Vidyalaya in Mirigama and the Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka (VTA) in Rajagiriya.

The bank‚Äôs donations included computers and chairs printers and multimedia projectors. In addition the bank also invested in the renovation and expansion of the existing IT lab facilities at some of these institutions.



While the schools cater to students from grades 1to 13 and require IT labs to teach ICT which is a compulsory subject in the curriculum the VTA needed 10 new computers to ensure the continuation of the twice-weekly computer courses currently conducted for 30 students.



Beside steadfastly continuing with the donation of fully-equipped IT labs the bank which is one of the largest contributors towards IT education in Sri Lankaalso supporteda project to set up 100 classrooms that focus on the STEM subjects and is funding projects to set up math labs in schools and to enhance vocational training opportunities for students that do not qualify for higher education.



Additionally Commercial Bank is funding a 150-hour IT hardware course conducted in collaboration with the Academy for ICT Skills and Development and CISCO Networking Academy in selected schools. While the CISCO Networking Academy provides the course fee free-of-charge for the students the bank sponsors the lecture fee of the course. The bank has also supported the ‚ÄòIT Essentials-Instructor‚Äô certificate course for teachers at the CISCO Networking Centre at the University of Moratuwa under this programme.",,,,,,

One of the programs will get credit cards to those without credit scores and the other will assist small businesses with minority women or veteran owners to get credit. Participation in Project REACh is a part of Citigroup‚Äôs $1 billion in strategic initiatives to help close the racial wealth gap and increase economic mobility in the United States according to the company‚Äôs press release.

Project REACh already works with several banks like JPMorgan Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp sharing bank account data to approve more borrowers for credit cards.

The issue of the credit-underserved is a big one in the U.S. with around 50 million residents lacking traditional credit scores. Banks usually look at credit scores when reviewing applications for various kinds of consumer debt.

The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) wrote that information about an applicant‚Äôs income and spending habits can be as good a measure of creditworthiness as traditional credit scores.

Efforts to help the underserved have cropped up elsewhere recently including the White House debut of a new Economic Opportunity Coalition (EOC) to look at economic disparities PYMNTS wrote.

The coalition will look into investments for communities of color while the Biden-Harris administration will also invest. The EOC will be working between public private and social sector organizations to marshal and direct resources.

The areas of focus will include investing in community development financial institutions (CDFIs) and minority depository institutions (MDIs) supporting entrepreneurs and minority-owned businesses more access to credit and better infrastructure and housing for underserved neighborhoods.

While the regular season is still far from over the playoff picture in the National League is mostly wrapped up. The Mets Braves Dodgers and Cardinals are all but certain to earn a postseason berth and the Phillies Padres and Brewers are fighting for the final two spots.

In order for Philadelphia to make the playoffs they only have to outplay one of those two teams. And thankfully they already have a pretty big edge on the competition: the tiebreaker.

When Major League Baseball introduced the third Wild Card spot ahead of the 2022 season the league eliminated its one-game tiebreaker format.



With more postseason games to play there is no longer time to allow for tiebreaker contests. Instead if there is any sort of tie after 162 games are up it will be resolved using the teams' head-to-head records against one another.

The Phillies have already finished their season series against both the Padres and the Brewers and they came out on top in each one. They have the better head-to-head record against both of their closest Wild Card competitors.

Philadelphia dropped two games to Milwaukee in mid-April but swept the Brewers six weeks later in a three-game set at American Family Field. They won the season series four games to two.

Similarly they welcomed the Padres to Citizens Bank Park in May and lost two of three. When the Phillies journeyed to San Diego the following month however they won three of four taking the season series four games to three.

This means Philadelphia essentially has a one-game cushion in the Wild Card race. In the case of a tie for the third Wild Card spot they would automatically receive a postseason berth.

In any previous year the Phillies would have to play a one-game winner-takes-all playoff for a chance at October baseball. They would have to burn their best available starting pitcher and the team would lose a day of rest too.

The new tiebreaker format therefore could wind up working out quite nicely for Philadelphia. In the case of a tie they'll stroll right into the playoffs.

The Major League Baseball season is a long one. With so many games to play it often doesn't feel like each individual game matters all that much especially those in the early months of the season.

This year however those seven games in mid-June in which Philadelphia clinched the season series against San Diego and Milwaukee could turn out to be very meaningful after all.

The Phillies have already won the tiebreaker against their two biggest threats. That's a big deal. It gives them a huge advantage and it could very well be the difference between another disappointing season for Philadelphia and their first postseason appearance in over a decade.

One billion people across the globe lack an official proof of identity essential for financial and social inclusion. One in two women in low-income countries does not have an ID limiting their access to critical services and participation in political and economic life.These are the findings of a 2018 World Bank Identification for Development Initiative report that highlights global identification challenges.A country‚Äôs identification system is the backbone for effective delivery of public and private services.Governments across the world are exploring ways to develop a multipurpose foundational ID system in which individuals receive a unique identifier that they can use for identity assertion and verification.This is where the Modular Open Source Identity Platform MOSIP ) comes in.The MOSIP story began when the World Bank approached the International Institute of Information Technology-Bangalore (IIIT-B) a technology university in Bengaluru for an open-source foundational identity system on which national IDs could be built.MOSIP is a modular and open-source identity platform that helps user organisations such as governments implement a digital foundational ID in a cost-effective manner.So far more than 71.7 million people are registered on MOSIP-based systems across the globe.The foundational ID is intended to be used for access to a wide variety of government and private services.As countries consider how best to build foundational ID systems they face several policy and technological choices.Once these choices are made countries often grapple with some common implementation challenges. These include ensuring uniqueness in the system interoperability privacy by design reaching scale avoiding vendor lock-in and maintaining affordability.In response to these challenges the IIIT-B is anchoring the MOSIP project since 2018 as a global public good Professor Debabrata Das director of IIIT-B and chairman of the executive committee of MOSIP told ET.This is an effort that is being funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) Tata Trust Omidyar Network Pratiksha Trust and Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad) which have cumulatively provided Rs 150 crore. Infosys co-founder Kris Gopalakrishnan's Pratiksha Trust has also committed $1 million to the project.‚ÄúThe project mainly started due to the success of Aadhaar which became globally renowned as many citizen-centric services were based on it. When the World Bank approached the government for Aadhaar it could not be shared as it was a proprietary technology. Then it approached IIIT-B to develop an equivalent of Aadhaar‚Äù Das said.The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) was set up to issue Unique Identification Numbers (UID) named Aadhaar to all residents of India.MOSIP was created because of its customizability configurability and modularity Kanwaljit Singh senior program officer financial services for the poor BMGF told ET.BMGF has contributed $10 million to MOSIP so far.‚ÄúThe issue was Aadhaar was customized to the Indian context. Aadhaar was built for a scale of a billion people‚Äù Singh said.All the design choices that went into Aadhaar were made with India in mind.The design choices must be very different when designing a system that should work for a country with a population of one million to a country whose population is 100 million he added.MOSIP is currently being used in countries with populations as diverse as Sri Lanka Togo Guinea Ethiopia Morocco the Philippines and Sierra Leone.‚ÄúBecause it doesn't have to work for a billion people or it must be working at a small enough scale so that it can be speedy scalable and efficiently deployable. And it must be customizable‚Äù Singh said.For example the population of Samoa is 300000 Maldives is 550000 and Bermuda 72000 for which IIIT-B is trying to develop different ID systems like MOSIP Lite because these countries don‚Äôt need huge data centres and the cost per head can be brought down.So far in the Philippines 71 million citizens have been registered using MOSIP of which 50 million have been issued identity cards. In Morocco out of a population of 36 million 150000 have been issued unique identity numbers.Customising the system to a local context is unique to MOSIP.In Morocco for instance the whole system had to be customized to local needs because the predominant language there is Arabic.Moreover ID systems must comply with local legislation.The Philippines is a country of 7000 islands and seamless internet connectivity was a challenge. Similarly Morocco also had remote mountain areas where mobile networks were a challenge.So IIIT-B came up with offline authentication where the ID is downloaded in low-end Android phones as a QR code and this could be shown to shopkeepers or banks.They could locally authenticate without having to go to a server in the absence of a mobile network.In the works is a selfie-based authentication system for the elderly to avail of pension which Morocco has specifically requested.‚ÄúWhile it is left to the countries whether to capture biometrics or not the uniqueness of a person can be captured only with biometrics. Other identifiers like name date of birth and address can be given by multiple people‚Äù Professor S Rajagopalan president MOSIP IIIT-B told ET.Countries can issue identification numbers without biometrics too.In Morocco for example only the face and the iris scans are captured.Under Moroccan law fingerprints have to be captured only by the police.In the Philippines fingerprints iris and face scans are captured.Voice biometrics is an area that is still being tested which will be rolled out in about two years.‚ÄúThere are one billion people in the world who have no way of proving who they are. And this is a dire and urgent need. There are 1.7 billion people who are excluded from the formal financial system and one of the reasons for that exclusion is their inability to prove who they are‚Äù Singh of BMGF told ET.Omidyar Network one of the initial backers has so far provided $4 million to MOSIP.The grant agreement was for four years and Omidyar Network is evaluating how to continue supporting the project once the agreement ends this year.‚ÄúThere was a need for a large-scale digital identity technology architecture because many countries wanted to replicate the India example particularly in Africa‚Äù Govind Shivkumar director responsible technology Omidyar Network told ET.Historically most technology vendors were private proprietary companies.‚ÄúMany African and other countries have had issues with their data being locked in with a specific vendor and hence there was a need for an open-source digital identity platform‚Äù he said.The principles of a good ID system are inclusivity accountability privacy and security. MOSIP has technological attributes built in to avoid abuse of these principles.The virtual ID feature offered by MOSIP enables a revocable identity and prevents stealing of identity as the unique identification number stays with the individual and the government. It is not shared with a third party. Instead a virtual ID is shared which can be revoked after a certain period.‚ÄúWe have had many cases where MOSIP has refused to work with certain actors and Omidyar Network has supported that because some of the human rights attributes democratic values privacy and security attributes were not there‚Äù Shivkumar said.The Alan Turing Institute UK‚Äôs national institute for data science and artificial intelligence has looked for vulnerabilities in MOSIP‚Äôs code and fixed them he added.Singh of BMGF said that there had been a big inefficiency in how ID systems were being built. One of the biggest problems that African countries had was a lack of an ID system.Uganda Nigeria Samoa and Tunisia are among countries that have shown interest in MOSIP.The possibility of vendor lock-in at the hands of the private sector was leading to many inefficiencies and ultimately ‚Äúit was the money of the people that was being wasted‚Äù he said.‚ÄúSo the Foundation felt that there was a need to fund an open-source digital public infrastructure which many governments could take and implement customize it to their local conditions and then use it to provide service to their people. So MOSIP was designed with that in mind‚Äù Singh added.The ID systems should be designed not only to include the poor but also to benefit them by addressing the risks of exclusion he pointed out.The idea was to set an example based on principles of code identification security privacy ethics and fairness. ‚ÄúMany countries have come forward and we are seeing more demand for MOSIP as it goes out into the world‚Äù he said.MOSIP has more than 60 commercial partners from system integrators software providers to biometric device providers. ‚ÄúSo it's really an ecosystem approach. You really need the private sector‚Äù Singh added.Any system that handles personally identifiable information - whether it is a tax database or health database - invariably leads to questions about privacy and security. MOSIP‚Äôs answer to this is a ‚Äòzero knowledge architecture‚Äô.‚ÄúIt basically means the system does not have any memory‚Äù Prof Rajagopalan said.First a device must be authenticated saying it is genuine. Second the application should also be authenticated saying it is correct and third the content or data should also be authenticated every time a transaction takes place.This is known as the zero-knowledge architecture so that there is no possibility of fraud or theft.There are many challenging scenarios that MOSIP‚Äôs ‚Äòprivacy and security by design‚Äô document looks at.These include internal attacks external threats terrorist internal civil war offline registration online/offline verification ability to revoke ability to quarantine and isolate upon attacks or compromise response to security attack/threats challenges with 360-degree profiling ‚Äì privacy and challenges on non tech-savvy users and multi-lingual users.‚ÄúMerely because one modifies the code doesn‚Äôt mean you can get access to the live system in a production environment. We have put many security safeguards in place to avoid a breach‚Äù Rajagopalan said.MOSIP has a Hardware Security Manager (HSM) which is based on multiple keys. These keys are available only to a few people based on their respective roles. So even people who have permission to access the system cannot access the entire system. They can access only a part of the system.",,,

I remember a day in our first several years when it was raining squirrels. That afternoon I had gone to wake one of our children from their nap.

Quite proud of the work the culprit stood tall in a now graffitied crib and smiled at me as if I might consider purchasing the masterpiece.

After a bath (and 78 Clorox wipes) we settled down for dinner and family worship. The artist was quite hungry as I recall. We put the kids down for bed prayed against any further creative endeavors and went to sleep. A couple hours later we woke to another distraught child who had peed the bed for the first time in months. Count it all joy fellow parents when you meet moisture of various kinds. After a bath (and a few less Clorox wipes) this child too was clean and back in bed again. It was a little after two o‚Äôclock in the morning.

I crawled back into bed closed my eyes and started inventing a preemptive snooze button. Seconds later the painter started crying again. I took a deep breath and swung my feet out of bed. As I approached I could smell trouble again but not the same trouble. My child had as kids are strangely wont to do eaten too much too fast causing a digestive uprising. Cue the Clorox wipes.

As my wife Faye and I laid back in bed somewhere between two and three in the morning knowing we‚Äôd have to get up and feed the squirrels in a couple hours we couldn‚Äôt help but laugh. Bleary-eyed and defeated we looked at each other smiled and agreed ‚ÄúWant to have another one?‚Äù

Children Need Us to Struggle

Every parent has stories like mine. Raising children is predictably hard in unpredictable ways. We rarely know what hard will look like tomorrow or next week or in five years but we can be reasonably sure it won‚Äôt be easy.

This is obviously intentional on God‚Äôs part. He knows what our kids need most is not parents who parent relatively easily but parents who must rely on God each day. They need to see parents of clay regularly tiring sinning confessing repenting pleading for forgiveness strength and help while still trusting and enjoying God. They need to see how we endure hard with hope in him.

Satan however preys on all the painful aspects of parenting. He has studied our vulnerabilities and waits to attack in our weakest moments. He makes it all seem so trivial so unrewarding so futile. When his temptations come (and they will come) it‚Äôs important that another voice rings louder than his in our frustrated and exhausted ears.

Behold children are a heritage from the Lord

the fruit of the womb a reward.

Like arrows in the hand of a warrior

are the children of one‚Äôs youth. (Psalm 127:3‚Äì4)

1. Does Parenting Feel Trivial?

This may be the loudest lie about children in our society today: There are so many bigger more productive more important things you could be doing than raising kids. Parenting is too small for you.

Parenting is small in many everyday ways but it‚Äôs enormous in the ways that really matter. ‚ÄúBehold children are a heritage from the Lord‚Äù ‚Äî a gift an inheritance a legacy. We should pay close attention to what God calls a heritage because he claimed one for himself: ‚ÄúBlessed is the nation whose God is the Lord the people whom he has chosen as his heritage!‚Äù (Psalm 33:12). We are his heritage ‚Äî ‚Äúa chosen race a royal priesthood a holy nation a people for his own possession‚Äù (1 Peter 2:9). And children ‚Äî biological adopted or spiritual ‚Äî are our heritage.

Whenever God gives a child he‚Äôs entrusting us with a precious and eternal heritage ‚Äî a new life that will never end and that Lord willing will grow to change and shape the world in all kinds of ways (maybe even having children of their own). Their impact on eternity will easily outweigh whatever work the world holds up as more meaningful and consequential.

2. Does Parenting Feel Futile?

Maybe parenting doesn‚Äôt feel small at all; maybe it feels big and overwhelming and at times demoralizing. She‚Äôs still not potty-trained. He still won‚Äôt sit still. She throws her food on the ground nearly every meal. He throws a fit whenever mom says no. They still can‚Äôt play together for three minutes without fighting. Is anything I‚Äôm doing making a difference? Am I doing more harm than good? Is all this effort just a colossal failure?

‚ÄúIn God‚Äôs eyes children are some of the most effective weapons for the most important battles.‚Äù

Kids can make life feel like a sack race through a thick forest. That‚Äôs what we see and feel (and often smell). But what does God say? ‚ÄúLike arrows in the hand of a warrior are the children of one‚Äôs youth.‚Äù From the high ground of heaven we see that children are not distractions from the war or weights around our ankles; they‚Äôre sharpened shafts of victory waiting to be unleashed for good. In God‚Äôs eyes children are some of the most effective weapons for the most important battles. That‚Äôs why when God made the world and put that first man and woman to work he didn‚Äôt say find a career or build a business but ‚ÄúBe fruitful and multiply and fill the earth‚Äù (Genesis 1:28).

Fill the earth with what? With faithful wise joyful arrows. Nothing could be more spiritually effective or significant than having children and preparing them well for eternity.

3. Does Parenting Feel Unrewarding?

Parenting can feel at times like all cross and no reward. Our sin says What am I getting out of all this work and sacrifice and dirty laundry? What do I have to show for all I‚Äôve given? The Lord says ‚ÄúBehold‚Äù ‚Äî look! ‚Äî ‚Äúchildren are a heritage from the Lord the fruit of the womb a reward‚Äù ‚Äî a prize an honor a bounty. Children are the reward for having children.

‚ÄúChildren are the reward for having children.‚Äù

We miss the reward in raising children when we start looking for the reward somewhere other than children. We want efficiency. We want accomplishment. We want a salary. We want recognition. Instead God gives us eternal souls to steward and shepherd. He doesn‚Äôt reward us according to the desires of our fallen misguided restless earthly hearts; he rewards us according to reality. While millions are feverishly building towers that will crumble and fall in a generation the wise are receiving and raising souls who will live forever.

When your career has come to a close would you trade any amount of success or fame for even just one of those souls? The reward may seem small when you‚Äôre drowning in bottles and diapers but like our babies it won‚Äôt seem small for long.

Blessed Is This Man

As I write we‚Äôre waiting to meet another arrow in a matter of days the third in our filling quiver. He elbows me when I hold Faye‚Äôs belly (I assume out of an already budding and abiding affection). As we‚Äôve prayed for him it‚Äôs dawned on me with greater and greater meaning and joy that he‚Äôll be our first to be born in a post-Roe America. His life will be something of a memorial to a long and awful regime of death. Maybe abortion will become unthinkable in his lifetime.

We don‚Äôt know how many lives will be saved by the Dobbs decision but we can rejoice that abortion will be that much more difficult for many. Having a baby seems like one especially fitting way to celebrate. Despite what our society has screamed for decades it‚Äôs a deeply happy thing to have a baby:

Blessed is the man

who fills his quiver with them!

He shall not be put to shame

when he speaks with his enemies in the gate. (Psalm 127:5)

This happiness isn‚Äôt light and fragile like worldly happiness. Children sweeten a father‚Äôs life and work for sure but they also arm him to keep living and working and loving. They give him a more durable and resilient joy. Those who oppose him can‚Äôt upset him as easily or take advantage of him anymore. Satan himself shudders before our sons and daughters. After all he knows just how much good a child can do.

So when the hours of sleep are few and the number of diapers and Clorox wipes great remember what God says about parenting. Learn to love and rejoice in your children like he loves and rejoices in you.",,,,,,,,,,,,

India is planning a massive expansion of green hydrogen production to curb its dependence on energy imports and to wean the economy off fossil fuels to meet climate targets.New Delhi is aiming for an annual production capacity of 25 million tons by 2047 according to people familiar with the plans who didn‚Äôt want to be named as the information is not yet public. However the number could change going forward depending on technology and the country‚Äôs demand outlook they said. Media officials at the power and renewable energy ministries didn‚Äôt immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.Green hydrogen is widely expected to play a major role in decarbonizing heavy industries including oil refineries steel mills and fertilizer plants. India‚Äôs current output of the fuel is very low and comes from a handful of pilot projects.While green hydrogen is regarded as a potential panacea to cut emissions there are still major challenges in scaling up the technology and making it cost-effective. It‚Äôs not certain demand growth will materialize and the fuel may not become the first choice in transport and industry.The potential to generate low-cost renewable energy in India the world‚Äôs third biggest emitter of greenhouse gases has been a driving force behind the government‚Äôs carbon-free hydrogen ambitions. India‚Äôs goal of getting to net zero by 2070 has found support from business tycoons including Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani  as well as state-run energy giants like NTPC Ltd . and Indian Oil Corp Adani has pledged to spend $70 billion on clean energy assets including green hydrogen while Ambani‚Äôs Reliance Industries Ltd . one of India‚Äôs most valuable companies plans to add production of solar panels electrolyzers for clean hydrogen and rechargeable batteries. French oil giant TotalEnergies SE has agreed to partner with Adani on hydrogen in India.The government is considering more ways to spur the sector including offering production-linked incentives to make electrolyzers.Green hydrogen is made by splitting hydrogen and oxygen in water with the help of electrolyzers powered by renewable electricity. The product can replace the use of hydrogen derived from some fossil fuels in refineries and fertilizer plants. It has the potential to become an alternative to coal in steel mills and oil products in long-haul transport.The green hydrogen targets are part of a broader strategy for 2047 the centenary year of India‚Äôs independence. The plan also includes measures to improve energy efficiency overhaul power markets and expand manufacturing of renewable energy equipment according to the people.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkvYmhvcGFsL3NtYXJ0LWNpdHktZW5lcmd5LXNhdmluZy1iaWQtbGVhdmVzLWJob3BhbC1pbi1kYXJrL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkzOTc3NzE5LmNtc9IBf2h0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkvYmhvcGFsL3NtYXJ0LWNpdHktZW5lcmd5LXNhdmluZy1iaWQtbGVhdmVzLWJob3BhbC1pbi1kYXJrL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85Mzk3NzcxOS5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Smart city ‚Äòenergy saving‚Äô bid leaves Bhopal in dark,BHOPAL: Some undesirable energy saving practices adopted by Bhopal Smart City Development Corporation Limited ( BSCDCL ) are leaving the state capital in the dark.

Sat 03 Sep 2022



Jack McVey scored just before the whistle to seal a draw for the Ravens

FC Isle of Man have scraped another point in the North West Counties Football League Premier Division with home draw at the Bowl.

Playing Barnoldswick Town the Ravens set the mood with an early goal from Stephen Whitley just 5 minutes in.

Barnoldswick returned in the 22nd minute with a goal from Kuda Chingwaro but Lee Gale put the pressure back on the visitors in the 33rd minute as they went in to the break 2-1 up.

The second half Barnoldswick appeared the better side and the Ravens conceded two further goals one in the 79th minute from Barnoldswick's Gareth Hill and a second goal for Chingwaro.

Another defeat was then on the cards but in the dying minutes of extra time the Ravens Jack McVey sealed a 3-3 draw from a penalty and a point for FC Isle of Man.

SAN FRANCISCO - The cryptocurrency industry has endured a terrible year. A devastating crash wiped nearly $1 trillion from the market draining the savings of thousands of people. Several companies filed for bankruptcy.Now the industry is fixated on a potential saving grace: a long-awaited software upgrade to the most popular cryptocurrency platform ethereum  which provides the technological backbone for thousands of crypto projects. The upgrade - known as the Merge - has gained near-mythical status after years of delays that left some insiders questioning whether it would ever happen.But if all goes according to plan the Merge will take place around Sept. 15 more than eight years after it was initially discussed. The change would shift ethereum to a more energy-efficient infrastructure addressing the widespread criticism that crypto's climate effect outweighs its possible benefits. And it would lay the foundation for future upgrades to reduce the hefty fees required to conduct transactions in Ether the platform's signature currency and the second-most valuable digital asset after bitcoin.""This transition is essentially laying a road map to a future which is far more scalable far more energy efficient and a lot more usable to the normal person"" said Joseph Ayoub an analyst at Citi who has studied the Merge. ""It's laying the groundwork for adoption.""But the risks are profound. Even by crypto standards the process is almost ludicrously complicated.For months insiders have engaged in frantic jargon-heavy discussions of developments such as the Goerli Testnet Merge and the Beacon Chain's Bellatrix upgrade crucial software changes leading up to the main event. A botched Merge would imperil the thousands of crypto applications that operate using ethereum which collectively handle more than $50 billion in user funds.""It's flying the jet and changing the engine in the sky"" said Chandler Guo a crypto industry veteran who leads a group opposing the Merge. ""It's very difficult. It's very dangerous.""Ethereum is a blockchain a publicly viewable ledger on which exchanges of digital coins are recorded. Transactions on the chain are conducted in Ether.The platform was started in 2013 by a teenage programmer Vitalik Buterin who is now regarded as one of the industry's elder statesmen. Buterin wanted to create a crypto system that was more flexible than bitcoin and could instantly execute financial contracts and other complex forms of exchange.Ethereum's design allows it to support a range of financial engineering. Programmers can build applications using the software to perform more complicated tasks than simple money transfers. Thousands of businesses and projects in the experimental world of decentralized finance now use the platform to offer lending borrowing and other sophisticated investment options. Many non-fungible tokens - the unique digital collectibles known as NFTs - are built on ethereum.At its core the Merge is a change to ethereum's verification system. When someone sends money in a traditional transaction a bank serves as the middleman verifying that one person has sufficient funds to pay someone else.Crypto operates without that middleman. In this alternate financial system transactions are verified by a scattered network of computers. Anyone can plug a machine into the network by running software that solves complex puzzles an energy-guzzling process for confirming transactions. Essentially the computers are racing one another: When the puzzle is solved the winning participants are rewarded with new coins in the digital currency they are verifying.This verification process is widely known as crypto mining and has the technical name ""proof of work."" By some estimates the amount of energy consumed each year in mining is comparable to the annual emissions of entire countries.The Merge is set to shift ethereum to an alternate framework called ""proof of stake"" which requires less energy. In a proof-of-stake system computers don't burn energy racing to verify transactions. Instead crypto investors deposit a certain number of digital coins in a shared pool which enters them into a lottery. Each time an exchange happens a participant is selected from the lottery to verify the transaction and win the rewards.The shift is expected to cut ethereum's energy use by more than 99% which crypto boosters hope will make the technology more popular.""The difference in hardware and energy consumption is so significant"" said Preston Van Loon a developer working on the Merge. ""When NFTs were blowing up people were saying 'I'd love to have an NFT but it feels like I'm burning a forest down.' ""Switching to proof of stake could also help solve another of ethereum's biggest problems: the substantial fees required to use the network. Ethereum can handle only a certain amount of activity at a time so when there's demand for the platform the price of using it goes up. Anyone sending ether must pay a ""gas fee"" - a transaction charge that at times has risen as high as $200.The Merge won't eliminate that problem immediately but developers say it will lay critical groundwork for future upgrades designed to minimize fees.But a change on this scale could also make ethereum vulnerable to hacks or other disruptions some crypto experts say. ""Any time you're making changes to a complex system there must necessarily arise unintended consequences"" said Christopher Calicott a crypto venture investor.Much of the criticism is fueled at least partly by self-interest. Many of the Merge's most vocal opponents are businesses that have built expensive data centers to mine ether in the proof-of-work system.The Merge's origins date to the time of ethereum's creation. Buterin raised the possibility of switching to proof of stake in 2014 but at that point the system was untested. The most successful cryptocurrency was bitcoin which uses proof of work.Since then many newer cryptocurrencies have used proof of stake successfully. Ethereum programmers have been working in earnest on the switch for at least four years. The work is complex and progress has been slow. Engineers had to construct a new blockchain and run tests to check for security holes or other technological bugs that might disrupt the transition.A nonprofit called the Ethereum Foundation helps supervise the platform. But in reality ethereum is run by a loose group of engineers across the world; no top-down authority orchestrated the Merge. Periodically programmers get together on publicly streamed video calls to debate technical aspects of the shift.At one point the shift to proof of stake was supposed to happen as early as 2016. As the Merge came together this year crypto enthusiasts expected a June launch date. Then the Merge was pushed back to August. Now it's set for next month.In the crypto world the delays became a kind of joke. Early on engineers installed what's known as a ""difficulty bomb"" in ethereum's code. It was designed to keep them honest: After a set amount of time the bomb was to go off causing disruptions in the ethereum network unless it was switched to proof of stake. But every time the bomb was supposed to go off the engineers created a new bit of code to defuse it somewhat defeating the point.""We're not doing this lightly"" said Danny Ryan an Ethereum Foundation researcher who has worked on the platform since 2017. ""There's been countless amount of engineering and testing and academic vetting.""In December 2020 ethereum programmers took a big step toward the Merge by releasing a crypto platform called the Beacon Chain a proof-of-stake system designed to provide the foundation for an upgraded ethereum. After two years of testing the Beacon Chain is finally set to integrate with ethereum in mid-September - the merge that gives the process its name.As the Merge draws nearer companies and entrepreneurs with a financial stake in ethereum mining are growing increasingly concerned. Crypto mining has become a multibillion-dollar business dominated by publicly traded companies.In a recent corporate report Hive Blockchain a crypto mining firm that draws revenue from both bitcoin and ethereum said a switch to proof of stake ""may render our mining business less competitive or less profitable."" Hive did not respond to requests for comment.Some ethereum miners are fighting back. Guo who used to run an ethereum mining operation in China has mobilized a group of engineers who are working on an alternate currency to rival the upgraded Ether.Despite the pushback the Merge appears close to completion. A final test known as the Goerli merge was finished successfully this month.Ryan said he planned to gather in person with some colleagues to mark the actual Merge the culmination of five years of his professional life.Planning the celebration is complicated. While developers have estimated a Sept. 15 date the Merge's precise timing is uncertain and subject to complex technical factors. Any glitch could cause another delay.""This might happen at 4 in the morning. It might happen at 2 in the afternoon"" Ryan said. ""But I'll definitely be awake.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS9lbmVyZ3kvb2lsLWdhcy9wZXRyb25ldC10by1pbnZlc3QtcnMtNDAwMDAtY3JvcmUtaW4tNS15cnMvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTM5Nzk4NDkuY21z0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL2luZHVzdHJ5L2VuZXJneS9vaWwtZ2FzL3BldHJvbmV0LXRvLWludmVzdC1ycy00MDAwMC1jcm9yZS1pbi01LXlycy9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTM5Nzk4NDkuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Petronet to invest Rs 40000 crore in 5 yrs,"Find this comment offensive?

This change is in conjunction with the inaugural sailing of the cruise line‚Äôs newest vessel Norwegian Prima which is already serving Coca-Cola beverages.

New Partnership Announced

With Norwegian Prima already serving Coca-Cola products onboard Norwegian Cruise Line president and CEO Harry Sommer officially announced the new partnership with a toast with the iconic Coca-Cola Polar Bear at the ship‚Äôs three-story glass-walled Penrose Atrium.

‚ÄúWith the historic debut of Norwegian Prima Norwegian Cruise Line continues to push boundaries across every element of the guest experience so it‚Äôs perfectly fitting that we are unveiling and bringing on board a fresh new beverage partnership with Coca-Cola during the christening of Norwegian Prima‚Äù Sommer said.

‚ÄúAs a company rooted in history Norwegian Cruise Line is honored to align with a fellow beloved brand Coca-Cola and we look forward to leveraging this relationship to continue to enhance our guest experience.‚Äù

Cruise lines often offer exclusive partnerships with beverage companies with carefully negotiated contracts. These contracts may include better pricing and incentives to be an exclusive beverage partner than if multiple brands were offered on a single ship.

Similar exclusive partnerships are common at theme parks hotel chains and sports stadiums. Other cruise lines currently offering Coca-Cola products include Disney Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean International.

Where to Find Coca-Cola Products

The new Norwegian Prima is the first vessel in Norwegian‚Äôs 18-ship fleet to carry Coca-Cola as its official soft drink. The remaining NCL ships will all be fully switched over to Coca-Cola products by December 2022.

Guests onboard different vessels have already reported the expanding availability of Coca-Cola drinks including on Norwegian Breakaway Norwegian Epic and Norwegian Joy.

Additional ships will begin offering Coca-Cola beverages as bars and lounges can be adequately supplied but there has been no calendar announced of which ships will have which drinks when. For the next few weeks it is possible that guests on different ships may be enjoying different brands of soft drinks.

It can be a challenge to make the switch even on a single ship since each vessel has many different bars lounges and restaurants that all need to be equipped with adequate supplies and new branding to promote the new partnership.

TIMESOFINDIA.COM Updated: Sep 3 2022 23:29 IST IST

The colas developed marketing as a discipline and perhaps it‚Äôs this that Reliance wants to tap into. With a new generation of leaders from the business family soon to take over perhaps they feel that company could use some sprinkling of cola marketing spirit

Mukesh Ambani ‚Äôs decision to buy the Campa-Cola brand for a rumoured Rs 22 crore and relaunch it this year has been greeted as a triumph of nostalgia marketing. It gives Reliance ‚Äôs fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) portfolio a brand with strong recognition if mostly among a slightly ageing demographic. And it‚Äôs got considerable media publicity possibly because many journalists and editors are in that demographic.

Campa‚Äôs nostalgia factor has been promoted by films like Ritesh Batra‚Äôs romance Photograph (2019) where Miloni one of the leads remembers her grandfather buying her a Campa-Cola every day. But after he died and the Campa factory shut down she never touched another cola and finding her a bottle is a quest for Rafi the other protagonist.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoaXNpc21vbmV5LmNvLnVrL21vbmV5L21hcmtldHMvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMTE3NjE1NS9Db2NhLUNvbGEtYm9zcy1oYW5kZWQtMjUway1jb3N0LWxpdmluZy1wZXJrLmh0bWzSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGlzaXNtb25leS5jby51ay9tb25leS9tYXJrZXRzL2FydGljbGUtMTExNzYxNTUvYW1wL0NvY2EtQ29sYS1ib3NzLWhhbmRlZC0yNTBrLWNvc3QtbGl2aW5nLXBlcmsuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coca-Cola boss handed ¬£250k 'cost of living' perk,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.thisismoney.co.uk', port=443): Read timed out.

Q1: Track Evolution and Shock Eliminations

A warm sunny day in Zandvoort sets the scene for Qualifying as the likes of Haas F1 Team Williams Racing and Alfa Romeo Racing take to the track to put in some early laps.

Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team made an early impression coming out on top of the timesheets before the frontrunning teams made their appearances with Lance Stroll in first and Sebastian Vettel in second. They were followed by Guanyu Zhou both Haas cars Valtteri Bottas Alexander Albon Pierre Gasly and Nicholas Latifi ‚Äì rounding out the group of early runners. Yuki Tsunoda saw his first time get deleted.

Verstappen made his first attempt and quickly shot to the top of the board followed by the Ferraris of Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc. Sergio Perez and Daniel Ricciardo sit in fifth and sixth with ten minutes to go. Aston Martin and Haas both remain in the top ten as well as Zhou.

Lando Norris completed his first lap and rose to third place splitting the Ferraris. Norris was noted for an unsafe release in the session‚Äôs first minutes cutting off Tsunoda as he left the pits. Mercedes AMG-Petronas F1 Team took second and third with their first laps and the late-joining BWT Alpine F1 Team put in their first times soon after with Fernando Alonso making a quick run for fourth. Alonso‚Äôs team-mate Esteban Ocon cracked the top ten with his first attempt as well.

With four minutes to go nearly all the drivers are in their garages preparing for their final laps and the at-risk drivers are Vettel Ricciardo Albon Mick Schumacher and Latifi. Albon has the track essentially all to himself as he makes another attempt and lifts himself out of the elimination zone for seventh place. Both Haas drivers were taking their flying laps soon after with Kevin Magnussen reaching twelfth and Schumacher taking eighth.

With less than a minute to go both McLarens are in danger as well as Valtteri Bottas. Norris did however escape elimination by a huge margin setting a time for third after the checkered flag was flown. Tsunoda made a shock lap for second right after both of these impressive laps proving the importance of track evolution at this particular circuit. Being last out on track gives a considerable advantage with more running culminating into a grippier line.

Ultimately Bottas was eliminated from sixteenth place just one tenth behind team-mate Zhou who made it through to the next round. Magnussen finished a disappointing seventeenth unable to match Schumacher‚Äôs promising pace. Ricciardo was unable to scrape by in those final seconds ending up knocked out in eighteenth place. Vettel found himself on the back row after running into some problems on his last lap finishing in nineteenth alongside Latifi.

Eliminated: Bottas Magnussen Ricciardo Vettel Latifi

Q2: Stroll Schumacher advance as Alpines fall short

Albon was first and only car on the track when a red flag was flown for a flare that was tossed onto the track by a fan‚Äì this would happen again later in qualifying causing a hindrance for those on flying laps. The flag continued to get some pigeons off of the side of the track and then qualifying was underway once again.

The Red Bulls were out on track first alongside Albon as Verstappen went one followed by Perez in second fourth tenths behind. Hamilton split the Red Bulls with his first lap as Russell took fourth. Norris grabbed fifth place soon after while the rest of the grid put in their first attempts.

The Ferraris were only able to reach sixth and seventh with their initial runs unable to crack the times of Norris or Russell. Stroll put in a great time to go fourth his Aston Martin showing great potential in Zandvoort. Alonso joined the top ten with an eighth place run while Ocon remained down in the drop zone as the teams returned to the pits.

With just under six minutes to go Gasly Ocon Zhou Tsunoda and Schumacher were at risk of elimination. Albon was once again first out and remained in tenth after what would be his final attempt. Verstappen didn‚Äôt join the mass of cars going out for their final lap showing confidence in the solid time he had already set.

Sainz would take first and Russell second demoting Verstappen down to third. Albon was sent back to the drop zone knocked out by Zhou who took tenth with his final lap. Schumacher escaped elimination setting a time for eighth place with Ocon setting a time for tenth soon after to demote his team-mate into the elimination zone. Tsunoda made a late run for tenth as Gasly and Alonso were unable to improve. Alonso complained of traffic in his last lap with Perez going slowly around turn eight.

It was a surprising elimination for Alpine who were immensely competitive just last week in Spa. This left room for the likes of Schumacher and Stroll to make an unlikely appearance in Q3 as well as Tsunoda.

Eliminated: Gasly Ocon Alonso Zhou Albon

Q3: Verstappen Leclerc vie for pole as Perez crash ends session

Verstappen and Perez set the pace with the first times of the final qualifying session with Verstappen in first and Perez behind. There is already more potential to be found for Verstappen who took a little too much curb on the banked turn three. Norris slotted into third soon after.

Leclerc‚Äôs first attempt saw him take provisional pole with over six minutes to go as the top ten all made their initial laps. Hamilton split the Red Bulls to take third as Sainz later took fourth on his first go. Russell sat in sixth Norris seventh followed by Tsunoda and Schumacher. Stroll would not take to the track in what would have been his first Q3 appearance since Miami due to a technical issue.

Just one tenth apart after their first laps it appeared that the fight was on between Verstappen and Leclerc for the top spot. The margins were narrow across the board and it would be a tight battle to the checkered flag for all the drivers.

First to take his final lap Leclerc was purple in the first sector but couldn‚Äôt improve in the second. A third purple sector however allowed Leclerc to improve upon his leading time. Verstappen was on a flyer just behind green in the first sector and purple in the second‚Äì and finally crossed the line to take pole. Verstappen set a time of 1:10.342 only a touch ahead of Leclerc‚Äôs 1:10.363.

Sainz set a time for third as the fans applauded Verstappen‚Äôs pole effort but the attention was quickly drawn to Perez who had spun on the final turn and brought out a yellow flag. Both Mercedes drivers behind were unable to finish their laps among others. The top ten was set after the dramatic end to the session.

Verstappen took his second consecutive pole at his home event joined by Leclerc on the front row. Sainz and Hamilton follow in third and fourth. Perez solidified his position in fifth after his crash and will line up alongside Russell in Sixth. Norris and Schumacher make up the next row in seventh and eighth with Tsunoda and Stroll rounding out the top ten.

""Can you believe they pay us to do this?"" he said.

It seemed like money well spent after the Gators delivered their biggest season-opening victory in more than 50 years.

Anthony Richardson ran for three scores in his second career start including a 2-yard scamper with 1:25 remaining and Florida upset seventh-ranked Utah 29-26 on Saturday night to get the Napier era off to a rousing start.

Richardson was the best player on the field most of the night. He really showed up down the stretch although fifth-year linebacker Amari Burney was the one who sealed the victory for the rebuilding Gators. Burney intercepted Cam Rising's second-down pass into the end zone with 17 seconds remaining.

""Someone had to make a play"" Burney said. ""It happened to be me.""

That set off a wild celebration for many of the 90799 in attendance ‚Äî the 10th most at home in school history. Richardson took a knee from there and the Gators rushed the field to revel in their 33rd consecutive victory in home season openers. That's the longest current streak in the nation.

‚ÄúThis group's got a lot of fight in them"" said Napier who replaced fired coach Dan Mullen in November. ""They've got a little bit different edge to them.""

Richardson ran 11 times for 106 yards and was never stopped for a loss. He completed 17 of 24 passes for 168 yards and played turnover-free football.

""He's going to get his (NFL payday)"" Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said. ""He's 6-4 230 and runs like a 4.3. He's a terrific player.""

Richardson had an electrifying 2-point conversion early in the fourth quarter that put the Gators up 22-19. He juked former Florida teammate Mohamoud Diabate with a pump fake and then sprinted right by fellow Utah linebacker Lander Barton before throwing a strike to Ja'Quavion Fraziers in the back of the end zone.

Utah answered and briefly took the lead but Richardson responded. He moved the chains with a third-down throw and again with a fourth-down run both of which set up his game winner.

""Just trying to make something happen. Glad it worked"" Richardson said.

Rising moved the Utes in position to steal one on the road for a team that entered the season with its highest preseason ranking in school history. But Rising's last pass was his most important ‚Äî or costly ‚Äî of the night.

""It wasn't Cam's best throw"" Whittingham said. ""I'm sure he'd like that back but he played great.""

Rising completed 22 of 32 passes for 216 yards with a touchdown and the turnover. He also ran for 91 more.

Tavion Thomas had 115 yards rushing and a score for Utah which caught a break when it rained about two hours before kickoff and erased whatever advantage Florida had with sweltering summer heat and humidity.",,,,,,
CL,Colgate-Palmolive,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvc2VwLzA0L3VuaXZlcnNpdHktb2YtYXJrYW5zYXMtYmVnaW5zLWZpbmFsLXBoYXNlLW9mL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,University of Arkansas begins final phase of Mullins Library renovation | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"



FAYETTEVILLE -- Between the last major renovation of the David W. Mullins Library in 1997 and the current two-phase remodeling project enrollment at the University of Arkansas Fayetteville has roughly doubled -- to approximately 30000 students -- so ""we're trying to serve double the students but in the same building"" said Kelsey Lovewell Lippard director of public relations for University Libraries.

The initial phase of renovations focused on the third and fourth levels of Mullins Library the main research library for the university and cost approximately $25 million. The second -- and final -- phase of a project that began in 2018 focuses on modernizing the first and second levels in a similar manner to the renovations of levels three and four which were completed in August 2021.

Senior Shannon Morneault believes the library's third and fourth levels were improved significantly by the first phase of the renovation and she thinks the first two levels will benefit similarly from phase two.

The renovated third and fourth levels are ""a lot better"" than their erstwhile editions which were ""not conducive to studying"" said the international business major. ""It was so open and bare that I wouldn't really use it; I'd go somewhere else -- like the law library -- because I could focus better.""

The renovated levels however ""are so much nicer that I spend a lot of time here because I can concentrate really well"" she said. ""The setting the colors the layout [are all better] and there are lots of options for seating"" -- alone with a partner with a big or small group on the quieter third floor or the louder fourth level -- ""so you can pick what fits you.""

""As a freshman and sophomore I didn't do as much work in between classes because I felt like I didn't really have anywhere to go but now I just come here"" she said. ""I get more done -- I was doing some work for my internship with Colgate-Palmolive [Company today] -- so it's less I have to do at night.""

As word has spread around campus about the improvements to the library's third and fourth levels -- and as the covid-19 pandemic has receded -- student visits have increased said Jason Battles dean of University Libraries. ""We're seeing really high usage this term almost double what we did in the spring semester.""

""I was in here every day last week"" during the first week of classes and ""this library will be a home base for me"" junior Jordyn Linnstaedter said Tuesday as she did work for her accounting class on the library's fourth floor. ""It's very important"" to have a space like this on campus.

Linnstaedter particularly appreciates the surplus of charging stations and ""comfortable seats"" on the library's third and fourth levels both of which will be part of the renovations on the first and second levels said the business major. ""It helps my brain switch into a productive setting.""

Study rooms on the remodeled levels have proved particularly popular with students Battles said. ""We could build 100 more and they'd all still be filled.""

The second/final phase of the library remodeling project has a budget of $35.5-$41.5 million and is scheduled for completion by June 2024 Lovewell said. Named for David Wiley Mullins then the university's president the library was built in 1968 to replace Vol Walker Hall as the university's main library and it's one of five librariries on campus but ""by far the largest.""

While the project's second/final phase won't start in earnest until the conclusion of this fall semester library patrons will notice collections and furnishings shift during this semester in preparation Lovewell said. For example books materials and furniture are currently being moved out of levels one and two which will remain open through December's final exams as ""we felt it was very important to be open through finals.""

While some have worried about books seemingly ""disappearing"" from the library Lovewell assures they are only moving due to the renovations and they will return.

""We love books -- the library will always have books -- and we continue to purchase books"" she said. ""We're just protecting them during the renovations.""

Library users can find collections that have been moved via an online renovation updates page https://libraries.uark.edu/updates/.

The first and second levels will be closed temporarily during the second semester due to asbestos abatement and other construction but the third and fourth levels will remain open during the library's remodeling with access to stairs and elevators near the west and east entrances according to Lovewell. Core library services including the help desk interlibrary loan course reserves and multimedia services will relocate operations to the fourth level during construction and the Special Collections reading room will reopen Sept. 6 in Mullins Library room 329.

This renovation will result in more prominent placement for Special Collections currently ""tucked away in a basement corner room"" Battles said. ""We really want to make that stand out by bringing it to the center of the first floor with -- hopefully -- a staircase leading to it [rather than] buried.""

Special Collections is ""special"" for several reasons including that ""anyone can come here and use it or access it remotely"" said Joshua Youngblood rare books librarian and head of Special Collections instruction and outreach. ""We have scholars come here from all over the world and it's a great service.""

""We have the largest collection of printed materials on Arkansas by Arkansans anywhere in the world and we could do different exhibitions every day for a year without ever touching the end of what we have here"" Youngblood added. ""We also help students learn critical thinking and analysis of primary sources.""

Special Collections will have a dedicated classroom space as part of the final phase of library renovations Battles said. ""That'll be great a dedicated instuctional component.""

There will also be a space dedicated to processing materials the library receives Lovewell said. ""We get thousands of pieces each year and we need to carefully process all of that for archiving.""

Climate control is another critical piece of the final phase of the library's renovation Battles said. ""For preservation purposes humidity is the big [concern because] we want to store these materials so they last.""

Kennedy & Violich Architecture (KVA) from Boston is partnering with Fayetteville's DEMX Architecture on the project with Con-Real the general contractor according to Lovewell. KVA has previously worked on construction and renovation projects at Harvard University's Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America and the Hayden Library at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology while Con-Real served as general contractor on the first phase of the Mullins Library project as well as construction of the University Libraries high-density storage facility known as LINX and located in the Art and Design District off of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.

A cafe on the first floor of Mullins Library is also part of the renovation's final phase Lovewell said. ""Kim and Chris Fowler donated $500000 for the cafe and anonymous donors provided $600000 for the renovation of our Special Collections division and Arkansas Folk and Traditional Arts department.""

""Students are really excited about that cafe -- they've already been asking about getting jobs there -- and it'll be nice for them to have more than a vending machine in the library"" Lovewell said. ""Students can spend hours upon hours here especially during finals.""

Renovations will also create more flexible spaces that can be used for meetings of small or large groups Battles said. Those groups can be members of the campus community but also the community beyond campus in Fayetteville Washington County and Northwest Arkansas.

The renovated second level will also feature virtual reality and augmented reality spaces -- ""those are used in a variety of disciplines -- maker technology and we'd like to have a recording studio"" Battles said. ""The library is here for every student in every program.""

The defense ‚Äî left-fielder Victor Reyes shortstop Javier BaÃÅez and catcher Tucker Barnhart ‚Äî executed a relay to perfection to get a K.C. runner at the plate but on the next play a hard-hit ball got past third baseman Jeimer Candelario and the Royals scored the game-winning run.

""I think it's a tough play"" manager A.J. Hinch said. ""I think it's a makable play. But those are hard plays. This is a tough league and guys hit it hard. You got one chance to field it and get it to first but he just couldn't come up with it.""

The Tigers lost 3-2 in the series finale at Comerica Park.

IN THE BULLPEN:Reliever Alex Lange 'ready to go' for Tigers ... and Team Puerto Rico

WELCOME TO THE SHOW:Josh Lester promoted from Triple-A Toledo

The Tigers (51-83) dropped two of three games to the Royals. Left-handed closer Gregory Soto entered for the eighth inning ‚Äî his first eighth-inning appearance since Aug. 1 ‚Äî and walked Nicky Lopez on seven pitches with one out.

""When you go to the bullpen as early as we had to the way it all mapped out we're just trying to get to the finish line with the lead or tied"" Hinch said. ""Obviously they came up big at the last opportunity.""

MJ Melendez doubled to the left-field corner and Lopez tried to score from first base. The relay throw which ended in Barnhart smothering a one-hopper from BaÃÅez beat Lopez to the plate for the second out.

Melendez advanced to third on the play at the plate.

Royals rookie Bobby Witt Jr. then hammered a third-pitch slider with a 101.7 mph exit velocity. The ball snuck underneath a diving Candelario and rolled into left field. Melendez scored easily putting Kansas City ahead 3-2 while Witt stretched a single into a double.

""We've got to make sure that play is made"" BaÃÅez said.

Tigers rookie center fielder Riley Greene finished 1-for-4 with two strikeouts and extended his hitting streak to 13 games with a single in the third inning. He also completed a leaping catch in the right-center gap in the ninth inning.

Greene is hitting .396 (21-for-53) with two doubles three triples two home runs five walks and 16 strikeouts over his past 13 games.

Second baseman Ryan Kreidler a fellow rookie playing the third MLB game of his career went 0-for-4 with two strikeouts.

""I had to get adjusted when he played third (base) because he's so long"" BaÃÅez said of Kreidler's defense. ""He can get to balls that we can get at the same time. But he's a great athlete too. Like I've said all year they just got to get experience playing time and make adjustments when they make mistakes.""

A rough fourth for Manning

Right-hander Matt Manning took the mound for his seventh start since returning from the injured list in early August. The 24-year-old allowed two runs on five hits and three walks with three strikeouts over four innings.

The fourth inning an 33-pitch effort doomed Manning.

""It was just finding my pitches"" Manning said. ""I would have it here and there then lose it for a little bit. For the most part I think my fastball missed over the plate when it should have been away. I ran into some trouble in the fourth inning.""

During that inning he gave up two singles two walks and one hit-by-pitch. Michael A. Taylor singled to open the fourth then Michael Massey was hit by a slider. A one-out walk to Drew Waters loaded the bases.

Lopez singled on a first-pitch curveball from Manning putting the Royals ahead 1-0. The next batter Melendez drew a nine-pitch walk ‚Äî the plate appearance included five fouls ‚Äî with the bases loaded to increase the margin to 2-0.

The Tigers despite Manning's struggles stuck with their young pitcher against two of the best hitters in Kansas City's lineup. Witt Jr. flied out to right field on a first-pitch slider; Salvador Perez struck out swinging on a down-and-away 94.2 mph four-seam fastball.

""He's got to pitch through this"" Hinch said. ""When you're making decisions when you're trying to develop young pitchers and getting them through the stress that comes with being erratic or spraying the ball it's tough living sometimes. He's got to learn how to do it.""

For Manning's 90 pitches (57 strikes) he threw 43 four-seam fastballs (48%) 20 sliders (22%) 12 changeups (13%) 11 curveballs (12%) and four sinkers (4%). He recorded eight swings and misses ‚Äî four with his fastball ‚Äî and seven called strikes.

His fastball averaged 92.9 mph.

Max pain

Opposing Manning Royals right-hander Max Castillo allowed two runs on five hits and one walk with five strikeouts over 4‚Öî innings. After Kansas City scored two runs in the top of the fourth inning the Tigers countered with two runs in the bottom of the frame.

BaÃÅez lined a changeup in a 2-0 count into left for a leadoff single. Harold Castro like BaÃÅez worked a 2-0 count. Instead of a changeup though Castro received a fastball in the strike zone.

""I'm seeing the ball better and slowing everything down"" BaÃÅez said. ""I'm working in the (batting) cage to focus on seeing the ball and keeping my plan.""

Castro hammered the ball 390 feet and into the right-center seats for a two-run home run his sixth homer of the year to make it 2-2.

Goodbye Pineda

After Sunday's game Hinch announced that veteran right-hander Michael Pineda has been designated for assignment with the team intending to call up a reliever in his place and give his spot in the rotation to a younger pitcher.

Pineda returned from the 15-day injured list on Saturday and allowed five runs on six hits with two walks over four innings. Signed to a one-year $5.5 million contract during the spring Pineda's time with the Tigers featured a 2-7 record and a 5.79 ERA over 46‚Öî innings with 26 strikeouts and eight walks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmthbnNhc2NpdHkuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9tbGIva2Fuc2FzLWNpdHktcm95YWxzL2FydGljbGUyNjUzMjcwODEuaHRtbNIBTmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmthbnNhc2NpdHkuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9tbGIva2Fuc2FzLWNpdHktcm95YWxzL2FydGljbGUyNjUzMjcwODEuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bobby Witt Jr.‚Äôs RBI double lifts KC Royals to series-clinching win at Detroit Tigers,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.kansascity.com', port=443): Read timed out.

There's good reason investors fear the economy could slide further into a recession and drag stocks down with it. Persistent inflation rising interest rates and a stumbling housing market are all worrisome indicators that we might have further to fall before we reach bottom.

That's why finding a safe haven now might make sense and utility stocks may be your best bet. They can be the ballast for a portfolio during troubled times and perform well when the storm clouds finally break. There's good reason utilities have long been seen as the ultimate widows-and-orphans stocks.

Pulling your money out of the market is not really a viable option if you want to build generational wealth because if you miss the rebound your long-term returns will be severely harmed. Over the 20-year period between 2001 and 2021 the S&P 500 returned 9.5% annually on average but if you had missed out on just the market's 10 best days your returns would have been cut to 5.3%.

That's why buying now makes sense. The following three utility stocks are ones you'll be happy you own a decade into the future.

American States Water

American States Water (AWR 1.87%) is a utility that's seen it all. Founded in 1929 it's been through the Great Depression two world wars numerous market crashes and recessions and a host of global geopolitical events that have turned the world upside down.

And through it all it has steadfastly paid a dividend to its investors -- 86 straight years in all -- but more importantly has raised the payout each and every year for 68 consecutive years (it just raised it again by 8.9%). While that puts American States Water in that rarified group of stocks called Dividend Kings it's all the more notable because no other stock on the market has as long a track record of raising its dividend than this water utility.

American States Water is primarily tasked with providing clean water and electricity to Southern California which represents about 66% of its revenue but it also has long-term contracts with the U.S. government to provide water to 11 military bases which account for another quarter of total revenue. The rest it gets from generating electricity.

Shares of the utility are down 20% year-to-date as it has missed analyst earnings estimates several times over the past few quarters but that is largely due to California utility regulators failing to approve its rate requests for 2022. That means American States Water is still operating under 2021 rates so if and when the increases do go through they should be retroactive to January.

The water utility is a solid dependable business that has a long history of returning value to shareholders a track record that will undoubtedly continue to 2032 and beyond.

Consolidated Edison

On the other side of the country is Consolidated Edison (ED 0.56%) commonly known as ConEd which provides electricity natural gas and steam to customers in New York state. It has also heavily invested in the renewable energy market and maintains it supports ""a reliable transition from fossil fuels to renewables to reduce carbon emissions"" while also maximizing returns for investors. It operates a network of utility-scale wind and solar energy projects across 20 states that can generate three gigawatts of power.

Yet even though ConEd's stock is up 15% in 2022 management believes that the market is undervaluing its business because of the differences inherent in the fossil fuel and clean energy businesses. It is conducting a strategic review of its clean energy assets though it hasn't said whether a full sale spinoff or asset sale is the desired outcome. Analysts believe the utility will sell the unit as a whole to reduce its equity needs.

ConEd is another dependable dividend-paying stock to own for the long haul that has hiked its payout for 46 consecutive years making it a Dividend Aristocrat but one within reach of soon becoming a Dividend King.

Brookfield Infrastructure Partners

Yes Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP 1.02%) owns traditional utility operations around the globe with electricity transmission and distribution lines in Australia and Brazil and natural gas pipelines in North America South America and India. Yet it also owns and operates a number of ""utility-like"" infrastructure assets too including railroads toll roads ports and liquefied natural gas (LNG) export operations; oil and natural gas midstream assets; and data centers cell towers fiber-optic cables and data transmission assets.

Now Brookfield is getting into computer chips too as it just signed an agreement with semiconductor giant Intel (INTC 0.30%) to jointly fund the chipmaker's new fabrication facility it's building in Arizona. Let's just say Brookfield Infrastructure is a unique play on the utility space.

What's especially distinctive about this infrastructure stock is that it's not especially beholden to any one asset and is willing to sell any one of them off and either reinvest in existing operations or buy a new one. It has called that its ""buy enhance sell repeat"" strategy. Wash. Rinse. Repeat.

While Brookfield doesn't have the same track record as American States or ConEd in dividend payments it has raised its payout every year for 10 years. In another 10 years' time investors will appreciate both its capital investments and its dividend.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4dHJhLmVjL25vdGljaWEvanVkaWNpYWwvcmlvcy1jdW1wbGVhbm9zLWxlLWRpZXJvbi01LXRpcm9zLTcyNDM5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Los R√≠os: En su cumplea√±os le dieron 5 tiros,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL2Z1dGJvbC5yYWRpb2Zvcm11bGEuY29tLm14L2N1cmlvc2lkYWRlcy8yMDIyLzkvMy9jdWFsLWVyYS1sYS1leHRyYW5hLXBydWViYS1xdWUtdGhvbWFzLWVkaXNvbi1oYWNpYS1xdWllbi1sZS1wZWRpYS10cmFiYWpvLTYyNTA5Lmh0bWzSAZwBaHR0cHM6Ly9mdXRib2wucmFkaW9mb3JtdWxhLmNvbS5teC9jdXJpb3NpZGFkZXMvMjAyMi85LzMvY3VhbC1lcmEtbGEtZXh0cmFuYS1wcnVlYmEtcXVlLXRob21hcy1lZGlzb24taGFjaWEtcXVpZW4tbGUtcGVkaWEtdHJhYmFqby02MjUwOS5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,¬øCu√°l era la extra√±a prueba que Thomas Edison hac√≠a a quien le ped√≠a trabajo?,"Si alguna vez has pedido trabajo es muy probable que sepas que algunos reclutadores sorprenden con preguntas muy random o raras que parecen no estar relacionadas con la vacante. Sin embargo eso te parecer√° poca cosa cuando te digamos qu√© extra√±a prueba hac√≠a Thomas Edison a quienes le solicitaban empleo.

Resulta que al igual que los encargados de Recursos Humanos Edison sab√≠a que la mayor√≠a de los candidatos a un puesto ten√≠an el mismo nivel de conocimiento por lo que hac√≠a un test sencillo para ver m√°s all√° de lo aprendido en las escuela.

Con el fin de buscar c√≥mo pensaban y analizaban cada situaci√≥n y as√≠ darse una idea de la creatividad e inteligencia de sus futuros empleados Thomas Edison los invitaba a tomar un plato de sopa con √©l.

¬øQu√© es la prueba de la sopa de Edison?

El fin de esta reuni√≥n era ver si los solicitantes a√±ad√≠an sal y pimienta antes de probar lo que estaba en su plato o si esperaban hasta haberlo probado para luego sazonar.

Quienes sin probarla sazonaban su sopa eran descartados de inmediato por el inventor pues no quer√≠a a su lado gente que se basara en presunciones sino personas que tuvieran ganas de probar cosas nuevas y buscar soluciones para ellas.

Es as√≠ que quienes al estar frente al plato preguntaban si ten√≠an alg√∫n condimento extra para darle un mejor sabor eran mucho mejor recibidos por el inventor pues ah√≠ notaba que la creatividad e innovaci√≥n corr√≠a por su sangre.

Aunado a esa prueba Thomas Edison tambi√©n preguntaba cosas inesperadas a los candidatos.

Ello con el objetivo de saber el nivel de cultura general que ten√≠an quienes formar√≠an parte de su equipo de trabajo.

As√≠ que ya sabes la pr√≥xima vez que tengas una entrevista de empleo pon mucha atenci√≥n para evitar solo hablar de tus estudios.

Da tiempo para ejemplificar c√≥mo es que gracias a tu inteligencia has podido resolver alguna situaci√≥n pr√°ctica relacionada con la vacante y ten la mente abierta para responder cualquier cosa.

Recuerda que no hay respuestas err√≥neas; sin embargo siempre debes cuidar tus gestos y forma de actuar frente al empleador que podr√≠a ser tan peculiar como Thomas Edison.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vc3RyaWtlcnMuZnV0Ym9sL3BlcnUvY3JhY2tzL0VkaXNvbi1GbG9yZXMtZXMtc2VuYWxhZG8tZW4tQXRsYXMtcG9yLWJham8tcmVuZGltaWVudG8tMjAyMjA5MDQtMDAwMi5odG1s0gFuaHR0cHM6Ly9zdHJpa2Vycy5mdXRib2wvcGVydS9jcmFja3MvRWRpc29uLUZsb3Jlcy1lcy1zZW5hbGFkby1lbi1BdGxhcy1wb3ItYmFqby1yZW5kaW1pZW50by0yMDIyMDkwNC0wMDAyLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Edison Flores es se√±alado en Atlas por bajo rendimiento,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://strikers.futbol/peru/cracks/Edison-Flores-es-senalado-en-Atlas-por-bajo-rendimiento-20220904-0002.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vc3RyaWtlcnMuZnV0Ym9sL3BlcnUvY3JhY2tzL0VkaXNvbi1GbG9yZXMtZXMtc2VuYWxhZG8tZW4tQXRsYXMtcG9yLWJham8tcmVuZGltaWVudG8tMjAyMjA5MDQtMDAwMi5odG1s0gFuaHR0cHM6Ly9zdHJpa2Vycy5mdXRib2wvcGVydS9jcmFja3MvRWRpc29uLUZsb3Jlcy1lcy1zZW5hbGFkby1lbi1BdGxhcy1wb3ItYmFqby1yZW5kaW1pZW50by0yMDIyMDkwNC0wMDAyLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

The iron-flow battery storage system built by ESS Tech is located in the white shipping container in the foreground. Read more

In a repurposed mushroom barn in Chester County Sycamore International Inc. recycles electronic equipment including refurbishing 30000 old laptops a month for resale. Steven Figgatt Sycamore‚Äôs chief executive says his West Grove company is all about the circular economy.

In keeping with its sustainable mission Sycamore earlier this year installed a rooftop solar system to convert its operations to renewable energy. But Figgatt 36 only declared his company‚Äôs freedom from the electric grid in late August when he commissioned a new innovative battery storage system that assures his business is supplied by solar power even when the sun isn‚Äôt shining.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre calling it our Energy Independence Day‚Äù he said.

Figgatt went out on a limb with his choice of energy-storage technology selecting a novel system called an iron-flow battery the first of its kind on the East Coast.

Iron-flow batteries are among many promising grid-scale energy storage technologies that are vying for acceptance in a market where renewable energy is expanding quickly to replace greenhouse-gas emitting power sources.

As renewable generation grows in importance the market for energy-storage systems is expected to play a key role. Wind and solar systems produce power intermittently depending upon the weather and grid operators say they will need more storage systems as renewable energy takes a bigger share of the power-generation market.

Makers of battery storage devices anticipate a boost from the Inflation Reduction Act which President Joe Biden signed into law Aug. 16. The law contains tax incentives for buyers of energy storage devices.

Longer life span. No explosions.

An iron-flow battery is significantly different from a lithium-ion battery the device commonly used in electric vehicles mobile devices and some commercial applications.

The iron-flow battery‚Äôs big selling point is that its electrolyte the material that conducts an electrical charge is not a metal mined in an unfriendly country. Instead the electrolyte is made of ferrous chloride which is basically iron salt and water all widely available. Unlike lithium it‚Äôs nontoxic and doesn‚Äôt overheat and explode.

Sycamore‚Äôs long-duration battery can discharge its power over 12 hours about three times longer than a lithium battery or roughly corresponding to the time when the sun isn‚Äôt shining. It can hold about 400 kilowatt hours of power enough to supply about 28 homes for 12 hours.

The iron-flow battery is also warrantied to withstand 25 years of charging and discharging cycles without deteriorating. It promises to be operating long after the Energizer Bunny wheezes to the sidelines.

‚ÄúIt was exciting trying something new‚Äù Figgatt said. ‚ÄúI mean I love that there‚Äôs no toxic chemicals there‚Äôs no risk of fire hazards that you have with lithium-ion batteries. And also you can cycle it all the time unlike lithium-ion batteries that have a finite number of cycles before they need to be replaced. This is kind of limitless so we‚Äôre going to run off it all the time.‚Äù

The downside of flow batteries is that they are big heavy and stationary ‚Äî Sycamore‚Äôs battery is housed in a 40-foot shipping container that weighed nearly 20 tons before 19000 liters of electrolyte are added. They‚Äôre not designed for automobiles or mobile devices but for large-scale support of the power grid.

A second battery on order

Most of the nations‚Äô long-duration energy storage is located in pumped-storage hydropower plants such as Constellation Energy‚Äôs Muddy Run facility in Lancaster County where water is pumped into a reservoir at a higher elevation and then released to generate power when needed.

Flow batteries store energy in tanks of electrolytes which pass through an electrochemical membrane to extract electrons during the charging and discharging process.

The iron-flow device Sycamore acquired is called an Energy Warehouse manufactured by ESS Tech Inc. of Wilsonville Ore. The company has been developing a commercial iron-flow battery for more than a decade and last year went public in a merger with a special purpose acquisition company becoming the first publicly listed manufacturer of long-duration batteries. Like many tech start-ups its stock has fared poorly this year and is down 60% since its launch last October.

But its fortunes may improve. It has a backlog of orders including one for another unit for Sycamore International whose business is picking up more institutional clients who want to dispose of old electronic devices and permanently erase any traces of data in Sycamore‚Äôs secure process. Sycamore plans to break ground this fall to expand into a new building in West Grove also equipped with its own solar system.

ESS has installed several batteries for San Diego Gas & Electric in Cameron Corners Calif. a town at risk of getting cut off from the grid from wild fires. It‚Äôs also working with Portland General Electric a utility company to build a half-acre Energy Center with about eight times the storage capacity as West Grove unit. Last month it announced an agreement to ship 70 Battery Warehouses to Australia and to open an assembly plant in that country by 2024.

But the biggest news in the last month was the Inflation Reduction Act which contains tax incentives for buyers of energy storage devices that are boosted by 10% for domestically produced devices such as the ESS Energy Warehouse. The IRA also provides credits to buyers of standalone battery storage units while previous tax incentives applied only to energy storage directly associated with renewable generation.

‚ÄúIt helps level the playing field for us versus our competitors‚Äù Eric Dresselhuys the chief executive of ESS said in an interview. ESS‚Äôs competitors are usually Chinese lithium battery makers who Dresselhuys says receive state support. While the IRA tax credits are available for all batteries he said ‚Äúit‚Äôs worth more if you buy U.S. made products.‚Äù

‚ÄòThe battery is basically an insurance product‚Äô

The seeds for Sycamore International‚Äôs move into solar were planted more than five years ago at Millersville University when Figgatt attended the launch of a solar system at the university‚Äôs new Lombardo Welcome Center. There Figgatt met Dave Santoleri president of TerraSol Energies Inc. a Chadds Ford firm that designed and installed the 175-kilowatt Millersville system. Figgatt enlisted Terrasol to explore doing a solar installation at its West Grove plant.

‚ÄúI knew flow batteries were a cool idea‚Äù Santoleri said. ‚ÄúI did a search and found five companies that made them. Three of them were out of business.‚Äù He did find that ESS was still in business and the only manufacturer located in the U.S. He and Figgatt visited the company in Oregon and were sold.

‚ÄúWe did our due diligence‚Äù Figgatt said. ‚ÄúWe do know it‚Äôs a newer technology so we went through a whole vetting process with ESS.‚Äù

The battery system basically doubled the cost of Sycamore‚Äôs solar installation ‚Äî the battery itself is in the neighborhood of $200000 though Figgatt is vague about his total investment in the system. Figgatt figures the whole system will pay for itself in six to nine years depending upon what happens with market energy prices. Meanwhile Sycamore‚Äôs energy costs are fixed.

For Figgatt the battery backup provides more than just savings off his Peco bill. When the second battery system is installed Sycamore International will be able to sell some of its surplus power back to the regional grid operator to help keep power levels in the area consistent an important background role known as frequency regulation.

It will spare his business from long storm-related outages. And the voltage produced from his solar system is also finely tuned which is critically important to Sycamore‚Äôs operations where his 70 employees may be erasing the delicate hard drives of as many as 600 laptops simultaneously as they undergo refurbishment.

‚ÄúWhen the power goes out during some of these big weather events it‚Äôs devastating‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe grid is not as reliable out here. So the battery is basically an insurance product. From my perspective it pays for itself in like three days of power outages.‚Äù

The importance of energy storage to a decarbonized energy future is so significant that U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer M. Granholm visited ESS‚Äôs plant in Oregon last month part of a tour touting the climate benefits of the IRA.

In West Grove Sycamore International‚Äôs ribbon-cutting of its battery storage system on Aug. 25 also drew praise from U.S. Rep. Chrissy Houlahan a Democrat who represents Chester and Berks Counties. ‚ÄúThis project represents the kind of forward-thinking solution we need to build a decarbonized resilient energy system‚Äù she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS9odWJibGUtc3BhY2UtdGVsZXNjb3BlLXBob3RvLWdhbGF4eS1zdHJhbmdlLXNoYXBl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hubble Space Telescope captures stunning photo of a galaxy with a strange shape,"The Hubble Space Telescope captured a new photo of a dwarf irregular galaxy called NGC 1156 located 25 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Aries.

Bright red ""blossoms"" of star formation stand out in a new image of an unconventional galaxy.

A new photo from the Hubble Space Telescope captures a dwarf irregular galaxy called NGC 1156. Located 25 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Aries NGC 1156 boasts a unique structure unlike most other galaxies ‚Äî a ""marvel of galactic morphology"" according to a statement from the European Space Agency (ESA) which is a partner on the mission.

""Its thousands of bright stars evoke a spiral galaxy but it lacks the characteristic 'winding' structure"" ESA officials wrote in the statement releasing the new Hubble image on Aug. 22. ""Yet it also radiates a diffuse glow much like an elliptical galaxy and its core of older redder stars .""

Related: The best Hubble Space Telescope images of all time!

The shining red blossoms scattered across the photo represent areas of intense star formation which fuels the galaxy's extreme energy. The ionized hydrogen gas outflows from these young stars gives off a red glow.

Spiral galaxies typically exhibit a central bulge made up of older dimmer stars surrounded by a flat rotating disk of hot young stars. While NGC 1156 does have a densely-packed center with older generations of stars its younger stars are not contained in the telltale spiral arms circling the galaxy. Given it lacks any sort of distinct shape ‚Äî neither a spiral nor an elliptical structure ‚Äî astronomers have classified NGC 1156 as a dwarf irregular galaxy.

However the galaxy is also classified as isolated because no other galaxies are located close enough to influence its odd shape and continuing star formation according to the statement.

While Hubble has previously photographed NGC 1156 the new image was captured as part of a program called Every Known Nearby Galaxy which aims to fill a gap in galactic observations.

""Astronomers noticed that only three quarters of the galaxies within just over 30 million light-years of Earth had been observed by Hubble in sufficient detail to study the makeup of the stars within them"" according to the ESA statement. ""They proposed that in between larger projects Hubble could take snapshots of the remaining quarter ‚Äî including NGC 1156. Gap-filling programs like this one ensure that the best use is made of Hubble's valuable observing time.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbHRpbW9yZXN1bi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8wNC9kbGEtcGlwZXItbW92ZS1jb250aW51ZXMtbmVnbGVjdC1vZi1jZW50cmFsLWJ1c2luZXNzLWRpc3RyaWN0LXJlYWRlci1jb21tZW50YXJ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DLA Piper move continues neglect of central business district | READER COMMENTARY,"The Baltimore Sun reported the news that the DLA Piper law firm is moving to Harbor East after a 20-year escape to the suburbs. However what The Sun did not say is that the firm is jumping over the central business district like so many other recent companies have done including: Constellation Energy Legg Mason (now Franklin Templeton) T. Rowe Price Transamerica Ernst & Young Gordon Feinblatt and Saul Ewing. To say that DLA Piper is moving back ‚Äúdowntown‚Äù ignores the reality that the large business community has abandoned our city in fact and in spirit (‚ÄúDLA Piper will relocate Baltimore office back downtown after two decades‚Äù Aug. 29).

Most of downtown‚Äôs ‚Äúbiggies‚Äù completely shut down their offices for two years to allow their employees to work from home while the small businesses that were dependent on them for survival were forced to close or sharply reduce their business. It has been a case of the haves and the have-nots. The biggies did not care. There was a time now long past when Baltimore corporate leaders were our city‚Äôs boosters. Through everything that Baltimore has endured ‚Äî the relentless violence the obsession with (but lack of action regarding) the squeegee kids (entirely at the expense of small downtown businesses) the loss of jobs the decimation of the central business district the closing of small businesses the continuous population decline uncompetitive real estate tax rates (while favored big developers and large companies are beneficiaries of huge special tax breaks at the expense of residents and small businesses) there has been utter and complete silence from our business and civic leaders.

You cannot name the leader of any large company or nonprofit organization who has spoken publicly to raise the concerns that are on everybody‚Äôs mind. They are either afraid to do so or they do not care. They simply stand by while our city is dying. Doing nothing and saying nothing. It is tragic. It is morally reprehensible.

There are many reasons to indulge in a Costco membership apart from the one-of-a-kind return policy and cheap food court favorites. With inflation peaking in June of this year saving money is a top priority for many Americans and what better way to save than by grabbing a giant to-go pizza for under $10 and stocking up on an affordable rotisserie chicken for later in the week.

Spending $4.99 on a 3-pound bird seems like a great deal but there's more to the price than meets the wallet so to speak. In 2019 Costco made the move to bring chicken production in-house by opening up its own processing plant in Nebraska which was estimated to save the company ""10 to 35 cents per bird"" (via Grocery Dive).

However those extra cents saved come with the potential price of customers seeing the light regarding their favorite Costco chickens. Not only have Costco employees exposed the difficult working conditions on Reddit in Costco's ""chicken room"" but more social media users have been talking about the animal cruelty behind the beloved $4.99 favorite since Costco was sued this summer for inhumane animal practices (via CNN).

You may think the talk must end somewhere but unfortunately Reddit users are also discussing if these affordable birds are actually cooked when purchased."

More freight trains are rolling through Maine as cargo ship traffic ramps up in New Brunswick

By Bill Trotter Bangor Daily News Staff At the Port of Saint John in New Brunswick 70 miles east of the Maine border there‚Äôs been a flurry of change recently and it‚Äôs been aggressively expanded to handle more vessels looking to deliver shipments to the East Coast. Meanwhile the port is also pursuing upgrades to the province‚Äôs rail network to better distribute the cargo to points west and south.

By Bill Trotter Bangor Daily News Staff

At the Port of Saint John in New Brunswick 70 miles east of the Maine border there‚Äôs been a flurry of change recently and it‚Äôs been aggressively expanded to handle more vessels looking to deliver shipments to the East Coast. Meanwhile the port is also pursuing upgrades to the province‚Äôs rail network to better distribute the cargo to points west and south.

As major cargo ports in North America struggle with a backlog of ships waiting to unload more freight trains are passing through Maine brightening the economic prospects of far-flung Maine towns along the rail route. But it‚Äôs not without challenge ‚Äî for some Maine towns the trains are also bringing complications.

In Vanceboro U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has decided to cut back on the hours that vehicles can drive across the St. Croix River which separates the two countries so it can shift personnel to handle the increase in rail traffic. In Jackman about 150 miles west along the tracks cars and trucks face long waits as the trains stop traffic on Route 201 and the blast of the trains‚Äô horns ‚Äî a safety requirement when it crosses the road ‚Äî sometimes wakes people in the middle of the night.

But for Ken Stannix the mayor of McAdam the increase in rail traffic through his town into the U.S. represents a much-needed economic boost for rural towns in northern Maine and southwest New Brunswick.

Stannix said hundreds of millions of Canadian dollars have been spent on recent improvements to the port in Saint John and tens of millions more in Canadian currency is being spent to improve the rail line from Saint John through McAdam which is just five miles east of Vanceboro. He said two trains each of them nearly two miles long leave McAdam and cross the border at Vanceboro every day but that number is expected to increase to 12 in the next three years ‚Äî a jump of 500 percent.

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt spend that money to have a couple of freight trains roll through Vanceboro‚Äù Stannix said of the New Brunswick rail improvements. ‚ÄúThe growth prospects are huge. New Brunswick and Maine stand to gain from this growth.‚Äù

Improving east-west transportation corridors through Maine has long been a goal of economic development officials who see Maine‚Äôs long looping border with Canada as an asset. Maine borders the Canadian provinces of Quebec to the northwest and New Brunswick to the east giving the state the shortest route between the maritime provinces and the rest of Canada. Roughly 20 million people live in the heavily populated corridor just across Maine‚Äôs western border between Quebec City and Windsor Ontario.

The Canadian corridor also serves as a gateway for railroads transporting goods to Midwest cities such as Detroit and Chicago.

The United States is also investing in rail in Maine. Nate Moulton Maine Department of Transportation‚Äôs director of freight and passenger rail services said $35 million in public and private funding has been used in the past two years to improve freight capabilities on Maine rail lines south of Bangor in large part to handle the increased cargo shipments coming from Saint John.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no question there is increased freight rail traffic in Maine and it will continue‚Äù Moulton said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got some really good rail operators now. They need material they need fuel they need crews. It helps give us a robust rail infrastructure in Maine.‚Äù

In addition to bringing new jobs to part of the state that has lost many in recent decades through the decline of paper mills and other manufacturing businesses the expansion of freight rail service in Maine has the potential to attract other businesses that want to take advantage of the growing transportation route Moulton said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good jobs for Maine‚Äù he said of the impact of increasing rail traffic. ‚ÄúThere are a lot of good things happening.‚Äù

The most recently arrived rail operators in Maine are Canadian Pacific and CSX which have acquired local rail lines in Maine to tap into the large volumes of freight coming across the border.

After pulling out of Maine in 1995 Canadian Pacific returned two years ago when it acquired Central Maine and Quebec Railway extending its reach from the West Coast and Midwest to Brownville Hermon and Searsport. Through an agreement with Canadian firm NBM Railways ‚Äî which owns tracks that extend east from Brownville through Mattawamkeag and Vanceboro to Saint John ‚Äî Canadian Pacific has direct access to the New Brunswick cargo port.

Earlier this summer Florida-based CSX acquired Pan Am Railways extending its reach from Illinois and Florida through New England to Bangor and Mattawamkeag. Prior to the purchase Pan Am had applied for a federal grant to help cover half of the estimated $42 million cost of rebuilding its line between Waterville and Mattawamkeag a distance of about 110 miles which will allow the line to carry heavier and longer trains from Saint John according to online trade publication Atlantic Northeast Rails & Ports.

In addition CSX and the Federal Railroad Administration are splitting the bill on $35 million worth of improvements on its line between Yarmouth and Waterville. The company has not yet started upgrading the line from Waterville through Bangor to Mattawamkeag but a CSX spokeswoman said that work is expected to begin next year.

Since 2020 Canadian Pacific has spent $90 million upgrading rail lines in Maine and Quebec and its service through Maine to Saint John has significantly increased said Andy Cummings a company spokesman. Because of the heavier freight traffic across Maine the company worked with U.S. border officials to open a new container inspection station in Jackman earlier this year.

Cummings said the railroad also transports Maine forest products to customers out of state and has been looking for other ways to grow its rail service in Maine. It also has jobs to fill in Brownville.

‚ÄúOverall business [in Maine and Quebec] has grown more substantially than we anticipated when we acquired the line‚Äù Cummings said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The picture shows the devastation caused after a young driver fell asleep at the wheel and ploughed into the side of a house in North Yorkshire.

Jacob Cummins 20 was jailed for eight months at York Crown Court last month for causing serious injury by dangerous driving.

The crash left his friend 20-year-old Connor Campbell-Miles fighting for his life in hospital.

He suffered life-changing injuries and had to have part of his bowel removed in surgery.

The court heard that Cummins of Main Street Sledmere had been awake for 20 hours since getting up for work at 6am the previous morning until the crash in the early hours of 16 September last year.

He finished work at 8pm on 15 September and then picked up Connor and another friend to go for a night out in York.

They spent the night in the city centre with some women friends who said Cummins ‚Äúdrank some alcohol during the night ‚Äì two bottles of VK (alcopop) and one or two pints of beer‚Äù said prosecutor Andrew Finlay.

They stayed in York till about 2am. One of the women said she offered to take the three men home in her car and even bring Cummins back to York the following morning to collect his vehicle but he insisted on driving.

‚ÄòThink about the consequences‚Äô

Jacob Cummins

Defence solicitor David Camidge said although a breath test showed that Cummins had alcohol in his system he was under the drink-drive limit and the main reason for the crash was his lack of sleep which left him very tired.

The crash left a 6ft-by-6ft hole in the wall at the side of the house in Thornton Lane High Marishes.

[adrotate group=‚Äù3‚Ä≥]

A house beam went straight through the windscreen and impaled the front passenger seat which was mercifully empty after the car smashed through a fence and straight into the side of the house.

Fortunately the residents inside were unhurt.

Connor from Sherburn near Malton had been asleep in the back seat when the crash happened. He told the court his parents had ‚Äúcome to my (hospital) bedside to say goodbye‚Äù because his prospects were so bleak.

He said he had been left in unbearable agony faced more surgery and was practically ‚Äúunemployable‚Äù because employers were reluctant to take him on due to his physical condition.

Today North Yorkshire Police issued a photo of the crash scene and said: ‚ÄúLast week a North Yorkshire man received an eight month prison sentence after he fell asleep while driving home from a night out after being awake for 21 hours.

‚ÄúHe crashed his car broke a fence and caused extensive damage to a residential property.

‚ÄúBut far worse than that he had a passenger in the car ‚Äì a friend who was getting a lift home.

‚ÄúThe passenger was asleep at the time of the crash and suffered serious injuries.

‚ÄúWe know that it‚Äôs not always possible to avoid driving when you‚Äôre tired but please think about the consequences.

‚ÄúAt the first signs of tiredness stop and take a break.

‚ÄúPull over safely and give yourself chance to rest. It could well be the power nap which saves your life.‚Äù

By 2030 Ireland‚Äôs Climate Action Plan has committed to generating 80% of electricity through renewable sources.

Currently it produces about 80% through fossil fuels. Eirgrid‚Äôs most recent figures for this week show coal generating 15.5%; gas generating 73.8% and renewables generating just 4.6%.

Amber alerts on Ireland‚Äôs electricity grid this summer jolted many to the cold realities of potential energy blackouts this winter.

The war in Ukraine has cast a glaring light on Ireland‚Äôs ‚Äî and Europe‚Äôs energy insecurity.

Data centres ‚Äî a growing part of Ireland‚Äôs economy ‚Äî have also been under the spotlight for draining the national grid of energy at a time of scarcity.

But offshore floating wind power means energy scarcity does not need to feature in Ireland‚Äôs energy lexicon in the future Dr Val Cummins director of Simply Blue Group and former marine scientist and academic said.

Sometimes dubbed the ‚ÄúSaudi Arabia of wind energy‚Äù Ireland could both secure its own energy supply and become a major exporter of wind-derived energy and technology while boosting and protecting marine environments for the benefit of both biodiversity and the fishing industry Dr Cummins said. Floating wind power is a win-win for everyone she said.

The opportunities are great but so is the responsibility to implement speedier while still robust processes for bringing renewable energy sources on stream.

‚ÄúNow is our moment‚Äù Dr Cummins said.

‚ÄúWe were inward-looking as an island. We had our back to the sea ‚Äî until now. Now that‚Äôs changing.

The biggest opportunity we have to increase our renewable energy output of all the technologies ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs offshore wind solar biomass or onshore wind ‚Äî is floating offshore wind. That‚Äôs an enormous opportunity for this country.

‚ÄúWe have such an incredible maritime area as a small island nation. Our marine area is seven times our landmass.

‚ÄúFloating wind technology can be deployed off the south coast and off the west coast where the continental shelf lends itself really really well to an opportunity to get up to and beyond 30GW of floating offshore wind [30 gigawatts would power about 30m homes she said] which is in the Programme for Government.

‚ÄúIt's key to get us to net zero [carbon emissions] by 2050 but it‚Äôs also an opportunity not just to be self-sufficient in terms of our own energy demand but also to supply energy to Europe and elsewhere.‚Äù

An academic in University College Cork for 20 years Dr Cummins moved to industry two years ago and is now director at Simply Blue Group a marine resource company which aims to operate some of Ireland‚Äôs first floating offshore wind farms.

The biggest opportunity we have to increase our renewable energy output of all the technologies ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs offshore wind solar biomass or onshore wind ‚Äî is floating offshore wind. That‚Äôs an enormous opportunity for this country.

Floating wind as a technology can unlock Ireland‚Äôs potential as a renewable energy producer she believes.

Unlike the more common fixed-bottom offshore wind farms floating wind turbines are anchored to the seabed rather than being pile-driven into it lessening its environmental impact.

They can operate in deeper water so can be deployed off Ireland‚Äôs wind-rich west and south coasts which will be a game-changer for Ireland‚Äôs wind-power generation Dr Cummins said.

And because they can operate in deeper water further from the coast they are invisible or barely visible out on the horizon line so should spark fewer complaints from people worried about visual impact.

Two offshore floating wind projects which would be Ireland‚Äôs first are planned by Simply Blue Group one for Cork and one for Clare.

The Cork offshore wind farm called the Emerald Project would produce 1.3GW of energy and cost some ‚Ç¨2bn with an additional ‚Ç¨100m in planning costs.

Currently some 28GW of floating wind opportunities are being explored by developers in Ireland.

Outdated laws and regulations coupled with chronic understaffing in regulatory bodies have been holding up projects.

But a new body the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority (Mara) is due to be set up from January giving the industry hope that projects will be faster to progress from next year.

One of this new State agency‚Äôs major functions will be to regulate and issue a new type of licence called a Maritime Area Consent (Mac) which are effectively seabed leases. This lease will allow a specified area of the seabed to be used for a specified purpose ‚Äî like wind turbines ‚Äî with terms and conditions and a payment levy attached.

It replaces foreshore licences previously issued under the old Foreshore Act. A Mac is needed before a wind energy company can begin proper feasibility studies on a site and before it can apply for planning permission from An Bord Plean√°la.

Mara will also issue foreshore licences from the Minister for Housing Local Government and Heritage.

Mara was established under legislation enacted in December 2021. The Maritime Area Planning Act 2021 was heralded by Government as ‚Äúthe biggest reform of marine governance since the foundation of the state‚Äù.

The act provides the legal and administrative underpinning for a new planning regime in the maritime area facilitating the development of offshore energy.

Adequately resourcing Mara is crucial so Macs can be issued efficiently from early 2023 Dr Cummins said.

Better resourcing An Bord Plean√°la is also key so that vital infrastructure projects like wind farms can begin to be built.

Data centres ‚Äî a growing part of Ireland‚Äôs economy ‚Äî have also been under the spotlight for draining the national grid of energy at a time of scarcity.

An offshore floating wind farm takes about 10 years and billions of euro to bring on stream so avoiding unnecessary delays is crucial if Ireland is to hit its offshore wind targets ‚Äî by 2030 Ireland's Climate Action Plan commits to developing 5GW of offshore wind energy.

Getting Ireland to its net-zero carbon goal by 2050 will require wind power plants generating 25GW of electricity.

The current Programme for Government has set targets of 30GW of floating offshore wind from 2030.

The European Commission aims to increase Europe‚Äôs offshore wind capacity from its current level of 12gw to 300gw by 2050.

1GW can power about 1m homes. Moneypoint power station produces less than 1GW for comparison.

And change is possible. Data from the US Energy Administration identifies seven countries at or very nearly 100% renewable power ‚Äî Iceland (100 percent) Paraguay (100) Costa Rica (99) Norway (98.5) Austria (80) Brazil (75) and Denmark (69.4).

Ireland by contrast is still overwhelmingly reliant on fossil duels.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going in the right direction but it‚Äôs the speed of it in the context of the urgency in which we need to see the change delivered‚Äù Dr Cummins said.

‚ÄúOver the last two years in particular Government has really been proactive in putting a robust national marine planning framework in place. We didn‚Äôt have that surprisingly until now even though we are an island nation we were relying on very outdated legislation for planning for the foreshore.

‚ÄúWhereas now we have a whole new raft of legislation that‚Äôs a very important part of the jigsaw. But we need to keep that acceleration keep that pressure on in terms of the next pieces of the jigsaw that need to be put together.

""Government needs a roadmap for how to use this resource. Knowing we have an ambition for 30GW and more what‚Äôs the roadmap for industry and civil society and Government working together to drive that forward?‚Äù

Offshore wind has raised concerns amongst some fishers concerned wind farms may spring up in their most fertile fishing grounds and therefore limit their access to fish stock.

Conservationists have been concerned about offshore wind‚Äôs impact on migrating birds and marine life.

Calls have been made for Government to speed up allocation of protected marine conservation areas where marine life can thrive without human interference before the seabed is carved up by wind energy companies.

But Dr Cummins said offshore wind companies can and must work in tandem with all stakeholders to create positive outcomes for the marine environment and for the people who depend on it for a living.

‚ÄúWe have an opportunity to work together. That‚Äôs hugely important ‚Äî coexistence with the fishers but also coexistence with other key stakeholders key interests including and importantly NGOs who are really and rightly concerned with the designation of areas offshore as marine protected areas of conservation.

There‚Äôs a wonderful opportunity for floating windfarms offshore to become de facto marine conservation areas. If they‚Äôre ‚Äòno-take‚Äô zones for fishing then they‚Äôre biological hotspots.

‚ÄúOffshore floating wind can be part of an integrated solution to enhancing marine conservation and helping to create healthier oceans as well as renewable energy contributing to decarbonisation and reaching climate targets‚Äù Dr Cummins said.

Fishers noticed the sea teaming with life around the gas field off Kinsale when the project was decommissioned she said.

Offshore wind has raised concerns amongst some fishers concerned wind farms may spring up in their most fertile fishing grounds and therefore limit their access to fish stock.

And floating offshore wind can work in synergy with other marine stakeholders ‚Äî allowing marine life a safe space to grow ultimately boosting catch for fishers who face increasingly empty nets she said.

Floating offshore wind has already been deployed around Europe and the onus is now on Ireland to catch up Dr Cummins said.

Floating offshore wind farms are already used off the northeast coast of the England off the coast of Aberdeen in Scotland off Portugal and Norway.

‚ÄúThe latest project to come on stream is off Norway where there‚Äôs a floating wind farm being developed by Equinor to power an offshore oil or gas production platform‚Äù Dr Cummins said.

‚ÄúAnd the next project to come after that will be ours Simply Blue Group which will be in the Celtic Sea off the coast of Pembroke. It‚Äôs a project we‚Äôve been developing with Total Energies. It will produce 96MW floating wind that should be operational by 2026.

‚ÄúWind Europe estimates that there will be 7GW of floating wind in deployment in Europe alone by 2030. So it‚Äôs a sector that‚Äôs really accelerating. Lots of European countries have really embraced it and declared ambitious targets for deployment.‚Äù

Along with England Scotland Portugal and Norway Spain France Sweden and Italy are also working to develop floating offshore wind.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great. But they don‚Äôt have the extent of the resource we have. We have the Wild Atlantic Way ‚Äî it‚Äôs not called that for nothing. In technical jargon it has a good capacity factor‚Äù Dr Cummins said.

So we have the marine space we have fantastic wind. We need to really ramp up and build on work done by Government in the last couple of years and show commitment in terms of the road map for floating wind.‚Äù

The Programme for Government originally committed to 5GW of installed offshore wind capacity by 2030 which was recently augmented by another 2GW bringing the target to 7GW by 2030. It also aimed to produce a long-term plan to take advantage of a potential of at least 30GW of floating wind thereafter.

IGW can power roughly 1m homes Dr Cummins said.

For comparison Moneypoint power station generates 915 MW so less than 1GW.

‚ÄúI was 21 years with UCC before moving to Simply Blue Group two years ago. My whole career was in marine science and marine resource management. When I crossed over to industry I was really motivated by the opportunity to have an impact in relation to being really smart about utilisation of our ocean resource.

I always felt we could be doing so much more as a maritime nation but really in terms of the climate change piece really seeing the opportunities of floating offshore wind to be a massive contributor to getting to net zero.

‚ÄúBut also since I joined Simply Blue it‚Äôs been about what needs to happen now to help with energy security issues which have become really really intensified over the last six months.

""And back to that piece around marine conservation and thinking about protecting the oceans but having these turbines out there like sentinels of the sea. It‚Äôs a whole new way of looking at things it‚Äôs exciting it‚Äôs the future.

‚ÄúThis Programme for Government put down an ambition for producing at least 30GW ‚Äî that‚Äôs 30m homes.

‚ÄúBut just a few weeks ago Minister Ryan announced the first big step which is to do 2GW floating wind ‚Äî you have to walk before you can run ‚Äî which would be used for the production of green hydrogen.‚Äù

Sometimes dubbed the ‚ÄúSaudi Arabia of wind energy‚Äù Ireland could both secure its own energy supply and become a major exporter of wind-derived energy and technology while boosting and protecting marine environments for the benefit of both biodiversity and the fishing industry Dr Cummins said.

When you talk about floating offshore wind you very quickly get to the subject of green hydrogen she said.

""Because with the opportunity to do 30GW offshore you have to ask where that electricity is going to go?

‚ÄúAnd certainly there‚Äôs a great opportunity to feed it into the grid here displacing sources like Moneypoint but also that electricity can be sent directly to your interconnector in terms of exporting electrons.

""Or we could export gas ‚Äî so using electricity from the offshore floating wind farms to power a process onshore of electrolysis which basically splits water into hydrogen and oxygen and when you do that you get green hydrogen.

‚ÄúGreen hydrogen becomes a fundamental component of e-fuel production.

‚ÄúAnd where you have your hydrogen if you take nitrogen out of the atmosphere which is regularly available and you put them together you can produce green ammonia.

‚ÄúGreen ammonia is used in fertiliser and Ireland has huge demand for that in terms of farming. And the global demand for green ammonia is absolutely huge.

""But it can also be used as a fuel ‚Äî and e-fuel ‚Äî for shipping. Ships can be adapted to run on green ammonia and again these are the enormous opportunities that Ireland has.

‚ÄúWhen I go back to my roadmap for offshore floating wind we have made a baby step in relation to the announcement of 2Ggw to produce green hydrogen but that‚Äôs a fundamental first step ‚Äî because it will show that we can do it it will be proof of concept. Then we can build on that. And that then becomes a game changer not just for decarbonisation and energy security and the marine environment but also for regional development. Because a lot of this will happen for example off the west coast.""

Floating offshore wind therefore creates huge opportunities for the regeneration of rural coastal Ireland.

We have an opportunity for a whole new economic sector in rural coastal Ireland which will breathe life back into communities which are really feeling the pain of the demise of for example the fishing sector.

""So it is such an exciting story because it hits economy it hits environment it hits society it‚Äôs just there for the taking.

""I think there‚Äôs a fantastic sense of the opportunity across the board. I think Government sees it and realises it.

""The challenge is that we don‚Äôt have enough capacity in key Government departments and agencies to move on this fast enough. And that's what we need to see ‚Äî we need to see more bandwidth in the likes of Mara the National Parks and Wildlife Service in An Bord Plean√°la and all of these key instruments of the State that need to work together to put the framework in place for us to do this at scale.

""Because the opportunity is one of incredible scale. 30GW is there as a number. We will need most of that to decarbonise ourselves to get to 2050. Some analysis will say there‚Äôs 50GW off the south coast and 80GW off the west coast. It is huge in terms of opportunity and the opportunity Ireland has is unique. We can develop this at a scale that other countries will never be able to do.

""But we need to be early movers. We need to ensure we‚Äôre getting access to the supply chain and developing the supply chain for ourselves. And the more that we stay at the current pace the increased risk is that other countries will storm ahead and we‚Äôll be left behind.

""So we need to action this now. Now is our moment."""

The ACLU of Rhode Island is raising concerns over the data CVS is collecting as part of its COVID booster shot program.

In a letter sent to CVS President Karen Lynch ACLU of Rhode Island Director Steven Brown questioned the retail pharmacy‚Äôs requirement that demographic data ‚Äî including gender and ethnicity ‚Äî be provided in order for a person to be eligible for a booster shot.

‚ÄúWhile we can appreciate the utility of seeking and obtaining this demographic data I trust you would agree that it is not in the best interest of public health if even a few people are discouraged from obtaining Covid vaccination because of a request for what is ultimately extraneous information‚Äù wrote Brown.

SEE FULL LETTER BELOW

When asked for comment CVS provided the following response.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre committed to providing equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines regardless of an individual‚Äôs sex gender race ethnicity or other characteristics not relevant to current vaccine eligibility requirements‚Äù said Amy Thibault CVS‚Äô Director for External Communications.

‚ÄúAs a participant in the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for vaccinations we‚Äôre required to report certain clinical information to the CDC‚Äù Thibault added.

CVS however did not respond to the following questions:

Do you require all of the information -- sex gender race ethnicity -- for someone to get a booster shot?

Is it required by the federal government to collect all of this information -- specifically sex gender race and ethnicity?

Pursuant to these two questions -- if a person does not provide sex gender race or ethnicity information -- are they then not allowed to get a shot?

Thibault provided information on the newly authorized bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccines.

This week scheduling vaccine boosters at CVS was halted temporarily to accommodate the latest development.

‚ÄúWe plan to offer the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccines once authorized by the CDC and once we have received supply. Following FDA authorization on August 31 the government‚Äôs distribution of the bivalent boosters started immediately. We expect our pharmacies to begin to receive supply on a rolling basis over the next few days and appointments will be made available at CVS.com and via the CVS Pharmacy app‚Äù said Thibault. ‚ÄúWe continue to provide our communities with convenient access to vaccines at CVS Pharmacy including the approved COVID-19 primary series as well as flu and a number of other vaccinations such as pneumonia and shingles.‚Äù



‚ÄúAs announced by the FDA [Wednesday‚Äô the emergency use authorization (EUA) of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines has been updated to remove the use of the original monovalent Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines for booster administration‚Äù said Thibault. ‚ÄúFor that reason patients will need to reschedule appointments for COVID-19 boosters to allow for the administration of the bivalent vaccine once approved by the CDC and received by our pharmacies. CVS.com and the CVS Pharmacy app will be updated as doses are received.‚Äù

The federal government stopped delivering free at-home Covid tests to Americans on Friday suspending a program that has provided more than 600 million tests to U.S. households since it launched at the beginning of this year. The White House blames lawmakers for the program's suspension noting on the program's website that ""Congress hasn't provided additional funding to replenish the nation's stockpile of tests."" If and when Congress passes additional funding the government will ""expeditiously resume"" the distribution of free at-home tests a White House official told NBC News.

Most at-home Covid tests don't detect the virus as well as laboratory-based tests like PCRs according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. But they can still detect Covid at least 80% of the time meaning that positive test results are ""typically accurate.""

They can be taken anywhere and are much faster than other tests providing results in minutes. PCR tests take hours or even up to a few days to do the same.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends taking at-home tests:

Immediately if you have any Covid symptoms

Immediately if you're about to attend a gathering or event with a lot of people

At least five days after exposure if you were exposed to someone with Covid

If you do test positive the at-home tests could later be a useful tool for determining whether you've finished the course of your infection.

The CDC says a negative test result ""doesn't rule out an infection"" and ""may not be reliable"" especially if you have symptoms. Consider taking an at-home test again 24 to 48 hours after your first test to ""increase confidence"" that you aren't infected the agency notes.

Essentially if you test negative with an at-home test you should take another test one or two days later before considering yourself fully in the clear.

Flights used to be a chance to sit back (albeit a bit cramped) and watch a recently released movie or catch up on some reading. Now they‚Äôre just another place to log on.

Delta and United each host more than 1.5 million inflight WiFi sessions a month the airlines told CNN Business while JetBlue said its service is used by ‚Äúmillions of customers‚Äù every year. Southwest declined to share specific numbers but said inflight Wifi is ‚Äúpopular.‚Äù

Alaska Airlines meanwhile estimates that about 35% of its passengers on average make use of its $8 onboard WiFi services which include surfing the web and streaming.

While most airlines will allow certain messaging apps for free full internet access in the skies usually comes at a premium with Delta charging nearly $50 for a monthly pass on US flights (though the airline plans to switch to a $5 per flight per device offering by the end of this year). But with a market that‚Äôs currently estimated at around $5 billion and projected to grow to more than $12 billion by 2030 according to research firm Verified Market Research there‚Äôs a lot of room for improvement.

Inflight internet has been around for nearly two decades with aircraft manufacturer Boeing announcing its service known as Connexion in April 2000 and debuting it on a Munich-Los Angeles Lufthansa flight in 2004. Boeing discontinued the service in 2006 saying the market for it had ‚Äúnot materialized‚Äù as expected. But the advent of smartphones and subsequent efforts by a host of satellite providers and airlines have helped the technology evolve significantly in the past decade ‚Äî though it still has some catching up to do in order to compare to home and office networks.

How it works

There are two main types of inflight connections. The first known as air-to-ground or ATG relies on antennae attached to the aircraft that catch the signal from cellphone towers on the ground.

Intelsat which launched air-to-ground services with American Airlines in 2008 currently operates a version of the technology on more than 1000 aircraft across North America.

The one major drawback of this technology is that much like cellphone service on the ground it is dependent on the density and connectivity of towers and so flights over rural areas deserts or large water bodies are likely to suffer drops in connectivity. The maximum speeds for these systems are currently around 5 megabits per second (which is shared by hundreds of passengers) according to Andrew Zignani a research director at technology intelligence firm ABI Research who specializes in wireless connectivity. By comparison median global download speeds for mobile and fixed broadband are around 30 megabits per second and 67 megabits per second respectively according to recent data from monitoring app Speedtest.

‚ÄúTo date the biggest issues have been speed limited availability gaps in coverage dropouts and price‚Äù Zignani told CNN Business.

That‚Äôs why airlines and providers are increasingly switching to satellite-based connections that are relatively less susceptible to interruptions because they can more effectively cover the entirety of the flight path from space and keep the signal active as it moves through the air.

That includes Intelsat which has a network of over 50 satellites serving airlines such as Alaska American Delta United Air Canada British Airways and Cathay Pacific.

‚ÄúAs regional jet fleets are refreshed we expect the majority to migrate to satellite-based solutions‚Äù Jeff Sare Intelsat‚Äôs president of commercial aviation told CNN Business.

Viasat another major provider used by several airlines around the world uses its own network of satellites that provide high-speed connectivity and is gearing up to launch another satellite constellation later this year. The company debuted its services with JetBlue in 2013 and now serves more than a dozen airlines around the world.

But even satellite connections are currently capable of around 100 megabits per second per aircraft or around 15 megabits per second per passenger device a far cry from the speeds terrestrial WiFi is capable of.

Many airlines use a combination of WiFi providers and types of technologies depending on the type of aircraft and routes they need to be deployed on.

Newer players such as Starlink the satellite internet service run by billionaire Elon Musk‚Äôs company SpaceX are also entering the fray. Earlier this year SpaceX announced a partnership with Hawaiian Airlines to provide high-speed internet through Starlink‚Äôs network of low-earth orbit satellites.

‚ÄúSome of these solutions also adopt a hybrid approach combining the best of both technologies to ensure optimal coverage depending on the specific flight path‚Äù said Zignani. ‚ÄúI believe we will see opportunities for all technologies in the coming years and recent partnerships are showing that each technology will have its own part to play‚Äù he added.

Challenges and opportunities

There are still gaps between inflight WiFi and the networks you would use in your home office a coffee shop or anywhere on the ground.

While most airline WiFi connections now support messaging and social media functions and some even have live TV and video streaming capabilities providing users with the same level of bandwidth and connectivity mid-air can be a challenge.

‚ÄúThe biggest point of difference for inflight WiFi is the complexity added by the mobility element‚Äù Don Buchman vice president and general manager for commercial aviation at Viasat told CNN Business. ‚ÄúThe aircraft is traveling at a high rate of speed typically banking during the flight and often flying across large geographical areas that demand consistent coverage for a high-quality in-flight connectivity experience.‚Äù

And while satellites solve for some of the restrictions that cellphone towers face expanding the satellite network to keep up with increasing demand is not always straightforward.

As Sare of Intelsat puts it: ‚ÄúIt is much faster and cheaper to deploy new cellular towers than to launch a satellite on a rocket.‚Äù

In a survey by Intelsat last year of airlines service providers and equipment manufacturers 65% of respondents said they anticipate increases in the number of passengers who expect to be connected while flying. The two biggest impediments to increasing inflight WiFi adoption the survey indicated were the high price of the service and ‚Äúpoor internet connection.‚Äù

Companies such as Viasat Intelsat and Starlink continue to expand that capacity however launching more satellites every year in anticipation of the growing demand for their services. That added capacity will not only enhance the online experience for users but could also potentially give airlines more avenues to monetize and lower the price.

‚ÄúOne example is ad sponsored inflight WiFi so passengers can access WiFi for free and use it however they would like‚Äù Buchman said adding that Viasat is also exploring ways to use its connectivity services to help airlines with functions such as crew management and aircraft maintenance.

The biggest priority according to Sare of Intelsat is shortening the time it takes to make those technological advances happen and he foresees more partnerships between companies to help move the industry standard forward.

‚ÄúOur vision is achieved when passengers can‚Äôt tell the difference between being connected on the ground and in the air.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vdWsubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9mbGV3LWRlbHRhcy1ib2VpbmctNzY3LXN3ZWRlbi0xMTM5MDA5MTEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I flew on Delta's Boeing 767 from Sweden to New York in economy and it was the best transatlantic flight I've taken in a ...,"Delta Air Lines is the world's largest operator of the Boeing 767 widebody jet receiving its first in 1982.

After security I made my way through the airport passing through a large duty-free area before heading to gate 17.

The duty free area was not crowded. Taylor Rains/Insider

The gate was actually in a secure area just past a passport control checkpoint where my document was checked for the third time.

I flew on Air Canada in economy from London to Montreal and while the Boeing 787 was comfortable the food was a real disappointment

Fortunately the carrier's food was much better and I'd go as far as to say it was actually one of the tastiest economy meals I've had on an airliner. The curry was creamy‚Ä¶

I know the curry looks questionable but it was delicious mixed with the rice. Taylor Rains/Insider

The aromas of airplane food are once again wafting through cabins at 35000 feet. From vegan meatballs to ice cream sundaes airlines are offering new options and old favorites to woo returning travelers. As the peak travel season fades and inflation weighs on household and company budgets it's even more important than usual for airlines to court passengers. Airplane food a favorite travel punchline for comedians is hardly the top reason why travelers choose a carrier ‚Äî price and schedule are much stronger factors. But it can be a creature comfort on board and can go a long way toward winning over passengers especially those who are willing to pay up for premium seats analysts say. ""Food is one of the most tangible signals of what an airline thinks of its customers"" said Henry Harteveldt founder of travel consulting firm Atmosphere Research Group and a former airline executive. The start of the Covid-19 pandemic halted almost all food and beverage service on flights as travel collapsed and airlines limited crews' contact with passengers to avoid spreading the virus. The pandemic drove airlines to record losses and had them looking to cut costs wherever possible such as in-flight food. With travel returning airlines around the world are rolling out new menu options. Alcohol sales with some new ready-to-drink options are back on board in U.S. coach cabins. And face masks are now mostly optional removing an obstacle to onboard food and beverage service. As tastes change and airlines face supply chain challenges the meal on your seat-back tray table is making a comeback ‚Äî with some adjustments.

Chasing high-paying travelers

Better in-flight menus can boost a carrier's image and help it bring more high-paying travelers on board. First- and business-class customers are becoming even more of a prize as airlines try to recover from the pandemic's financial impact. Because of ""the incentive to win those premium class passengers the incentive to spend more money [on food] is high"" said Steve Walsh partner at management consulting firm Oliver Wyman in its transportation and services practice. Still food and beverage costs make up just about 3% of a full-service airline's expenses he estimated.

While food is for sale in many domestic coach cabins and is generally complimentary on long-haul international flights many of the new offerings target those in premium classes where there are fewer passengers and service is more elaborate. A plethora of videos have been posted online by airline passengers reviewing meals plating and service in detail. Popular staples such as Biscoff cookies and Stroopwaffel treats garner loyal followings and come to be expected by many travelers. Missteps on the menu or service are amplified on social media by disappointed travelers. One offering: Delta is serving passengers on long-haul international flights a new sundae-in-a-cup premixed with chocolate cherries and spiced Belgian cookies called speculoos which are known in North America as Biscoff cookies. ""Obviously it is an homage to the Biscoff"" said Mike Henny Deltas' managing director of onboard services operations. In more premium cabins such as Delta One on international flights passengers can build their own sundaes with a choice of toppings including Morello cherry compote chocolate sauce and speculoos cookie crumbles.

Delta in July said the revenue recovery in premium products and its extra-legroom seats was outpacing sales from standard coach ‚Äî further motivation to introduce new and exciting food items. Last week the airline said it is teaming up with James Beard Award winner Mashama Bailey executive chef of Savannah Georgia-based restaurant The Grey for ""Southern-inspired"" meals on flights out of Atlanta for domestic first-class passengers. Travelers on Delta One flying internationally out of the hub can also preorder menu items curated by Bailey. Airlines for years have teamed up with celebrity chefs to design their menus and lately have been working more with local businesses. In February American Airlines brought Tamara Turner's Silver Spoon Desserts' Bundt cakes on board domestic premium cabins.

Veggie and vegan

Even before the pandemic airlines were expanding options for travelers who prefer vegetarian and vegan meals. Now those types of alternative dishes are getting an even closer look. ""Pasta isn't always the solution"" said Delta's Henny. Singapore Airlines a carrier that operates some of the world's longest flights brought in Southern California-based luxury spa Golden Door to develop dozens of recipes for its in-flight menu. Golden Door's executive chef Greg Frey Jr. focuses on vegetable-forward dishes that he says are among the best for digestion on flights. ""I think people are rightly so concerned they're not going to feel as satiated with this vegetarian meal and [think] 'I just need this piece of meat.' And in the end ... you really don't need that much protein when you're sitting in an airplane and relaxing"" he said. ""It's not like you're heavy lifting.""

An hour later you're not going 'Ugh I wish I didn't have the meatballs.'"" Greg Frey Jr. executive chef at Golden Door

Frey developed a Portobello mushroom ""meat ball"" dish that's served with a risotto made with vegetable broth. The mushroom balls are steamed and served with an heirloom tomato sauce: ""There's not a lick of meat in there"" he said. ""It's so satisfying and you get all those umami flavors"" he said. ""The best part is an hour later you're not going 'Ugh I wish I didn't have the meatballs.'""

Supply chain puzzle

Greens and salads are among the most difficult dishes to serve on board. Airline chefs have to make sure ingredients are hardy enough to endure transportation and refrigeration making stronger greens such as kale a better option than some more delicate varieties. ""We have to be very choosy about what type of greens we offer"" said American Airlines spokeswoman Leah Rubertino. ""Arugula for example is not our friend."" The airline is offering salads on more flights compared with before the pandemic Rubertino said. The airline is also now offering a ""fiesta grain bowl"" with rice quinoa black beans cauliflower corn and zucchini as a vegetarian option in many first-class cabins for domestic flights. Airlines have been trying to source vegetables more locally giving their catering companies fresher ingredients and cutting down on transportation time and costs. Singapore Airlines since 2019 has been using greens from AeroFarms a vertical farm near Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey. Spokesman James Boyd said the airline has plans to source from other vertical farms close to the major airports it serves in the coming years.

The new chairman of the Senate Republican campaign arm had a mind to modernize the place. One of his first decisions was to overhaul how the group raised money online.

Mr. Scott installed a new digital team spearheaded by Trump veterans and greenlit an enormous wave of spending on digital ads not to promote candidates but to discover more small contributors.

If more than 2000 applications are received preference will be given to Form Three students.

‚ÄúSome may ask why only 2000 students will benefit. This is a trial programme. We will expand it to cover more students after an ongoing review‚Äù Chan said.

Hong Kong‚Äôs new scheme to mentor pupils living in subdivided flats

Authorities will invite commercial organisations and professional bodies to nominate mentors. Students in the programme will be recruited through community groups and schools. Mentors will help pupils with planning their lives and making the best use of the subsidies donated by the business sector.

‚ÄúWe hope to recruit more younger mentors because they can communicate better with the mentees. They should have a job and can arrange job shadowing‚Äù Chan said. ‚ÄúWe hope the mentors can also be able to share with their mentees how they faced difficulties in order to help mentees develop a positive attitude.‚Äù

Upon completion of the programme another HK$5000 will be awarded to students to fund their personal pursuits.

Activities for pupils would include group visits to public utilities government departments and museums. There are also plans for them to take a short flight. Participants will also undergo compulsory training in areas such as communication skills and financial planning. Mentors and parents will also be given training. Pupils can choose to take classes in Chinese or English language sports and music as well as social etiquette.

News: Hong Kong Olympic medal winners to act as tutors under new scheme

Hong Kong Olympic medallists among mentors in ‚ÄúStrive and Rise‚Äù scheme

Scheme serves as ‚Äúshort- to medium-term subsidy‚Äù rather than long-term support Form Three pupil says

Four Hong Kong Olympic medallists have been invited to act as tutors to junior secondary school pupils living in subdivided flats under a new scheme to tackle cross-generational poverty.

They are fencing gold medallist Edgar Cheung Ka-long and women‚Äôs table tennis team members Doo Hoi-kam Minnie Soo Wai-yam and Lee Ho-ching who took home a bronze at the 2020 Tokyo Games.

‚ÄúThese star tutors will increase the attractiveness of the scheme so that grass-roots students will no longer feel that their development will be restricted by their network‚Äù he said.

Others who have agreed to join the scheme as tutors are Dr Lo Yuen-yi the University of Hong Kong‚Äôs associate dean of faculty of education Hong Kong Harmonica Association founder Ho Pak-cheong renowned conductor Yip Wing-sze and violinist Yao Jue.

Form Three pupil Kelly Lee said she was interested in joining the scheme but its quota was too small the duration too short and the HK$10000 subsidy too little.

‚ÄúThis is not a form of long-term support it is more of a short- to medium-term subsidy‚Äù said the 14-year-old who lives in a subdivided flat.

What it‚Äôs like for a teen from a poor family caring for diabetic father

Using her violin lessons as an example she said a new instrument would cost at least HK$10000 and the average fee for a class was around HK$300 to HK$400.

She said she hoped the scheme would help her to plan her future career path and to visit events and places she had rarely been to such as concerts or theme parks.

Separately Sze Lai-shan deputy director of the Society for Community Organisation said the scheme was a move in the right direction but the one-year period was not long enough for mentors and mentees to develop a relationship. Sze added that the subsidy should be increased to HK$20000 per student and more pupils should be allowed to join.

Issue: Scheme for disadvantaged Hong Kong youth does not go far enough experts say

Academics warn ‚ÄúStrive and Rise‚Äù scheme will not tackle problems of intergenerational poverty on its own

More long-term commitment needed to ensure underprivileged children are lifted out of poverty cycle

The ‚ÄúStrive and Rise Programme‚Äù designed to help lift struggling Hong Kong secondary school pupils out of poverty is ‚Äúhalf-baked‚Äù experts have said.

Academics and social workers insisted that the government-organised scheme was not enough on its own and other major problems such as the housing crisis and low incomes had to be tackled as well.

‚ÄúThere must be elements of continuity in the scheme‚Äù said Amy Chan Kung Wai-ying the chairwoman of the Child Development Matching Fund a charity that has worked with the government to deliver similar programmes since 2009. ‚ÄúThe government should provide a ladder for them and also keep helping them move up along the way.‚Äù

According to Chan the scheme was too career-focused for such young children and the programme would not achieve its aims without follow-up measures. She appealed to authorities to allocate resources for continued support to the secondary pupils involved who would need guidance for several years.

Experts have also blamed worsening intergenerational poverty on the city‚Äôs growing income gap soaring cost of living and limited help programmes.

Lee Chun-wing a social sciences lecturer at Polytechnic University accused the government of a lack of new ideas and follow-up measures. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a half-baked plan as the government delivered no new ideas and no solid plans on tracking the progress of students‚Äù he said.

Why low-income Hongkongers are being pushed from one temporary flat to another

Lee said authorities tended to attribute intergenerational poverty to youngsters‚Äô lack of social skills and limited opportunities but the problem‚Äôs causes were more complex. He explained there was a critical need to review the city‚Äôs employment structure to close the poverty gap and boost the incomes of low-paid workers.

Lee also appealed for more immediate measures to be taken to improve living conditions for poorer schoolchildren so they had a suitable home environment to concentrate on their studies.

Sample answers

Context:

Why is the ‚ÄúStrive and Rise Programme‚Äù only applicable to students who live in subdivided flats? Use Glossary and your own knowledge to explain. (It is because this group of people are living in poverty and are likely to have the least financial means and access to the activities provided in the scheme. They are also more likely to face financial or other sorts of difficulties in their lives and they will benefit from the mentors‚Äô advice.

Which of the activities mentioned in Context do you think would benefit recipients of the scheme and why? (Training in terms of communication skills and financial planning because they will most likely be unable to afford such classes otherwise. These skills are also crucial for future success.)

News:

Do you think recruiting the four Hong Kong Olympians as mentors increases the attractiveness of the scheme? Explain. (Yes these athletes are inspirational figures for the city‚Äôs youth and they have each excelled in their respective sports. All of them are also under 30 and they will be able to better relate to the mentees.)

Why does Kelly Lee say the programme is ‚Äúmore of a short- to medium-term subsidy‚Äù than long-term support? Use Context News and Glossary to explain. (Having only 2000 spots is not enough to help the city‚Äôs 275000 youth living in poverty. HK$10000 is also too little to fund worthwhile pursuits such as enrolling in enrichment classes or starting their own business ventures. At the end of the day none of this addresses the root causes of their struggles.)

Issue:

What does Amy Chan mean when she says there must be ‚Äúelements of continuity in the scheme‚Äù? Explain your answer using News and Issue. (She means that the ‚ÄúStrive and Rise Programme‚Äù should not simply be a one-year subsidy scheme and its duration should be extended to that of a long-term programme. This way students‚Äô progress can be tracked to ensure that they truly benefit from it. As mentioned by Kelly Lee in News even though she is interested in the scheme the duration is barely enough for her to explore the possibility of a future career in music.)

Using your own knowledge and Glossary explain how widening income gap soaring cost of living and lack of help programmes cause intergenerational poverty. (Intergenerational poverty is passed on from one generation to the next. A widening income gap combined with soaring cost of living means that low-wage workers are not paid enough to maintain basic needs. If a parent does not make enough money to pay for rent for example then their children may struggle to focus on their studies when their home environment is unstable. These individuals may rely on the government to provide financial assistance but when there are not enough help programmes they have no choice but to fend for themselves.)

Cartoon:

Which group of people could the cat represent? (The task force in charge of the scheme / Wealthy people with a lot of power in the city)

What is the cat asking the kid to do and why is this tough for the kid? (The cat is asking the kid to get up while sitting on him making it hard for him to follow the instructions.)

What is the cartoon‚Äôs attitude towards the ‚ÄúStrive and Rise Programme‚Äù and why? Explain using News and Issue. (It expresses scepticism towards the scheme as shown by the cat sitting on the student while asking him to ‚Äústrive and rise‚Äù. This reflects the lack of thought in the ‚Äúhalf-baked‚Äù scheme as mentioned by the experts in News and Issue. Not only is the programme lacking in its duration subsidy amount and reach but it also assumes intergenerational poverty can be alleviated without considering other factors such as widening income gap and rising cost of living.)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9uZXdzL3dvcmxkL2NvdXBsZS1kaXNjb3Zlci1vdmVyLXJzLTItY3JvcmUtZ29sZC1jb2lucy1pbi1raXRjaGVuLWR1cmluZy1yZW5vdmF0aW9uLTExNjYyMTc0NTEwNzUzLmh0bWzSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGl2ZW1pbnQuY29tL25ld3Mvd29ybGQvY291cGxlLWRpc2NvdmVyLW92ZXItcnMtMi1jcm9yZS1nb2xkLWNvaW5zLWluLWtpdGNoZW4tZHVyaW5nLXJlbm92YXRpb24vYW1wLTExNjYyMTc0NTEwNzUzLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Couple discover over ‚Çπ2 crore gold coins in kitchen during renovation | Mint,"A life-changing event occurred in a UK couple's life when they decided to renovate their house. According to a report by The Times a UK-based couple found 264 gold coins under the floor of their kitchen. The North Yorkshire couple has decided to sell these ancient gold coins which are worth 250000 pounds ( ‚Çπ2.3 crore). The collection which is reportedly more than 400 years old will be sold through an auction which is being handled by Spink & Son.

The surprising discovery was made when the couple lifted the floorboard of their 18th-century detached property in the village of Ellerby. Initially the couple thought they had hit an electric cable when they lifted the floor. But they found a stash of coins inside a metal about the same size as a coke can buried just six inches under the concrete. The couple has been staying in that house for the past 10 years.

When the couple inspected the stash they found that the coins were dated from 1610 to 1727 during the reigns of James I and Charles I.

In a separate incident 86 gold coins were found in Madhya Pradesh's Dhar district in August this year. Eight labourers allegedly stole 86 gold coins worth about ‚Çπ60 lakh found by them during the demolition of an old house in Madhya Pradesh.

The labourers then distributed the 'ginnis' (gold coins) which may be of archaeological importance among themselves without informing local police following which they were arrested Additional Superintendent of Police Devendra Patidar said.

He said the labourers found the coins while removing the debris of an old house a few days back. Following a tip-off the police came to know that the eight labourers distributed the coins among themselves he said.

The police arrested these labourers and seized 86 coins collectively weighing around one kilogram.

The price of those coins is about ‚Çπ60 lakh but it may go up to ‚Çπone crore after ascertaining their archaeological significance.

This happened at 5 p.m. at the location on South Main Street in Hampstead.

The fire was so big that firefighters from Carroll Baltimore and York counties were on the scene and it took more than an hour to get it under control.

According to the Hampstead Volunteer Fire Department one firefighter was evaluated on scene for an injury but was not taken to the hospital. No other injuries were reported. It caused $2.5 million worth of damage to the store.

Now investigators are looking for two witnesses who may have seen something before the fire was discovered. The State Fire Marshal's office believes they are a mother and son. They showed up to the store just before 5 p.m. in a dark possibly green early model GMC safari van.

TikTok user iloveqpons picked up $32 worth of supplies from Dollar General but spent just $10.96 after applying coupons.

1 TikTok user iloveqpons picked up this cart full of items for less than $11

Tori who runs the account ultimately paid $1.56 per item for seven products from Gain and Febreze.

She posted a video explaining the exact offers she capitalized on to score her discount and said other shoppers can try it any day.

All of the coupons Tori used came from Dollar General's app.

The app includes hundreds of coupons for specific items and brands as well as general discounts that can knock $5 or $10 off your whole order.

To score her deal on cleaning products Tori first picked up two bottles of Gain Powerblast Spray for $4.75 each and clipped a $3.99 coupon.

Next she picked up a 65-ounce bottle of laundry detergent for $7.50 but knocked $2 off the price with another offer.

She also got a smaller cheaper bottle of detergent spending just $4.50 for a 45-ounce bottle after applying a $1 coupon.

Finally Tori grabbed two bottles of Febreze air freshener and a Febreze Small Spaces aromatic for $3.25 each all of which came with Gain scents.

She then used coupons to save $3.30 on the spray and $1 on the Small Spaces freshener.

All told these offers knocked more than $10 off her purchase.

In addition to the product coupons Tori took advantage of a deal offering $5 off a purchase of $30 or more of Gain products.

Since everything in her cart was from Gain she knocked her subtotal even further from $20.96 to $15.96.

Her receipt also came with a $5 off coupon for her next purchase of more than $5.01.

With the cashback she ended up spending slightly less than $11 for the seven products.

Most of the coupons Tori used expire on September 24 except for the $1 detergent deal that ends on September 3.

The fire caused $2.5 million in damages officials said.



Investigators released photos of a young boy and a woman who were in the store before the fire. They are asking for the public's help to identify them. Investigators currently view them as witnesses.

They believe the witnesses are a mother and son. The pair arrived at the store just before 5 p.m. in a dark possibly green early model GMC Safari van.

Officials said the fire started around 5 p.m. at the store in the 800 block of South Main Street in Hampstead. The fire quickly spread and took an hour to get under control. Fire departments from Carroll Baltimore and Pennsylvania assisted the Hampstead Volunteer Fire Company.



The Office of the State Fire Marshal said the federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives is assisting with the investigation.



Anyone with information about the fire is asked to contact the Hampstead Police Department or the Office of the State Fire Marshal at 410-386-3050.

TikTok user moneywithmak regularly posts clips sharing tips on how to earn money online.

1 TikTok user moneywithmak said she makes upwards of $1000 per day from Etsy

Mak who runs the account walked through how simple it can be to create an Etsy listing and start generating interest in your products.

In particular Mak advised selling digital products as they don't require you to maintain inventory and can be easily generated.

Popular digital products on Etsy include planners thank you cards logos and schedules.

She said the first step is browsing through erank.com to find trending items you can add to your storefront.

Erank is free to use but does have paid options with more features for more established sellers.

Once you have a digital product in mind she suggested using Canva a free design tool to make your products.

After creating a digital item listing on Etsy Mak recommended adding related key words to the listing to potentially boost its visibility and search engine optimization.

She added that liking your own products or asking friends to like them can help boost your inventory.

In another video about boosting Etsy traffic Mak also said she uses a service called PlaceIt to get high quality mockups and promotional images to use on her storefront.

You can then post these mockups to Pinterest for some free advertising.

Mak said that having quality images to boost your brand with can go a long way toward catching the eyes of potential buyers.

She also said in another video that she uses print on demand to sell some products which can be a profitable and efficent tactic for sellers.

Print on demand allows storefront owners on sites like Etsy to sell products without handling the merchandise themselves.

Sellers who use a print-on-demand fulfillment model can spend more time promoting their brand on social and refining their designs.

Statistics on Etsy sellers

Selling on Etsy can be a very profitable hustle as the platform's top earners rake in more than $65000 annually according to SaleSamurai.

The average Etsy seller generates around $45000 each year but those numbers are skewed by the site's top stores.

Roughly two-thirds of Etsy users earn less than $100 annually according to StatisticBrain.

Etsy also charges 20 cents per product you list on the platform and takes 6.5% of sales as commission.

The tax implications of a side hustle

Whether you work a side hustle in addition to a full-time job or juggle multiple part-time gigs your earnings are taxable.

Not only that but you need to report your earnings from a side hustle or freelance job differently than you report standard income.

A Form 1040 is required for those with multiple sources of income as you have to list all your income on a single form.

In addition you'll need to file a Schedule C and a Form SE to report your self-employment taxes.

If you have multiple streams of income speaking to a tax professional can help you sort out what forms you need to submit and how to properly fill them out.

The additional income may also move your household into a different tax bracket which will impact how much you have to pay the IRS.

Working a side hustle does allow you to claim more exemptions on your taxes however as you can report your expenses for potential tax deductions.

You'll need to have proof of the money you spent on your side hustle though so make sure to keep any relevant receipts for tax season.

The Sun compiled a list of the best 10 money-making side hustles for 2022.

In 2021 the number of Black-owned businesses in the U.S. grew 38% from pre-pandemic numbers‚Äîbecoming the fastest-growing entrepreneurial group according to Bloomberg.

In Baton Rouge the Baton Rouge Metropolitan Black Chamber of Commerce is seeing‚Äîand helping foster‚Äîa similar trend. All over town Black entrepreneurs and professionals continue to open new virtual and bricks-and-mortar businesses at an increasing rate.

The chamber founded in 2018 provides Black professionals and people of color opportunities to build their network and community as well as gain access to funding professional development and financial literacy. It aims to empower business owners to be successful and sustainable.

‚ÄúWe are entering a renaissance era in Baton Rouge‚Äù says executive director Myra N. Richardson. ‚ÄúThere are people under the age of 40 developing property all over town. Baton Rouge is at a moment to pivot.‚Äù

Richardson who also coaches businesses on strategic planning and marketing through her firm Red Torch Consulting became the chamber‚Äôs executive director in January 2022.

In May the organization opened its official headquarters at the ExxonMobil Community Center on Scenic Highway.

‚ÄúOur office is now housed at the ExxonMobil Community Center because they‚Äôre one of the organizations who stepped up and said they want to have a critical role in moving Black and brown businesses forward‚Äù Richardson says. ‚ÄúSo now we‚Äôre able to have programming and we‚Äôre serving businesses every day.‚Äù

Since she became director the chamber has grown by the hundreds surging from 28 to 370 members. She plans to continue widening its network as the organization celebrates its five-year anniversary in 2023.

Even beyond membership growth 2022 has been the organization‚Äôs most active year yet.

It has hosted a community bike ride with Geaux Ride as well as in-person and virtual workshops on taxes financial literacy and the art of marketing for small businesses. And just last month it hosted a business market and festival at the Main Library at Goodwood with vendors live music and food trucks.

This flurry of activity is making an impact.

‚ÄúEngaging building and supporting minority-owned businesses is the key to peace prosperity and progress in our city‚Äù says Mayor Sharon Weston Broome whose administration has aimed to grow small local businesses and increase opportunities for socially and economically disadvantaged groups. ‚ÄúPartners such as the Black Chamber of Commerce are essential to this work.‚Äù

The Chamber‚Äôs online members directory is a resource for those looking to shop support or collaborate with Black-owned businesses.

It features entrepreneurs organizations and companies from all areas. It‚Äôs categorized by business type including advertising and media finance and insurance legal health care transportation real estate and wellness and personal services such as beauty salons childcare and counseling.

‚ÄúEven if you‚Äôre not Black community partners can support the chamber‚Äù Richardson says. ‚ÄúYou can create space for opportunity. I have been counted out for so long in my life. I don‚Äôt want any young person to feel that way. In this organization there‚Äôs a place for everybody.‚Äù

There are many ways to get involved with the Black Chamber of Commerce.

Locals can apply online for a membership as an individual student university church nonprofit or business.

Members have the opportunity to be spotlighted on the organization‚Äôs website and social media included in the online directory get notified about upcoming local events and have their announcements broadcasted to the Black Chamber of Commerce network.

Moving forward Richardson plans to engage with new partners continue fundraising and complete the chamber‚Äôs strategic plan for the future of the Black Chamber of Commerce.

‚ÄúThis is the opportunity for us to stop surviving and start thriving‚Äù Richardson says. ‚ÄúEveryone can have a piece of the pie.‚Äù brmbcc.org

Cameron Smith's defection to LIV Golf means several pros get their PGA Tour cards back. Getty Images

Five weeks ago Justin Lower gave one of the most raw and candid interviews of the PGA Tour season.

The rookie three-putted the 72nd hole at the Wyndham Championship to fall outside the top 125 in the FedEx Cup standings and lose his PGA Tour card for the 2022-2023 season.

Fast forward to this week and even before the conclusion of the Korn Ferry Tour Finals Lower has his card for next season secured ‚Äî and he has LIV Golf to thank for it.

The PGA Tour updated the FedExCup Playoffs and Eligibility Points List to remove six players: Cameron Smith Joaquin Niemann Marc Leishman Anirban Lahiri Harold Varner III and Cameron Tringale who were suspended Friday after teeing it up in LIV Golf‚Äôs Boston Invitational. Each player is playing his first event on the Saudi-backed PGA Tour rival circuit.

Because of the LIV golfers‚Äô removal Lower along with Matt Wallace Austin Smotherman Doc Redman Danny Willett and Kelly Kraft all moved inside the top 125 of Eligibility Points List secured PGA Tour cards and will have full status next season.

Lower and Redman were playing in the Korn Ferry Tour Finals to try and regain their cards and both were inside the coveted top 25 of the finals points list before this week‚Äôs Korn Ferry Tour Championship. Neither teed it up at Victoria National.

Kraft was just outside the top 25 and did play in the Tour Championship but withdrew on Friday upon the suspensions of the LIV defectors after firing an opening round 68. All three players will be dropped from the Korn Ferry Finals as they cannot improve their standing on the eligibility list.

Additionally the PGA Tour announced players will be paid their FedEx Cup bonuses based on the updated Eligibility Points List and not the Official FedEx Cup Standings. Players suspended by the Tour who are no longer on the Eligibility List will receive bonuses based on the Official FedEx Cup Standings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9uZmwvY29tbWFuZGVycy9uZXdzL3dhc2hpbmd0b24tamFja3NvbnZpbGxlLWphZ3VhcnMtd2Vlay1vbmUtZm9vdGJhbGwtaGlzdG9yeS1zZXJpZXMtdXBkYXRl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,History Favors Washington Commanders Over Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 1,"The Washington Commanders season opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars is history in the making.

Of course it's the first game for the Commanders under their new permanent moniker ... but they'll face a team the Washington franchise has had a ton of success against in the past.

The Commanders are 6-1 all-time against the Jags going into Sunday's season opener and have won the last four meetings. The only time the Jags beat the Commanders? The year was 2002. That game a 26-7 thumping against Washington took place in Jacksonville ... meaning the Jaguars are seeking their first-ever win at FedEx Field.

Given the fact the Jaguars began playing in the NFL in 1995 and intra-conference games take place once every four years there haven't been many opportunities for the two teams to face one another.

The last time the two teams played came in 2018. Josh Johnson was the quarterback Adrian Peterson was the starting running back and kicker Dustin Hopkins nailed a game-winning field goal as time expired to give Washington a 16-13 victory.

While history may favor the Commanders against the Jaguars 2022 is a brand new season and a lot has changed between the two teams since their last meeting. And with this being the season opener it only adds to the emphasis of this game being a clean slate for both teams as they trek on through the new season.

Kickoff between the two teams is scheduled for 1 p.m. Sunday.

Toledo‚Äôs All in With the Mud Hens

The Toledo Mud Hens are members of the International League. The Triple-A affiliate of the Detroit Tigers began to play in 1965 at Ned Skeldon Stadium before relocating to Fifth Third Field in 2003. The downtown ballpark revamped the neighborhood that is now called HensVille. Just like many ballparks of its kind it stands out among others in the league.





The MudHens name dates back to 1896 and has been used for a majority of minor league clubs in Toledo until 1953 when new management went with the Glass Sox later shortened to Sox the name for three years. When baseball returned in 1965 the Mud Hens name was properly brought back.

In the 1970s native Jamie Farr commonly wore Mud hens gear on the TV show M*A*S*H that was provided by the team. Having your team showcased on one of the biggest shows of all-time increased awareness among millions of people. Perhaps that is the reason behind The Swamp Shop which offers a cavalcade of team merchandise from old-school t-shirts and caps to current team gear.

FifthThird Field also offers a wraparound concourse several rooftop suite areas and various restaurants and bars available before the game to create a minor league baseball experience that few can rival.





Food & Beverage 4

Fifth Third Field offers an array of typical ballpark food frozen treats and adult beverages. It may not be as outrageous as other AAA ballparks but there is more than enough to satisfy the palate during a Mud Hens game.

Gilhooley Sports Bar and Grill is named after former Hens broadcaster Frank Gilhooley who broadcast games from 1953-2010. There are photos of his career plastered on the walls in a spot that resembles a restaurant. Burgers are grilled in front of the customers and have names such as the ‚ÄúBacHen‚Äù Burger and the Bloomin‚Äô Onion Burger. You can also order an all-beef hot dog or grilled chicken sandwich.

A few other areas include a few more areas for traditional and non-traditional ballpark cuisine. Suds & Wieners offers beer and hot dogs but is home to the mac and cheese dog Polish sausages and the Sudzie Weiner (brat cooked in beer with grilled onions). The Hen & Hound offers chicken tender baskets grilled chicken sandwiches and the Muddy Dog

The latter has chicken tender baskets spicy chicken sandwiches mac and cheese hot dogs brats corn dogs Polish sausages and the Muddy Dog with cheese chili and onions.

Where the ballpark goes above and beyond is in the dessert category. Far Out Funnels is a psychedelic area that offers funnel cake sundaes cookie and cream funnel cakes and the more traditional kind. Frozen usually has long lines serving ice cream in various styles and flavors served in a cone bowl or mini-helmet. They also have frozen cocktails mixed with vodka with flavors ranging from blue raspberry lemon and margarita.

Budweiser and Pepsi products are the drinks of choice at the ballpark. However various kiosks service craft beer from regional breweries: Warped Wing Maumee Bay Platform Saugatuck Columbus Brewing and a little bit further in Atlanta SweetWater. The Holy Toledo patio is an ideal spot for having a beer or frozen drink at the game.





Atmosphere 4





The construction of Fifth Third Field looks like a typical Triple-A ballpark with red brick and gray stone. It blends in well with the surrounding buildings which have been converted into party decks and team store. It might just be the place to have a quintessential minor league experience.

Toledo‚Äôs ballpark does not stand out from the unique interior concourse but it does provide all the essentials fans would want at the ballgame. The concession stands are properly spaced-out there are various kiosks for quick purchases and there are plenty of nods for over three centuries of baseball. Mudonna is the club‚Äôs official mascot and offers plenty of joy for fans of all ages; she even has a giant bobblehead in the right-field corner of the ballpark.

The Roost is a popular seating area incorporated into a century-old brick building with open floor space for groups. The searing provides fans a corner view of the diamond from a few feet above the concourse similar to the porch seating at old Tiger Stadium. Another nice angle is down the right field wall where bar stools and stadium seating are available.

The concourse offers patio suite seating with old-school Astroturf seating a rustic wooden bar sponsored by local breweries and a children‚Äôs play area behind the batter‚Äôs eye. Outside the concourse gates are bronze statues entitled ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Up?‚Äù which features three kids peering through a knothole and ‚ÄúI Got It‚Äù which features three kids going for a fly ball.

The ballpark and the surrounding HensVille establish it from many others in their league. A destination that begins well before the game and perhaps after that offers a variety of activities for families late-night revelers and the random ballpark hunter passing through town.

This includes the small square behind the home plate Moses Fleetwood Walker Square which has also been named for Walker was the first African-American Major League player and played for the Toledo Blue Stockings in 1884.

Neighborhood 4

Fifth Third Field is located in what is dubbed HenVille and it‚Äôs splattered all over the exterior walls of the ballpark. There are various places within a few steps and blocks to grab dinner or a drink before or after the ball game.

Poco Piatti is a Mediterranean restaurant that offers small and large plates. It includes seafood vegetarian and meat dishes along with pizza and salads. Fleetwood‚Äôs Tap Room is a social hall that carries 48 craft beers and smoked items that include chicken ribs and brisket. There is a rooftop bar for large groups.

There are more than enough other areas within walking distance of the ballpark including Home Slice Pizza Fricker‚Äôs The Alleyway Earnest Brew Work Ye Olde Durty Bird and Tony Packo‚Äôs at the Ballpark where one can enjoy a Hungarian-style hot dog and bring home a can of chili at the gift shop.

Perhaps the most exciting part of the neighborhood is Maumee River which offers a riverwalk sculptures a kid‚Äôs splash zone and an outdoor amphitheater. HensVille Park adjacent to Fleetwood‚Äôs at times has children‚Äôs inflatable rides and concerts as well before the game.

Fans 4

Mud Hens fans are among the best in the minor leagues. They are focused on the game and cheer when their club scores a run makes a great play or gets out of a jam. Yes there are many there for the social aspect but crowds are in their seats as well watching the action on the field.

Access 4

The ballpark is downtown and sandwiched between I-75 and the Maumee River. There is plenty of signage directing visitors to the ballpark and it‚Äôs advisable to arrive early to enjoy pre-game activities in HensVille and the surrounding district. Once inside Fifth Third is easily accessible as it offers a wraparound concourse and easy access to concession stands and exits.





Return of Investment 4

A ticket for most games is between $13 and $15 but the prices go up $3 on Friday and Saturday night games. The downtown stadium is surrounded by individual lots and parking garages that cost $10 per car but there are meter parking spots available as well for much less. It is the case on Sundays when all meters are free of charge. The merchandise is abundant and offers various designs for all ages. The food is not as varied but proper for an afternoon or evening at the ballpark.

Extras 3

The Mud Hens earn a point for the downtown setting that has become HensVille. The district offers restaurants bars a riverview park for kids and much more for fans to enjoy before and after the game. The second point is for The Roost a little nook in the right-field corner that provides upper views of the game behind the foul pole. A third point is awarded to The Swamp Shop which offers one of the largest selections of team merchandise in baseball.

Final Thoughts

Fifth Third Field is a wonderful example of a Triple-A ballpark. The history of the club the HensVille setting and the atmosphere make it a great visit when in town or while on a ballpark trip. You would be remiss not to walk away with team gear from the store.

The seven-goal margin of victory also tied for the fifth largest in program history.

The tenacity paid off in the 70minute as sophomore forwardscored her first goal in nearly a year using nifty footwork and a clean finish to thwart the Owls' back line. Finally in the 83minute junior forwardclosed the scoring off another defensive mistake with Lewin stealing the ball in the backfield and finding Penn for the goal.Georgia returns home this week to close out its non-conference schedule with a pair of matches against Sunshine State opponents.

It‚Äôs no secret that northern St. Johns County is experiencing a massive development boom right now.

Over the past decade thousands of single-family and multi-family living units have popped up throughout land that had long sat undeveloped near the county line between southern Duval and northern St. Johns. And with any significant growth in population commercial development soon follows.

Over half a dozen retail center projects have sprung up in the northern St. Johns area. The largest of these projects Durbin Park has been detailed frequently by local publications including our own. We even created a running list of future Durbin Park tenants which became one of our most-viewed articles of all time showing the clear interest in retail growth in the area.

That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve decided to make a dedicated list for all of the other less-mentioned developments that are underway in the northern St. Johns area. We‚Äôve listed what we know so far below and we‚Äôll keep updating the list as new tenants and projects are announced.

Be sure to check back frequently for updates. And if you wish to utilize these lists on your own page please be sure to link back to our original list!

Yusuf Siddiqui the CEO informed the attendees of the Annual State of Renewables Conference 2022. Engro Energy a subsidiary of Engro Fertilizers will contribute to renewable energy production in Pakistan.

‚ÄòWe are setting up the first private sector-run power plant outside the government‚Äôs ambit. The one-gigawatt hybrid power plant (including thermal) will start producing 500 MW in the first phase by the end of 2024 and the remaining 500 MW will start production in 2025 at Jhimpir Sindh.‚Äô

Siddiqui tried to compare electricity production in Pakistan to economies in the world. In Europe and America the government and private corporations are responsible. Private companies provide electricity and supply to the private sector with tax proceeds from the sale to support the government. However that is not the case in Pakistan. Energy production is solely by the government with little to zero participation from the private sector. And this has led to an increase in capacity rates and circular debt in the country.

Nevertheless the government will not decline in electricity production. They are ready to build renewable power plants of 6000MW increasing the goal from a previous 2400MW in Sindh. Alternate Energy Development Board (AEDB) CEO Shah Jahan Mirza mentioned the government‚Äôs plan to publicize a solar installation scheme by next month.

As of July 2022 Pakistan has a total solar and wind capacity of 600 MW and 1985 MW respectively. While renewable energy holds a 5% share in the energy mix the government will increase it to 60% by 2030.

Thermal electricity is a form of energy with a large share of Pakistan‚Äôs energy mix. But it comes at exorbitant fuel costs. There is a global economic disruption coupled with fragile fuel supply chains.

Due to these situations Pakistan cannot continue to rely on imported fuels like coal diesel and RLNG whether in financial or climatic terms. Renewable power plants will harness the full potential of clean energy to provide reliability to Pakistan‚Äôs power generation.

In October 2021 Engro Energy collaborated with the Sindh government on the hybrid plant installation. The Memorandum of Understanding stated that Engro would build the photovoltaic and wind park Sindh Transmission & Dispatch Company (STDC) would set up the transmission network and the Directorate of Alternate Energy (DAE) would provide the land for the project.

During the signing the President of Engro Corporation Ghias Khan stated the benefits of the project.

‚ÄòEngro has always maintained that we aim to solve some of the most pressing issues of Pakistan and our communities. The construction of this renewable energy park is a testament to this vision which will bring up to a 20 percent reduction in electricity cost for industrial consumers stimulate industrial growth in the country and increase the competitiveness of local industries in international markets.‚Äô

During the conference SDPI Executive Director Dr. Abid Qaiyum Suleri mentioned how important it is to produce green energy in these times. He said ‚ÄòThe heavy rainfall and flash floods are a manifestation of climate change. Renewable energy mix can play a crucial role in emission reduction to mitigate these disastrous climatic impacts.‚Äô",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBsZW5nbGlzaC5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA5LzA0L2NoaW5hLXRlc3RzLWl0cy1maXJzdC1zb2xhci1wb3dlcmVkLWRyb25lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China tests its first solar-powered drone,"According to the entity the vehicle is called Qimingxing-50 (Morning Star) it took off this Saturday at 5:50 p.m. local time from the Yulin airport in the northwestern province of Shaanxi; it spent 26 minutes in the air and then landed at 18:16.

The company assured that the vehicle completed the operation without problems and is in good condition.

The drone has six electric motors that work on solar batteries can conduct maneuvers for a long time even at night and reach more than 20 kilometers of altitude.

Its design will allow it to be sent to carry out reconnaissance missions geographic mapping monitoring of forest fires and the atmosphere among other functions.

Observers indicate that it also broadens the path of research and development of new energies and aeronautical engineering.

On 13 May 1982 the south-facing plant supplied electricity to the grid for the first time. The installed output is ten kilowatts which was an extraordinary amount at the time.

The condition colour and output of the solar cells were regularly checked and measured. An examination after 35 years of operation concluded that the cells were showing wear. This included corrosion hot spots as well as cracks in the cells or defects in connection cables. But the majority of the modules still functioned well and still delivered at least 80 per cent of the output over all confirms Mauro Caccivio who heads the photovoltaic laboratory at the Supsi University of Applied Sciences in Ticino.

Electricity was not cheap: ""The price per watt for the Tiso modules was 100 times higher than today and the solar cells were made from the silicon waste of the electronics industry. The Tour de Sol the first race with solar-powered vehicles gave photovoltaics a boost in Switzerland"" Caccivio recounts in an interview with the Swiss magazine Energeia. According to manufacturers such as the Swiss company Megasol the expected lifespan of solar plants is 50 years or longer. Meanwhile Ticino Solare continues to power and power and power. (nhp/mfo)"

The move to bring back the Bronco in its early 70's retro variant was bolder still. Consumers have responded: Bronco sales from August 2021 were up 268% from the same month a year ago.

What's more is consumers are spending big bucks at dealers on Ford Motor Company-backed accessories. From light kits and tube doors to camping tents and kayak carriers outdoor folks are scooping up accessories to the tune of an average of $1700 per vehicle.Accessories for the Bronco have been a significant boon for dealers with their high margins and no lack of supply. While some accessories are OEM many come from other manufacturers such as Yakima roof racks and Warn winches.Steve Olliges owner of Team Ford in Las Vegas told Auto News that he is having such huge success in selling Broncos and accompanying accessories that he believes he could make a living selling only Broncos ad trimmings. His dealership has sold over 700 Broncos since its revival a little more than a year ago. His customers normally spend $4000-$5000 to outfit their off-road toys.Business is so brisk that Olliges is investing $10 million to build a 9000 square-foot (836 square meters) Bronco Barn near his Vegas showroom with plans to build a Bronco-specific showroom next door.Ford states that consumers have purchased over 1 million accessories for their Broncos and other dealers have echoed the success of Team Ford. The company added the Bronco is the company's most accessorized model with a choice of about 240 products with the Bronco Sport leading the way. Buyers of the Bronco Sport spend an average of $800 on accessories equaling the money spent on best-selling F-Series pickups.The most popular products are modular front bumpers winches and off-road lights.The success of the accessory program can be attributed to lessons learned from the failure of a similar program centered around the 2018 Ford Ranger that was plagued with distribution problems and lack of sufficient inventory.You can bet any retro-Bronco you see is not showroom-direct but modified to fit the desires of the person at the wheel.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2h0aW1lcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjgwMDg4LzIwMjIwOTA0L3ZvbHZvLXNhbGVzLWRlY3JlYXNlLXN1cHBseS1wcm9ibGVtcy5odG3SAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy50ZWNodGltZXMuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlcy8yODAwODgvMjAyMjA5MDQvdm9sdm8tc2FsZXMtZGVjcmVhc2Utc3VwcGx5LXByb2JsZW1zLmh0bQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Volvo Cars' Sales Goes Down by 30% for August Followed by the Supply Problems in China,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2h0aW1lcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjgwMDg4LzIwMjIwOTA0L3ZvbHZvLXNhbGVzLWRlY3JlYXNlLXN1cHBseS1wcm9ibGVtcy5odG3SAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy50ZWNodGltZXMuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlcy8yODAwODgvMjAyMjA5MDQvdm9sdm8tc2FsZXMtZGVjcmVhc2Utc3VwcGx5LXByb2JsZW1zLmh0bQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001671090CEB0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2h0aW1lcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjgwMDg4LzIwMjIwOTA0L3ZvbHZvLXNhbGVzLWRlY3JlYXNlLXN1cHBseS1wcm9ibGVtcy5odG3SAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy50ZWNodGltZXMuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlcy8yODAwODgvMjAyMjA5MDQvdm9sdm8tc2FsZXMtZGVjcmVhc2Utc3VwcGx5LXByb2JsZW1zLmh0bQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Twenty-five pros saw dreams realized and jobs won back this week at the Korn Ferry Tour Championship.

The three-event Korn Ferry Tour Finals have come to a close where the top 75 players on the Korn Ferry Tour and the players ranked 126 to 200 on the PGA Tour battled it out for 25 PGA Tour cards for the 2022-23 season which starts in two weeks at the Fortinet Championship in Napa California. This is in addition to the 25 cards already awarded to the top 25 on the Korn Ferry Tour regular season points list.

The top finisher in the combined points list including both the regular season and finals gets full status on the PGA Tour and spots in The Players Championship and U.S. Open for next year. That honor went to Justin Suh who won the season-ending event at Victoria National with a 21-under-par score to vault from 8th to first in the overall standings.

There are two separate Korn Ferry Tour finals points lists:

one which decides the top 25 in Korn Ferry Tour Finals earnings for players ranked 26th through 75th in the Korn Ferry Tour regular season and Nos. 126-200 in the PGA Tour's regular season FedEx Cup points list as well others who qualified for the Korn Ferry Tour finals through medical extensions or non-member FedEx Cup points one which decides the initial PGA Tour priority order for the top 25 players on the Korn Ferry Tour regular season points

The winners of both of those points lists are fully exempt for the season ahead and get a spot in The Players Championship. Justin Suh won the list of Korn Fetty Tour grads and Will Gordon won the Korn Ferry Tour Finals points list so they are the only players NOT subject to the reshuffles in the PGA Tour priority order every six or so events. He is in his own priority order category for the season ahead of the other graduates. Every other player is subject to the reshuffle.

When it comes to determining the priority order in which they get into PGA Tour events the PGA Tour goes in A-B order with the No. 2 earning Korn Ferry Tour regular season graduate getting top spot in that category followed by the No. 2 earning Korn Ferry Tour Finals gradate and so on.

In January 2022 the Tata group rebranded Tata Sky as Tata Play to reflect its business interests growing beyond Direct To Home services and aid further diversification into allied businesses such as OTT and broadband.

Tata Sky commenced operations in 2004 as an 80:20 joint venture between a joint venture between Tata Sons and TFCF Corporation (formerly known as Twenty-First Century Fox Inc.) and now a part of the Walt Disney Company.

In 2008-09 Singabore-based Temasek Holdings picked up a 10 per cent stake in Tata Play from the Tata Group.

Later in FY13 Tata Opportunities Fund and Tata Capital Ltd acquired an equity stake in the company.

In August last year It had been reported that the company was planning to go public.

‚ÄúWork on the IPO had started last year but was put on the back burner for a while as the company undertook a rebranding exercise and the markets too started to look difficult in the early part of the calendar year"" one of the people aware of the development was quoted in a Livemint report as saying.

""However work on the draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) was restarted recently and efforts are in full swing to file the DRHP by end of this month"" the person cited above said.

The IPO is likely to range between $300-400 million at least.

In the proposed IPO investors Temasek and Tata Capital will sell part of their stakes in the company.

The company also plans to raise money for its use from the IPO."

I. Introduction

In the nearly 50-year saga of modern Australian competition law the section relating to the misuse of market power has recently been substantially revised. The revisions include removal of the requirement to establish a nexus between substantial market power and the alleged anti-competitive conduct and the introduction of an effects test as an alternative to proving and anti-competitive purpose. Significant uncertainty now looms large in this area of the law and authoritative judicial interpretations are needed so that businesses can better gauge how far the most recent amendments in 2017 have augmented the legal risks that shape their conduct.

Our early assessment is that there seems to be cause for concern. Unless future jurisprudence proves us wrong it appears that the former defects in Section 46 (‚Äús.46‚Äù) of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (‚ÄúCCA‚Äù) (i.e. the prohibition against ‚Äúmisuse of market power‚Äù) that provoked the 2017 amendments were less troubling than the new problems caused by those revisions. Whereas the previous form of the prohibition was criticized by some for allowing false acquittals as the price of avoiding false convictions the scales may now have been tipped too far to the other side. In this paper we explain why we are cautiously pessimistic.

Section II discusses the former version of s.46 of the CCA. Section III recalls the impact of the so-called Harper review which led to a complete re-write of s.46 in 2017. Section IV tentatively assesses how the 2017 reform may affect outcomes and comments on what appears to be a new period of uncertainty that may dampen investment and desirable competitive conduct.

II. The Vintage Section 46

After a false dawn for competition law in Australia in 1906 and another in 1965 a modern competition statute with meaningful prohibitions was finally adopted in 1974.2 Since then s.46(1) has been revised periodically most recently in 2017. The pre-2017 version provided:

A corporation that has a substantial degree of power in a market shall not take advantage of that power in that or any other market for the purpose of:

eliminating or substantially damaging a competitor of the corporation ‚Ä¶ preventing the entry of a person into that or any other market; or deterring or preventing a person from engaging in competitive conduct in that or any other market.



Two features are worth highlighting. First the phrase ‚Äòshall not take advantage of that power‚Äô was understood to require a causal link between the firm‚Äôs market power and the impugned behavior.3 The requirement of the causal link was relaxed when the High Court suggested that it would suffice to show that market power ‚Äúmaterially facilitated‚Äù the conduct at issue.4 Yet it remained the case that no contravention was established if the factor that enabled the conduct was not a defendant‚Äôs market power but rather its financial power or ‚Äúmaterial and organisational assets.‚Äù5

Second while the above ‚Äúproscribed purposes‚Äù may be relevant to the issue of foreclosure the provision appears to neglect the interests of consumers other than an oblique reference in s.46(c). Later judgments had to clarify that exclusionary conduct only contravenes s.46 if the foreclosure is meaningful to the ‚Äúcompetitive process‚Äù that is to say if it would serve to weaken competitive constraints or keep competitive pressure at bay.6 Consumer interests are thus protected indirectly. Nevertheless the wording of s.46 may have overemphasized the ‚Äúproscribed purposes‚Äù and the impact on particular competitors.7 In the 2003 Boral case where the High Court rejected allegations of predatory pricing Chief Justice Gleeson and Justice Callinan felt obliged to warn that it was ‚Äúdangerous to proceed too quickly from a finding about purpose to a conclusion about taking advantage of market power. Indeed in such a case a process of reasoning that commences with a finding of purpose of eliminating or damaging a competitor and then draws the inference that a firm with the objective must have and be exercising a substantial degree of power in a market is expected to be flawed.‚Äù

The High Court also offered the following observations with regard to the ‚Äútake advantage‚Äù element: ‚Äú[I]f the impugned conduct has a business rationale that is a factor pointing against any finding that conduct constitutes a taking advantage of market power. If a firm with no substantial degree of market power would engage in certain conduct as a matter of commercial judgment it would ordinarily follow that a firm with market power which engages in the same conduct is not taking advantage of that power.‚Äù The latter statement became a basic litmus test with courts focusing on counterfactual market comparisons and where relevant whether the firm had already implemented a practice prior to acquiring substantial market power.8 However uncertainty emerged again when some cases used the phrase could engage instead of would engage or combined or conflated the two9 which may have further restricted the scope of application of s.46.10 Considering the confusion caused by would versus could11 the Australian Parliament in 2008 clarified that the operative word was would thus removing any doubt as to the implicit condition that the hypothetical benchmark firm active on this imagined market should be assumed to be a rational profit-maximiser. The relevant provision added at that time s.46(6A)(c) became moot in 2017 when the legal test for misuse of market power was overhauled.

It is worth noting briefly that both prior to 2017 and still today some forms of potentially exclusionary behavior can also trigger the prohibition against exclusive dealing (including tying conditions).12 At least in unusual circumstances a firm that does not have a substantial degree of market power could still cause a substantial lessening of competition in particular if the market is at the crease between competitive conditions and overly rigid barriers due to a thicket of vertical contracts.13

There was little doubt that the pre-2017 requirement of a causal link between market power and alleged misconduct played a significant role in the formative s.46 jurisprudence though it was softened somewhat by the above-mentioned Section 46(6A).14 Having remodeled s.46 the Parliament has unambiguously deleted that requirement.

III. The Harper Review and the 2017 Reconstruction of Section 46

The ‚Äúroot and branch‚Äù expert review of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 i.e. the Harper Review15 drew much attention. With regard to s.46 and controversially16 the expert panel endorsed a near-total recast of the prohibition. The revised formulation which survived vigorous lobbying by big business17 and was ultimately enshrined in the Act in November 2017 reads in pertinent part:

A corporation that has a substantial degree of power in a market must not engage in conduct that has the purpose or has or is likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in (a) that market; or (b) any other market in which that corporation or a body corporate that is related to that corporation: [supplies or acquires goods or services or is likely to do so].18

Gone are two trademark elements of the old version of this provision: the ‚Äútake advantage‚Äù test and with it the requirement of a causal link between the firm‚Äôs market power and the allegedly unlawful conduct; and the need to match the conduct with one of the ‚Äúproscribed purposes.‚Äù While the amendment is a striking departure from the previous version of Section 46 the ‚Äúsubstantial lessening of competition‚Äù standard had already long been embedded within the other provisions of the Act governing mergers exclusive dealing and (non-cartel) restrictive agreements.

IV. The Effect of the Changes to Section 46: An Early Assessment

It has been nearly five years since the revised s.46 came into force yet the effect of these changes remains uncertain. Only one matter ‚Äî TasPorts19 ‚Äî has reached the court and it is of limited precedential value as it was not fully litigated. In this case Engage Marine (‚ÄúEngage‚Äù) won a contract to provide towage and pilotage services to Grange Resources (‚ÄúGrange‚Äù) at Port Latta in Northwest Tasmania; the contract had previously been held by the incumbent TasPorts. After Grange notified TasPorts that it was going to switch to Engage TasPorts imposed a new port access charge on Grange potentially making use of Engage‚Äôs services uneconomic. The ACCC alleged that the incumbent‚Äôs conduct prevented Engage from servicing the contract and expanding its operations in the relevant market. TasPorts imposed new charges on Engage‚Äôs tugboats thus making it uneconomic for Engage to use TasPorts‚Äô temporary berths while failing to provide long term berths as well. This forced Engage to deploy a temporary offshore mooring outside of another port and prevented deployment of the second tug required under its Grange contract. TasPorts also failed or refused to provide marine pilot training to Engage. As TasPorts admitted these breaches the Federal Court did not adopt a fully considered decision but issued a Declaration giving effect to those admissions on May 5 2021. Under the circumstances this matter provides no insights as to how the Australian courts will interpret the revised s.46.

The lack of a fully litigated case is particularly significant given the nature of the CCA. Compared to statutes such as the Sherman Antitrust Act 189020 which identifies two general forms of conduct and relies on judges to give them meaning the Australian CCA is far more prescriptive. However the revised s.46 is an exception: the provision is now more open-textured and somewhat ambiguous. What is clear as explained above is that s.46 can only apply if a firm possesses substantial market power. The conduct must then be shown to have the purpose and/or effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition. A firm with substantial market power is entitled to defend its market position from aggressive competitors by adding value ‚Äî improving its product and/or reducing its costs ‚Äî but not by engaging in exclusionary conduct that harms the competitive process.

As we have also seen under the revised s.46 it is no longer necessary to show that the conduct involves the use (i.e. the ‚Äútaking advantage‚Äù) of the firm‚Äôs market power. This is significant because previously whether a firm had taken advantage of its market power was generally assessed by whether the relevant conduct would be economically rational absent the firm‚Äôs market power.21 For example a firm with substantial market power might refuse to supply because it would facilitate competition but would not refuse if the market were competitive and the buyer could obtain supply elsewhere. However if the supplier was concerned about the buyer‚Äôs creditworthiness or concerned about the buyer producing low quality products which would tarnish the supplier‚Äôs reputation it would presumably refuse supply even in a competitive market. In the latter circumstance there would have been no contravention under the ‚Äúold‚Äù s.46.

Removal of the ‚Äútake advantage‚Äù requirement from s.46 means that differentiating between anti-competitive conduct and possibly aggressive ‚Äúcompetition on the merits‚Äù now falls to the substantial lessening of competition test. As Kemp points out the provision ‚Äúdoes not expressly permit the dominant firm to raise an efficiency defence or justification for its conduct.‚Äù22 Under the old s.46 conduct that did no more than increase efficiency would likely have been pursued by a firm in a competitive market and it would not have been a taking advantage of market power. That same line of reasoning does not mesh easily with s.46 in its current form.23 Nevertheless as Kemp24 and Williams25 have argued increased efficiency ‚Äî productive allocative and dynamic ‚Äî fuels competition. Consequently if conduct is being assessed to determine whether it substantially lessens competition the extent to which it increases efficiency should be a relevant consideration. On the other hand it is not yet clear how demanding Australian courts will be with regard to efficiency claims under s.46 following the 2017 reform.26

One of the problems with the substantial lessening of competition test that has been highlighted by the concerns about the effectiveness of the mergers provision of the CCA (s.50) is the requirement of evidence regarding the effect of future conduct which satisfies the Evidence Act 1995. In the context of unilateral conduct the challenged practice in some cases may already have occurred and sufficient time may have elapsed to identify its effect. Frequently however this will not be the case: sufficient time will not have passed before the conduct ceases in response to an inquiry by the ACCC and/or because there is the potential for litigation.

Enforcement of competition law involves trade-offs between the risk that pro-competitive conduct will mistakenly be found anticompetitive (Type I error) and the risk that anticompetitive behavior will mistakenly be found not to be so (Type II error). Traditionally the view has been that Type I errors have more adverse effects than Type II errors and so (all else being equal) the priority should be to minimize Type I errors.27 The amendments to s.46 tend toward the opposite view. They broaden the catchment for finding a misuse of market power. Is the provision now too broad? Will it over-reach? In part this depends on the effectiveness of the substantial lessening of competition test in distinguishing pro-competitive conduct from anticompetitive conduct as noted above. However leaving that to one side it also depends on the wording of the section. Consider the following example. Assume that a company with substantial market power seeks to increase its purchases of a necessary input to meet increased demand for its product. It enters into contracts with suppliers including some that supply its competitors. Consequently some competitors may no longer be able to acquire sufficient inputs to continue to operate or they may be uncompetitive because they face increased input costs. Under the old s.46 it might be argued that the company is simply seeking to produce more and maximize its profits: it has not used its market power to engage in exclusionary conduct and it has no anticompetitive purpose. Under the revised s.46 the outcome is less clear. Irrespective of its purpose if the effect of the conduct is to foreclose existing competitors (and likely raise entry barriers) it may well contravene s.46. Such a scenario illustrates a degree of uncertainty for business following the 2017 reform. Much will depend on how the ACCC and ultimately the courts consider that s.46 should be applied.

One way of testing the effect of the changes to s.46 is to assess whether cases that were unsuccessful under the former s.46 would be likely to succeed under the revised s.46. In Rural Press28 the ACCC was successful in proving that a non-compete agreement between two publishers of local subscription newspapers in South Australia would substantially lessen competition in contravention of s.45 the prohibition of anticompetitive agreements. However it was unsuccessful in establishing that a threat by one of the publishers to enter the other‚Äôs territory with a free newspaper would contravene s.46 even though fear that this would occur at the least contributed to entry into the non-compete agreement. The reasoning of the High Court on appeal in relation to the failure under s.46 was that Rural Press could engage in such a threat even in a competitive market that is it did not need market power to do so. With respect perhaps the relevant question was whether Rural Press would have achieved its objective by its threat and whether the conduct would have been profitable had the market been competitive. Under the revised s.46 to succeed in its claim the ACCC would need to establish that the purpose of the threat was to force Waikerie Printing into the non-compete agreement and/or that the threat had that effect which in turn as established in relation to s.45 had the effect of substantially lessening competition.

Pegg carries out a similar assessment in relation to Cement Australia.29 In that case the ACCC was successful in establishing that Cement Australia had engaged in conduct that substantially lessened competition under s.45. The trial judge found that:

[T]he scope of the rights provision was included for a substantial purpose of preventing or discouraging a rival from obtaining access to Tarong and Tarong North raw flyash for processing ‚Ä¶ and to prevent a rival entering the SEQ [South East Queensland] concrete grade flyash market with processed Tarong or Tarong North flyash. Thus a substantial purpose of the formulation and inclusion of [the relevant clauses] was a substantial purpose of substantially lessening competition in each market.30

However the ACCC was unsuccessful in its claim that the conduct ‚Äî entering into contracts to purchase more flyash than it reasonably required ‚Äî was a misuse of market power intended to prevent or deter competition. Pegg sums up the trial judge‚Äôs findings as follows:

While Cement Australia had a substantial degree of power within the cement market and the conduct undertaken by Cement Australia was for the prescribed purposes of locking out competitors the conduct did not involve Cement Australia taking advantage of their market power‚Ä¶ [because] a firm sans market power could have entered into these agreements and therefore‚Ä¶ [His Honour] did not conclude that Cement Australia had taken advantage of its market power.31

As in Rural Press arguably the problem is the way in which the counterfactual is expressed. Leaving that aside considering the court‚Äôs finding that the effect of the contracts was to substantially lessen competition contrary to s.45 it seems likely that if there had been no ‚Äútake advantage‚Äù criterion under s.46 at that time Cement Australia‚Äôs conduct would have breached the latter provision as well.32

A survey by Gilbert & Tobin (2021) of applications and settlements since November 2017 when the revisions to s.46 took effect suggests that the reform may have encouraged private litigation.33 They found that ‚Äúover the last 18 months while no final judgments have been made there have been interim remedies ordered (injunctions against both Facebook and Google) and evidence of at least two commercial settlements.‚Äù34 However various problems still face private litigants particularly as ‚Äú[p]rivate litigation almost always turns ultimately on price.‚Äù35 Past experience indicates that courts are not well equipped to make orders concerning pricing given the complexity of arriving at an effective form of injunctive relief in this context.36 As the authors conclude: ‚Äúfor private litigants the attractiveness of section 46 as a legal claim will depend to a substantial degree on whether Courts can develop a set of remedies that adequately respond to anti-competitive pricing practices.‚Äù37

V. Conclusion

In this paper we have questioned whether the perceived flaws in the drafting of the ‚Äúold‚Äù abuse of dominance provision in Australia have been overcorrected resulting in a perverse ‚Äúcure‚Äù for an exaggerated disease. If the Australian courts do nothing to allay these concerns in particular by interpreting the reformulated s.46 in a supple way that allows for socially beneficial aggressive competition even where it has incidental foreclosure effects yet another redesign may be required. As noted above the public authority has brought only one case so far under the revised s.46 and the matter was not litigated but rather was resolved through judicial approval of an admission of contravention and penalty. The future approach of the Courts in this area of the law thus remains unknown.

3 This contrasts with Article 102 TFEU for example in respect of which there is no formal need to show that an imaginary non-dominant firm would not have engaged in the same conduct. See Case 6-72 Europemballage and Continental Can v. Commission EU:C:1973:22 para 27. On the other hand it is likely (in an exclusionary conduct case) that there must be a logical link between the dominant position and the harm i.e. between the dominant position and effect of the conduct on an otherwise ‚Äúeffective competition structure.‚Äù See Ekaterina Rousseva Rethinking Exclusionary Abuses in EU Competition Law (Hart 2010) 73-79; Renato Nazzini The Foundations of European Union Competition Law and the Objectives and Principles of Article 102 (OUP 2011) 176-178. In other words the (seldom articulated) issue is not on whether a hypothetical non-dominant firm would have engaged in the conduct but whether the same conduct by a non-dominant firm would have had the same anti-competitive effect.

Allan Fels The Australian Controversy over Abuse of Market Power Law in Reconciling Efficiency and Equity: A Global Challenge for Competition Policy 197 208 (Damien Gerard & Ioannis Lianos eds. 2019) (‚ÄúWhile it is true that the High Court has imposed an underlying competition test into s. 46 the fact is that in one case after another it was obvious that judges liked to look very carefully at whether the behaviour breached conditions (a) (b) and (c) in s. 46(1) (those are the provisions that refer to damage to competitors) [‚Ä¶].‚Äù).

8 To dispel doubts the High Court had to clarify that the relevant counterfactual did not call for the heroic assumption of a perfectly competitive market but only a (workably competitive) market where no firm has substantial market power. See Melway supra note 4 paragraph 52.

11 This confusion and its significance have however been downplayed. See Caroline Coops A Fly in the Ointment for the ACCC? Implications of the Cement Australia decision for the interpretation of section 46 23 Aust. J. Comp. & Consumer Law 83 (2015).

12 Given the partial overlap between the scope of s.46 and that of s.47 claims of misuse of market power have commonly been accompanied by parallel allegations of unlawful exclusive dealing under s.47. See e.g. ACCC v. Safeway Stores (No 2) (2003) 119 FCR 339; ACCC v. Baxter Healthcare (2008) 170 FCR 16; ACCC v. Pfizer Australia [2018] FCAFC 78.

13 Contra the arguably overbroad opinion expressed in Ian Harper et al. Competition Policy Review: Final Report 375 (2015) (‚ÄúIt is well accepted that vertical restrictions will not substantially lessen competition unless they are imposed by a corporation with substantial market power.‚Äù).

14 Opinions differed regarding the extent to which s.46(6A) broadened the scope of the ‚Äútake advantage‚Äù test. See Luke Woodward & Matt Rubinstein The use and abuse of section 46 (2016) p.10 https://cdn.brandfolder.io/3RTTK3BV/as/pev81q-9t241k-dovisy/Luke_Woodward-Theuseandmisuseofsection46.pdf. Commenting on the Cement Australia and Pfizer cases the authors emphasize the impact of s.46(6A) stating for example with regard to Pfizer that the Federal Court ‚Äúdid not immunise conduct on the basis that a firm without market power could or would have engaged in similar conduct.‚Äù

15 See Harper et al. supra note 13.

16 See e.g. Woodward & Rubinstein supra note 14 (reforming s.46 amounted to fixing a provision that was not broken or at least was not broken following the addition of interpretive guidance in s.46(6A)).

22 Kemp supra note 10 at 170.

23 Prior to November 2017 authorization that is an exemption granted on the basis that the conduct would result in a net public benefit was not available for behavior constituting a misuse of market power. As this mechanism is now available for s.46 conduct efficiency gains could at least in theory justify such an authorization (provided the conduct has not yet been implemented). However since an application for authorization amounts to an invitation to the regulator by a firm with substantial market power to test claims that the ‚Äòpublic benefit‚Äô would outweigh the ‚Äòpublic detriment‚Äô such applications might prove rare. The incentive to apply may be particularly weak if a firm fears its submission would later be turned against it as an admission of substantial market power. See Kemp supra note 10 at 180.

The consulting firm MWPVL says that the online retail giant is either closing or abandoning plans to open 42 facilities across the country totaling almost 25 million square feet of usable space Bloomberg reported.

The firm says that Amazon has also delayed opening 21 other locations and canceled several European projects mostly in Spain.

""Amazon is a dynamic business and we are constantly exploring new locations"" Amazon spokesperson Maria Boschetti told Fox News Digital. ""We weigh a variety of factors when deciding where to develop future sites to best serve customers. We have dozens of fulfillment centers sortation centers and delivery stations under construction and evolving around the world. It‚Äôs common for us to explore multiple locations simultaneously and adjust timetables based on needs across the network.""

FTC WANTS MORE INFORMATION ON AMAZON'S ONE MEDICAL PURCHASE

The report comes after it was announced the company is closing two delivery stations in Maryland that employ more than 300 people.

Amazon posted its slowest growth rate in more than 20 years in July but ultimately posted better results than expected which caused the stock to jump 12% the New York Times reported.

""Despite continued inflationary pressures in fuel energy and transportation costs we‚Äôre making progress on the more controllable costs we referenced last quarter particularly improving the productivity of our fulfillment network"" Andy Jassy Amazon‚Äôs chief executive said in a statement at the time.

AMAZON SIGNS GREEN HYDROGEN SUPPLY DEAL WITH PLUG POWER

Amazon announced earlier this year that it would begin subleasing some warehouse space as online shopping numbers have been slowing down.

Spokeswoman Alisa Carroll said subleasing allows the company to ""relieve the financial obligations associated with an existing building"" that no longer meets its needs.

According to The Wall Street Journal  Amazon plans to sublease at least 10 million square feet of warehouse capacity and is looking at options to end or renegotiate more of its leases.

The extra space includes facilities in New York New Jersey California and Georgia Bloomberg News reported.

In January 2022 the Tata group rebranded Tata Sky as Tata Play to reflect its business interests growing beyond Direct To Home services and aid further diversification into allied businesses such as OTT and broadband.

Tata Sky commenced operations in 2004 as an 80:20 joint venture between a joint venture between Tata Sons and TFCF Corporation (formerly known as Twenty-First Century Fox Inc.) and now a part of the Walt Disney Company.

In 2008-09 Singabore-based Temasek Holdings picked up a 10 per cent stake in Tata Play from the Tata Group.

Later in FY13 Tata Opportunities Fund and Tata Capital Ltd acquired an equity stake in the company.

In August last year It had been reported that the company was planning to go public.

‚ÄúWork on the IPO had started last year but was put on the back burner for a while as the company undertook a rebranding exercise and the markets too started to look difficult in the early part of the calendar year"" one of the people aware of the development was quoted in a Livemint report as saying.

""However work on the draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) was restarted recently and efforts are in full swing to file the DRHP by end of this month"" the person cited above said.

The IPO is likely to range between $300-400 million at least.

In the proposed IPO investors Temasek and Tata Capital will sell part of their stakes in the company.

The company also plans to raise money for its use from the IPO."

The segregated portfolios holding Vodafone Idea NCDs have received interest from the telecom company pushing up their NAVs by almost 20% on Friday. Side pockets of five schemes hold Vodafone Idea NCDs worth about Rs 1200 crore. These bonds are maturing in September 2023 but give out the annual accrued interest.Till six months ago these segregated portfolios were valued at zero as per Sebi rules. But in March the values were revised from zero to 35% following ‚Äúa series of positive developments around Vodafone Idea Ltd‚Äù. The segregated portfolios were assigned NAVs on 2 March which in turn showed the value in individual portfolios of investors.In the six months since 2 March the segregated portfolios rose smartly 5.84%. On Friday after Rs 148.74 crore interest flowed in the NAVs of the side pockets shot up 20%. The fund house will distribute the amount received among investors by extinguishing proportionate units based on the NAV of 2 September (for units held in physical mode) and 9 September (for units held in demat mode).Given that the portfolios are valued at 35% there is still a lot of upside remaining. If all goes well and Vodafone Idea pays the principle and interest when the bonds mature in September 2023 investors holding these portfolios can expect their holdings to be worth around 180% of their current value.While the developments around Vodafone Idea bonds have made investors sigh in relief there is no update on the other side pockets that hold Yes Bank additional tier-1 bonds. Mutual funds together have some Rs 3400 crore invested in these bonds including Nippon Mutual Fund (Rs 2500 crore) Franklin Templeton (Rs 590 crore) UTI Mutual Fund (Rs 370 crore) and Kotak Mutual Fund (Rs 130 crore).,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5iaXRjb2luLmNvbS9zYW5jdGlvbmVkLXJ1c3NpYW4tYmFuay10ZXN0cy1pbi1hcHAtb3BlcmF0aW9ucy13aXRoLWRpZ2l0YWwtcnVibGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sanctioned Russian Bank Tests In-app Operations With Digital Rubles ‚Äì Finance Bitcoin News,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.bitcoin.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /sanctioned-russian-bank-tests-in-app-operations-with-digital-rubles/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001671094CD90>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5iaXRjb2luLmNvbS9zYW5jdGlvbmVkLXJ1c3NpYW4tYmFuay10ZXN0cy1pbi1hcHAtb3BlcmF0aW9ucy13aXRoLWRpZ2l0YWwtcnVibGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5kdHZwcm9maXQuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3RoZS1tdXR1YWwtZnVuZC1zaG93LWhlcmUtYXJlLWNyaXNpbHMtdG9wLXJhdGVkLXNjaGVtZXPSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5uZHR2cHJvZml0LmNvbS9hbXAvYnVzaW5lc3MvdGhlLW11dHVhbC1mdW5kLXNob3ctaGVyZS1hcmUtY3Jpc2lscy10b3AtcmF0ZWQtc2NoZW1lcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Mutual Fund Show: Here Are Crisils Top-Rated Schemes,"I saw an interesting observation that the HDFC Flexi Cap Fund has climbed rankings quite substantially and the Axis Flexi Cap Fund has gone down quite a bit. Can you tell us about this?

Piyush Gupta: Flexicap as a category allows fund managers to take allocation across different market capitalisation. So there is no restriction in terms of portfolio construction. Now having said that the funds still have a bias or higher allocation towards large caps when you look at this category as a whole.

Now talking about these two particular funds we have seen that HDFC Flexi Cap has seen improvement in the ranking and has gone up from rank three to rank one. Largely the improvement in the ranking has been driven by improvement in the performance. The fund has improved its ranking from two to one in the performance parameter.

While the portfolio-based parameters are still weaker for this fund it is concentrated at company and industry level.

Given the size of the fund the HDFC Flexi Cap Fund also ranks lower on the liquidity parameters. Coming to the performance this particular fund has actually delivered the highest return when we look at different time frames up to one year‚Äìthree months six months nine months one year.

There is highest performance that this particular fund has given within the peer set.

Key drivers for the performance of this fund have been largely the stocks in the PSU segment. These stocks have actually done well in the recent quarter and relatively recent period which has meant that the performance of the fund has gone up during this period.

And these stocks largely belong to sectors like power energy auto and again dominated by PSU stocks which are actually helping it in improving its performance.

At a sector level the fund had lower allocation to I.T. or software which was a weaker performing sector during this period. That has also helped in protecting sort of a downside in the fund.

Coming to Axis we have seen that over a period of time there is a decline in performance of this particular fund or equity funds within the AMC across categories.

When we look at this fund it has slipped from rank three to rank five at an overall level as well as the performance parameter levels.

By design the fund has maintained higher concentration both at the company and at the sector level over a period of time.

What we have seen is that both sector allocation and stock selection has been adverse from the performance perspective which has meant that the fund has seen decline in its performance.

What we also see in this particular fund and Axis funds in general tend to have higher cash allocation. So despite having higher cash allocation in the recent quarter when the markets actually corrected the fund was not able to protect the downside.

So basically the adverse stock selection and sector allocation has contributed to its decline in its performance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5iaXRjb2luLmNvbS9ldmVyc2NhbGUtZm91bmRhdGlvbi1vZmZpY2lhbGx5LWxhdW5jaGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Everscale Foundation Officially Launches ‚Äì Press release Bitcoin News,,,,

Gartner director of the Cities4Forests program at WRI talked about the climate crisis in an interview with EFE at World Water Week 2022 a international conference on water that took place this week in Stockholm (Sweden).

The specialist emphasized the commitment to nature-based solutions (NBS) actions to improve the ecosystem and aimed at resisting climate impacts related to water (such as droughts and floods) and to mitigate warming.

According to Gartner NBS investments are booming especially in Latin America and other regions of the Global South where ‚Äúthe greatest opportunity to deploy nature for a multitude of benefits‚Äù lies as it is in this part of the world that ‚Äúwill see the highest percentage of infrastructure investment over the next two decades.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe decisions we make about how infrastructure is developed‚Äù will make the difference he argued and warned that ‚Äúif we limit ourselves to built systems‚Äù i.e. concrete ‚Äúwe condemn ourselves to a three-degree future‚Äù of warming (compared to pre-industrial levels). That is why in Latin America and the Caribbean there are ‚Äúhundreds of projects most of them relatively small-scale‚Äù he says ‚Äúbut in aggregate they add up to a huge amount of benefit in terms of clean water clean air jobs for local communities‚Äù and other improvements to human and environmental health.

Gartner argued that NBSs are currently the most economically profitable being ‚Äúthe most cost-effective option available‚Äù although it is true that ‚Äúthe longer you wait the more expensive any given solution is and the narrower the window‚Äù to obtain results in time to reverse ecological devastation a challenge that the scientific community estimates will have to be overcome in less than a decade.

When referring to NBSs the expert thinks of two different scales: on the one hand those designed for cities and on the other those for river basins.

Case example: Jakarta

At the urban level he gave the example of Jakarta (Indonesia) a city that WRI has helped to pass new regulations requiring more trees to be planted in the city so that every neighborhood will have a green space ‚Äúwithin walking distance‚Äù by 2030.

If successful the initiative could achieve several things: ‚Äúreduce urban flooding; dramatically clean the air as trees and green spaces act as a filter; and make for a healthier society through outdoor recreation and exercise opportunities‚Äù Gartner said.

Case example: Espirito Santo

At the watershed level the expert referred specifically to the case of Vitoria in the State of Esp√≠rito Santo Brazil.

In the last decade the state has suffered a severe drought that has lowered the average rainwater input by 65% according to official records contributing to a water crisis that has led to water rationing policies and supply cuts.

Last year a study by WRI‚Äôs Brazil team showed that the Esp√≠rito Santo government could gain more from its investments in reserves by backing green infrastructure such as native forests to help keep watersheds healthy.

WRI has just spearheaded the development of a plan that ‚Äúwill lead to the restoration of more than 600000 acres of priority forests around the cities‚Äù in the Brazilian state.

Gartner stressed that this commitment to forest mass will ‚Äúdramatically‚Äù ensure that more water will be available which will translate into ‚Äúmore water security for decades‚Äù at a much lower cost than if they ‚Äúsimply tried to build their way out of the water challenges they face‚Äù with gray infrastructure.

According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection field operation officers at a port of entry in Laredo seized cocaine valued at $4.2 million within a tractor-trailer on Tuesday.

‚ÄúOur frontline officers have displayed an unparalleled commitment to CBP‚Äôs priority border security mission seizing a fourth significant cocaine load in the cargo environment this week‚Äù said Laredo Port of Entry Director Alberto Flores.

Authorities said Tuesday‚Äôs bust was at the World Trade Bridge and involved a tractor-trailer hauling a shipment of plastic ethylene sheets. Officers referred the tractor-trailer for a secondary inspection where 209 packages containing 545 pounds of alleged cocaine were discovered.

The agency said the narcotics had an estimated street value of $4.2 million.

‚ÄúThese seizures illustrate the gravity of the narcotics threat we are facing and the effective application of CBP officer inspections experience resources and technology‚Äù Flores said.

The narcotics were seized and officials said the incident was under further investigation.

The nine-month Ultimate World Cruise is billed as the longest world cruise in history and it will take place aboard Royal Caribbean International‚Äôs 962-foot Serenade of the Seas visiting all seven continents and hitting over 150 destinations in more than 60 countries. Deep inside the ship‚Äôs belly powering it throughout its voyage will be GE technology.

Readers of GE Reports are familiar with this tech: a powerful gas turbine that uses a jet engine (thus their name ‚Äúaeroderivative‚Äù) modified to generate energy. Based on the CF6 engine which powers Air Force One and many Boeing planes this year the aeroderivative turbine ‚Äî GE calls it the LM2500 ‚Äî surpassed 100 million operating hours. These turbines are used all over the world in applications such as mobile power oil and gas and the manufacture of various products. They‚Äôre also helping U.S. utilities to transition away from coal and bring more renewables online. And they even power seagoing vessels ‚Äî including some of the world‚Äôs largest ships.

Among them are the 1132-foot Queen Mary 2 the only remaining true ocean liner in the world which employs two of the turbines working in tandem with diesel generators. Beyond that 40 navies in the world use them on 600 of their ships ‚Äî from Italian aircraft carriers to U.S. Navy destroyers to frigates in the Royal Thai Navy. And Royal Caribbean Group which is not alone among cruise operators uses the engine on eight ships across its Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises cruise lines. Royal Caribbean Group in fact is one of the top global fleet operators of LM2500 gas turbines with 24 turbines total ‚Äî two per ship on its eight ships plus eight spares.

But the Serenade of the Seas is special. The 2490-guest cruise ship first set sail in 2003 ‚Äî with Whoopi Goldberg as its ‚Äúgodmother‚Äù ‚Äî and it‚Äôs sailed through the Caribbean into the Baltic and from Seattle to Alaska. Because of its track record and the onboard experiences it has to offer it was the ship that Royal Caribbean chose for the record-setting voyage.

‚ÄúThe fact that out of all 64 of their ships they‚Äôre choosing this ship to be the flagship vessel for this around-the-world cruise I think that‚Äôs pretty awesome‚Äù says Albert Whiteside an engineer and senior sales manager with GE Power who manages the Royal Caribbean Group account along with Barbara Beck customer service leader.

Until about 2000 diesel engines dominated the cruise industry. The introduction of gas turbines has allowed companies to continue to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur oxide emissions. The turbines also require less engine room space and have comparably lower noise and vibrations for a more pleasant experience for guests and crew members.

This spring Whiteside traveled to the Bahamas to observe an extensive upgrade of the ship‚Äôs control system which runs the Serenade‚Äôs combined-cycle power plant. The culmination of talks that began in 2018 the upgrade project was managed by GE and executed in partnership with GE‚Äôs FieldCore business control systems designer Woodward and energy technology company Bently Nevada. The combined gas turbine and steam turbine integrated electric drive system (COGES) arrangement features two GE LM2500+ gas turbine generators and one steam turbine generator which together provide 59 megawatts for both main ship propulsion and all onboard power generation needs.

Another big reason why cruise companies use these turbines is their reliability. They are operated by advanced control systems that aim to ensure that the ship operates efficiently and safely. ‚ÄúWe love the reliability of GE LM2500+ gas turbines its durable design and low downtime. In case of planned ‚Äî or in rare cases unplanned ‚Äî work we can replace the entire engine in 12 hours‚Äù says Anders Aasen vice president of global marine operations for Royal Caribbean Group. ‚ÄúThis makes it a dream for every engineer on board.‚Äù

The nine-month Ultimate World Cruise is billed as the longest world cruise in history and it will take place aboard Royal Caribbean International‚Äôs 962-foot Serenade of the Seas visiting all seven continents and hitting over 150 destinations in more than 60 countries. Deep inside the ship‚Äôs belly powering it throughout its voyage will be GE technology.

Readers of GE Reports are familiar with this tech: a powerful gas turbine that uses a jet engine (thus their name ‚Äúaeroderivative‚Äù) modified to generate energy. Based on the CF6 engine which powers Air Force One and many Boeing planes this year the aeroderivative turbine ‚Äî GE calls it the LM2500 ‚Äî surpassed 100 million operating hours. These turbines are used all over the world in applications such as mobile power oil and gas and the manufacture of various products. They‚Äôre also helping U.S. utilities to transition away from coal and bring more renewables online. And they even power seagoing vessels ‚Äî including some of the world‚Äôs largest ships.

Among them are the 1132-foot Queen Mary 2 the only remaining true ocean liner in the world which employs two of the turbines working in tandem with diesel generators. Beyond that 40 navies in the world use them on 600 of their ships ‚Äî from Italian aircraft carriers to U.S. Navy destroyers to frigates in the Royal Thai Navy. And Royal Caribbean Group which is not alone among cruise operators uses the engine on eight ships across its Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises cruise lines. Royal Caribbean Group in fact is one of the top global fleet operators of LM2500 gas turbines with 24 turbines total ‚Äî two per ship on its eight ships plus eight spares.

But the Serenade of the Seas is special. The 2490-guest cruise ship first set sail in 2003 ‚Äî with Whoopi Goldberg as its ‚Äúgodmother‚Äù ‚Äî and it‚Äôs sailed through the Caribbean into the Baltic and from Seattle to Alaska. Because of its track record and the onboard experiences it has to offer it was the ship that Royal Caribbean chose for the record-setting voyage.

‚ÄúThe fact that out of all 64 of their ships they‚Äôre choosing this ship to be the flagship vessel for this around-the-world cruise I think that‚Äôs pretty awesome‚Äù says Albert Whiteside an engineer and senior sales manager with GE Power who manages the Royal Caribbean Group account along with Barbara Beck customer service leader.

Until about 2000 diesel engines dominated the cruise industry. The introduction of gas turbines has allowed companies to continue to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur oxide emissions. The turbines also require less engine room space and have comparably lower noise and vibrations for a more pleasant experience for guests and crew members.

This spring Whiteside traveled to the Bahamas to observe an extensive upgrade of the ship‚Äôs control system which runs the Serenade‚Äôs combined-cycle power plant. The culmination of talks that began in 2018 the upgrade project was managed by GE and executed in partnership with GE‚Äôs FieldCore business control systems designer Woodward and energy technology company Bently Nevada. The combined gas turbine and steam turbine integrated electric drive system (COGES) arrangement features two GE LM2500+ gas turbine generators and one steam turbine generator which together provide 59 megawatts for both main ship propulsion and all onboard power generation needs.

Jason M. Allen was almost too nervous to enter his first art competition. Now his award-winning image is sparking controversy about whether art can be generated by a computer and what exactly it means to be an artist.

In August Allen a game designer who lives in Pueblo West Colorado won first place in the emerging artist division‚Äôs ‚Äúdigital arts/digitally-manipulated photography‚Äù category at the Colorado State Fair Fine Arts Competition. His winning image titled ‚ÄúTh√©√¢tre D‚Äôop√©ra Spatial‚Äù (French for ‚ÄúSpace Opera Theater‚Äù) was made with Midjourney ‚Äî an artificial intelligence system that can produce detailed images when fed written prompts. A $300 prize accompanied his win.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fascinated by this imagery. I love it. And it think everyone should see it‚Äù Allen 39 told CNN Business in an interview on Friday.

In August Jason M. Allen's piece ""Th√©√¢tre D'op√©ra Spatial"" ‚Äî which he created with AI image generator Midjourney ‚Äî won first place in the emerging artist division's ""digital arts/digitally-manipulated photography"" category at the Colorado State Fair Fine Arts Competition. Courtesy Jason M. Allen

Allen‚Äôs winning image looks like a bright surreal cross between a Renaissance and steampunk painting. It‚Äôs one of three such images he entered in the competition. In total 11 people entered 18 pieces of art in the same category in the emerging artist division.

The definition for the category in which Allen competed states that digital art refers to works that use ‚Äúdigital technology as part of the creative or presentation process.‚Äù Allen stated that Midjourney was used to create his image when he entered the contest he said.

Midjourney is one of a growing number of such AI image generators ‚Äî others include Google Research‚Äôs Imagen and OpenAI‚Äôs DALL-E 2. Anyone can use Midjourney via Discord while DALL-E 2 requires an invitation and Imagen has not been opened up to users outside Google.

The newness of these tools how they‚Äôre used to produce images and in some cases the gatekeeping for access to some of the most powerful ones has led to debates about whether they can truly make art or assist humans in making art.

This came into sharp focus for Allen not long after his win. Allen had posted excitedly about his win on Midjourney‚Äôs Discord server on August 25 along with pictures of his three entries; it went viral on Twitter days later with many artists angered by Allen‚Äôs win because of his use of AI to create the image as a story by Vice‚Äôs Motherboard reported earlier this week.

‚ÄúThis sucks for the exact same reason we don‚Äôt let robots participate in the Olympics‚Äù one Twitter user wrote.

‚ÄúThis is the literal definition of ‚Äòpressed a few buttons to make a digital art piece‚Äô‚Äù another Tweeted. ‚ÄúAI artwork is the ‚Äòbanana taped to the wall‚Äô of the digital world now.‚Äù

Yet while Allen didn‚Äôt use a paintbrush to create his winning piece there was plenty of work involved he said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre just smashing words together and winning competitions‚Äù he said.

You can feed a phrase like ‚Äúan oil painting of an angry strawberry‚Äù to Midjourney and receive several images from the AI system within seconds but Allen‚Äôs process wasn‚Äôt that simple. To get the final three images he entered in the competition he said took more than 80 hours.

First he said he played around with phrasing that led Midjourney to generate images of women in frilly dresses and space helmets ‚Äî he was trying to mash up Victorian-style costuming with space themes he said. Over time with many slight tweaks to his written prompt (such as to adjust lighting and color harmony) he created 900 iterations of what led to his final three images. He cleaned up those three images in Photoshop such as by giving one of the female figures in his winning image a head with wavy dark hair after Midjourney had rendered her headless. Then he ran the images through another software program called Gigapixel AI that can improve resolution and had the images printed on canvas at a local print shop.

Allen is glad the debate over whether AI can be used to make art is capturing so much attention.

‚ÄúRather than hating on the technology or the people behind it we need to recognize that it‚Äôs a powerful tool and use it for good so we can all move forward rather than sulking about it‚Äù Allen said.

Cal Duran an artist and art teacher who was one of the judges for the competition said that while Allen‚Äôs piece included a mention of Midjourney he didn‚Äôt realize that it was generated by AI when judging it. Still he sticks by his decision to award it first place in its category he said calling it a ‚Äúbeautiful piece‚Äù.

‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs a lot involved in this piece and I think the AI technology may give more opportunities to people who may not find themselves artists in the conventional way‚Äù he said.

Allen won‚Äôt yet say what the text prompt was behind his winning image ‚Äî he‚Äôs planning to keep it a secret until he publishes a larger related work that he hopes will be finished later this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVub3IuY29tL21lZGlhL25ld3Nyb29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL3RlbGVub3ItYXNpYS1kaWdpdGFsLWxpdmVzLWRlY29kZWQtbGl2ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Telenor Asia Study Reveals 5 Key Trends for Continued Surge,"People across Asia are united by a firm belief that connectivity empowers them with more economic opportunity daily convenience and greater access to essential services according to Telenor Asia‚Äôs new ‚ÄúDigital Lives Decoded‚Äù study.

They see it as an app used by old people and an app that is full of conspiracy theories then TikTok also made its debut and stole away the hearts of youngsters but according to new data posted by Data.ai in the US the most used social media app by Gen Z is Facebook based on monthly user data.That should be surprising right? It isn't.Why? Because in the second list of the chart apps like Reddit Instagram TikTok and Snapchat are more likely to be used by Gen Z as compared to the overall population of the United States but according to data Gen Z is regularly logging into apps like Facebook and Messenger.According to Data.ai themselves users from ages 18-29 have self-reported that they have turned away from using social media but all other apps that track usage have had their usage time increased.However it should be noted that data.ai's revelations are purely based on actual usage which shows that around the world the younger generation instead of becoming less active has become more active on social media. This clears that younger users are not inching away from social media at all. There is also one more point of note here and that is data.ai's collection is completely from Android phones and no iOS phones were reviewed. This makes their data a bit segregated but it is enough to provide a general insight into the usage patterns of the younger generation.The chart above which shows Monthly Active Users does not in any way account for the time spent on one app. so if someone just logs into the app for a couple of minutes only to check on family and friend updates will be included in the official charts. This is a major key point that many often overlook and is the reason why MUA charts are now not widely used as a measure of engagement.While Gen Z does often engage more frequently in their favorite social media apps than others it is not always the best for the actual time spent on the app. As a matter of fact in both Germany and the US Gen Xers spent 25% more time on social media than Gen Z.Read next: The most hated and annoying mobile apps in the world,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzNmMGVjNTRkLTE1YjEtNDk3NC04ZDVkLTU3NGYwODc4OGVmNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Generation Z wants from a business masters,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzNmMGVjNTRkLTE1YjEtNDk3NC04ZDVkLTU3NGYwODc4OGVmNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000167127F8610>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzNmMGVjNTRkLTE1YjEtNDk3NC04ZDVkLTU3NGYwODc4OGVmNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

McPhail Obituary","Robert ‚ÄúBob‚Äù Brown McPhail passed away peacefully at his home in Norwich CT on August 25 2022. He was born in New London CT on March 10 1931 the oldest child of the late Mary (Brown) McPhail and Alexander McPhail. His 91 years of life were filled with conscientious work numerous friendships sports community service and love for his family.

Bob as he preferred to be called was raised in New London and was always proud to say so. He attended the C. B. Jennings Elementary School and graduated high school in 1949 from the former Bulkeley School where he was the class salutatorian and quarterback of the football team. During summers when not pulling pranks on his siblings and friends he was a lifeguard at Ocean Beach Park along with his brother Norman and several close friends. He always looked forward to reminiscing with his Bulkeley classmates every August at the school‚Äôs annual reunion.

Bob attended Amherst College on an academic scholarship but after a couple years his education was interrupted by his service in the United States Coast Guard during the Korean War. After concluding his military service Bob continued his education at the University of Connecticut and graduated in 1957 with high honors in business administration. He also later earned his master‚Äôs degree in education from the University of Connecticut.

Soon after graduating from UConn Bob married Jane Novak on June 22 1957 and the couple moved to Ludlow MA when he took a job at the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company. Their first child Cynara was born there in 1958. Shortly after the family headed back to Bob‚Äôs hometown of New London when he became employed by General Dynamics/Electric Boat Division. It was there that they welcomed their second child Marlin in 1959. The family then soon moved to Norwich the city Bob would call home for the remainder of his life. He worked for General Dynamics for 11 years in data processing management and for a short time with The Computer Services Group before making a move to the teaching profession.

In 1969 Bob was encouraged by Charles Hamblen the principal at Norwich Free Academy to go into teaching and was hired by Hamblen to develop a computer technology curriculum at the school. Once at NFA he never left. In addition to his teaching duties Bob quickly got involved with athletics at the school. He was an assistant coach for the football and basketball teams and in 1972 he also became the head coach of the golf team. His year-round coaching roles ended in 1981 when he was appointed the Athletic Director at NFA. He served in that capacity until 1993 when he also retired from teaching but this allowed him to return to coaching the boys golf team in 1994. He continued coaching the boys until 2016 when he was 85 years old. Bob also started the girls golf program at NFA and coached the girls for eight years. He enjoyed travelling with the boys and girls to matches all over the state and he tallied over 700 wins between the two teams. He was founder and director of the Wildcat Invitational Golf Tournament an annual state high school golf event and the Wildcat Scramble an annual fund-raising tournament to provide financial aid for college-bound students who competed in the Eastern Connecticut Conference (ECC). He served as secretary and treasurer of the ECC for over 20 years.

Along the way Bob picked up many honors including Electric Boat Outstanding Intramural Athlete Electric Boat Athletic Hall of Fame Norwich Sportsman of the Year in 1972 the Connecticut High School Coaches Association Outstanding Coach in Golf for 1977 NFA Sports Hall of Fame Norwich Sports Hall of Fame and he was named the 2016 Boys Golf Coach of the Year by the National High School Coaches Association.

Bob took a great interest in his children‚Äôs activities and was actively involved in Norwich youth sports. He was on the Board of Directors for the Norwich Little League and Norwich Midget Football League and he was Sports Director for the Norwich Rose Arts Festival. He loved to travel and watch his son Marlin play baseball. He and Jane would frequently take off on weekends to watch Marlin play at Cornell University and they later made many trips across the country to see him play and coach professionally. Bob was also quick to volunteer when his daughter Cynara needed a patient to help complete her requirements at the UConn School of Dental Medicine which required him to make multiple visits to Farmington and sit for hours at a time. He also made sure to attend many of his grandchildren‚Äôs activities including baseball games soccer games track and cross country meets and dance recitals.

Bob was an avid golfer and an active member of the Pautipaug Country Club and the Norwich Golf Club. He was also a member of the Norwich Rotary Club and Norwich Elks Club. In the early 1980s he initiated fantasy football and baseball leagues with colleagues and friends before fantasy leagues became popular. A fierce competitor he enjoyed the friendly bantering with his opponents and often took home the bragging rights of a winner. He loved photography and throughout his life took thousands of photos of teams players nature and family. Bob also enjoyed gardening and took pride in the vegetables he grew but he never seemed to produce enough cucumbers for Jane‚Äôs pickles. Bob was also a longtime loyal fan of UConn Women‚Äôs Basketball; he attended games since the early 1990s had season tickets for over twenty years and traveled to numerous Final Fours.

Bob is survived by Jane his beloved wife of 65 years and their children Dr. Cynara McPhail (Jon Kornacki) and Marlin McPhail (Terry) his cherished grandchildren who referred to him as Pa Amanda Smith (Alex) Sarah Kornacki Ryan McPhail (Brooke) and Daniel Kornacki and four adorable great-granddaughters Camden McPhail Addison Smith Emerson McPhail and Eliza Smith. Bob is also survived by his nephew Michael Kettlety (Michelle) and niece Geralyn McPhail. He was predeceased by his brother Norman McPhail his sister Barbara Pingalore and his niece Norma Jean McPhail Logan.

Funeral arrangements are under the direction of Woyasz and Son Funeral Home 141 Central Avenue Norwich. There will be no calling hours and burial will be private.

These are part of a much larger series of incidents around US warships and destroyers recorded in ship logs and other United States Navy (USN) personnel testimonies reported by The Drive last year.

The EurAsian Times had written about US fighter pilots and military servicemen revealing their radars and communications jammed while detecting or tracking abnormally moving UAPs.

These incidents have become subjects of major Congressional inquiries. Officials from the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of the Navy have also appeared before lawmakers and indirectly hinted about their helplessness and the sensationalist implications based on the ‚Äúinexplicability‚Äù and ‚Äúinconclusiveness‚Äù of their probes.

Moreover any possible Russia or China hand in the incidents would have instantly been officially alleged by the US military or political leadership ‚Äì or both. It would be hard to imagine the US giving up such an opportunity to show its rivals in a bad light especially when relations are at their worst.

UAPs ‚ÄòHarass‚Äô Zumwalt ‚Äì Video

The incident occurred on April 24 2019 at 8:30 pm Pacific Time around 17 nautical miles from the US Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton in international waters.

The Zumwalt had reported as many as six UAS operating at nearby altitudes ranging between 300 and 1000 feet. At one point the UAS crossed over the Zumwalt‚Äôs deck. Other incidents with other US warships had been recorded by their own Ship Nautical or Otherwise Photographic Interpretation and Exploitation Team (SNOOPIE) team of sailors.

The video released shows the incident to have occurred at night and is quite hazy and heavily pixelated. It would be far-fetched not to assume the Zumwalt‚Äôs onboard sensors did not detect anything worthwhile.

However those findings would mostly be protected from public scrutiny under the FOIA as militarily or strategically sensitive information much like the Right to Information (RTI) Act.

The clearer part of the video shows a set of several lights appearing to be white and green in a rectangular formation. One of the sailors is even heard saying that the UAS does not appear to be armed.

The narration by the sailor describes them as ‚Äúflying consistent patterns northwest east south without alteration of course speed and altitude.‚Äù The video ends with the sailor saying that ‚Äúno weapons were observed.‚Äù

What adds more intrigue to the issue is Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Admiral Mike Gilday telling journalists in April 2021 that they had not yet ‚Äúpositively identified‚Äù the UAS/UAP. The Department of Defense (DoD) had in August 2020 created the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF).

The UAPTF is led by the Department of the Navy and overseen by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security.

The drones over Zumwalt however don‚Äôt appear to be otherworldly based on experts The Drive report quoted. One unnamed drone industry analyst said he couldn‚Äôt find anything on the drones in the footage that couldn‚Äôt be purchased off-the-shelf.

He also pointed to the narrator‚Äôs observation about the fixed flight pattern with no changes in altitude meaning the drones were pre-programmed to fly a specific route.

This would make sense for an adversary spying on an advanced US defense platform since full and continuous remote human control with an active radio link makes the drone vulnerable to Radio Frequency (RF) jamming.

A reason for the Zumwalt to not react is the fear of falling into a trap where it is forced to reveal its radar and electronic frequencies disclosing valuable Signals Intelligence (SIGINT).

Documentary Films & Congressional Hearings

Interestingly Ronald S Moultrie the current Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security requested a closed-door hearing when questioned during a Congressional Committee chaired by Congressman Andre Carlson.

While Gilday in the April 2021 media interaction denied the extra-terrestrial possibility saying he ‚Äúhas no indications at all of that‚Äù Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence Scott Bray had admitted some sightings that US officials ‚Äújust can‚Äôt explain.‚Äù

Some of the most famous footage shows UAP/UFOs moving seamlessly between the sea and the air. The US submarines reported detecting objects moving at unprecedented speeds and maneuverability beyond human-made craft.

For instance pilots over the years having spotted hazy-looking UAVs say that being incredibly fast-moving and nimble objects should still have essential aerodynamic characteristics like having some form of propulsion/exhaust and latent kinetic energy.

The objects are shown moving without any thrust at speeds nearly at Mach 1.5 and suddenly changing direction stopping on a dime or accelerating in a way that looks like it is just shooting ahead.

‚ÄúThere are a small handful of cases in which we have more data than our analysis simply hasn‚Äôt been able to fully pull together a picture of what happened‚Äù adding that the UFO/UAPs had ‚Äúunexpected flight characteristics‚Äù Bray said before Congress.

The videos combine the Navy‚Äôs radar screens and thermal and infrared recordings from the electro-optical tracking systems (EOTS) aboard US Navy warships helicopters reconnaissance aircraft and fighter jets.

The issue garnered international attention after releasing the 2004 footage captured by Commander Chad Underwood now known as the ‚Äútic-tac‚Äù drone event. Underwood reported several strobe lines on his radar screen which he later said were ‚Äújam lines‚Äù to Corbell. Underwood also replies in the affirmative when asked if his radar was going awry after detecting the ‚Äòtic tac‚Äô UFO/UAP as an ‚Äúindication of an active jamming.‚Äù

‚ÄúOnce I got the target of interest on my radar I took a ‚Äòlock‚Äô and that‚Äôs when all the funky things started happening. The erratic nature of the ‚Äòtic tac‚Äô the airspeed was telling to me. Then we started seeing jam ‚Äòstrobe lines.‚Äô Strobe lines are vertical lines that show up on your radar indicating that you are being jammed‚Äù he noted.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aGV0aW1lcy10cmlidW5lL25hbWUvYW50aG9ueS1tYW5jdXNvLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM2NDEwNDE50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Anthony Mancuso Obituary (2022) - Jessup PA - Scranton Times,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/thetimes-tribune/name/anthony-mancuso-obituary?id=36410419 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aGV0aW1lcy10cmlidW5lL25hbWUvYW50aG9ueS1tYW5jdXNvLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM2NDEwNDE50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

The increase in capacity would bring total employment at the Wellston facility to over 1000 full-time employees.

‚ÄúGeneral Mills has been a cornerstone of this community for more than 35 years and our employees exude a lot of pride in making food the world loves‚Äù Stephanie Weaver plant manager at General Mills‚Äô Wellston facility said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre excited to grow our business and employee base in southeastern Ohio and having strong local regional and state partners has been instrumental in our success.‚Äù

Totino‚Äôs originated in 1951 as a family pizza parlor in Minneapolis Minnesota. Today it‚Äôs grown to make more than 300 million party pizzas every year.

‚ÄúAs one of the most recognized food brands around the world General Mills continues to grow and thrive in Ohio‚Äù J.P. Nauseef president and CEO JobsOhio said. ‚ÄúThe expansion of the Totino‚Äôs facility in Wellston and the addition of 30 new jobs for hardworking Ohioans demonstrates the ongoing success that global companies can establish in Ohio.‚Äù

The expansion is being supported by a tax credit from the Ohio Department of Development and a $400000 JobsOhio Grant in collaboration with OhioSE toward the building machinery and equipment costs.

‚ÄúThis is a tremendous win for Jackson County‚Äù Mike Jacoby OhioSE President said. ‚ÄúGeneral Mills‚Äô investment in Wellston is yet another success story on the benefits of doing business in southern Ohio. The growth tied to this project will contribute to the long-term future of this plant and our region‚Äôs food manufacturing industry.‚Äù

General Mills is one of several food manufacturers that call Jackson County home.

The county‚Äôs food manufacturing workforce is more than 2500 strong and the county possesses roughly three percent of the nation‚Äôs frozen-food workforce.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2RidXNpbmVzc25ld3MubmV0L2FydGljbGVzLzIwODcxLXNsaWRlc2hvdy1uZXctcHJvZHVjdHMtZnJvbS1uYXR1cmFsLXByb2R1Y3RzLWV4cG8td2VzdC1zaG930gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Slideshow: New products from Natural Products Expo West show,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.foodbusinessnews.net', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/20871-slideshow-new-products-from-natural-products-expo-west-show (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000167120B7970>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2RidXNpbmVzc25ld3MubmV0L2FydGljbGVzLzIwODcxLXNsaWRlc2hvdy1uZXctcHJvZHVjdHMtZnJvbS1uYXR1cmFsLXByb2R1Y3RzLWV4cG8td2VzdC1zaG930gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vdmludGFnZW1vdG9yc3BvcnQuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMDkvZHVlc2VuYmVyZy1jYWRpbGxhYy1kcGktc2VsZWN0ZWQtYmVzdC1pbi1zaG93LWF0LTI3dGgtYW5udWFsLXRoZS1hbWVsaWEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Duesenberg Cadillac DPi Selected Best In Show at 27th Annual The Amelia,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='vintagemotorsport.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/03/09/duesenberg-cadillac-dpi-selected-best-in-show-at-27th-annual-the-amelia/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000167120B6A70>, 'Connection to vintagemotorsport.com timed out.

Coca-Cola Co. McDonald‚Äôs Corp. Starbucks Corp. and Yum! Brands Inc. to the growing list of companies suspending some operations in Russia over that country‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.

Ramon Laguarta chief executive officer of PepsiCo Inc. Purchase NY said in an email to employees on March 8 that the company would suspend the sale of beverages like Pepsi Cola 7UP and Mirinda as well as capital investments and all advertising in Russia.

‚ÄúAs a food and beverage company now more than ever we must stay true to the humanitarian aspect of our business‚Äù Mr. Laguarta wrote. ‚ÄúThat means we have a responsibility to continue to offer our other products in Russia including daily essentials such as milk and other dairy offerings baby formula and baby food. By continuing to operate we will also continue to support the livelihoods of our 20000 Russian associates and the 40000 Russian agricultural workers in our supply chain as they face significant challenges and uncertainty ahead.‚Äù

Mr. Laguarta added that PepsiCo has suspended operations in Ukraine and is working to provide aid to Ukrainian refugees in neighboring countries through donations to aid agencies and the ramping up of production at other PepsiCo manufacturing plants in Europe.

The Coca-Cola Co. Atlanta released a brief statement March 8 that it was ‚Äúsuspending its businesses‚Äù in Russia but did not provide details.

McDonald‚Äôs temporarily will close all its restaurants in Russia and pause all operations in that market according to an email sent March 8 by Chris Kempczinski CEO to employees and franchises.

On the same day Kevin Johnson president and CEO of Starbucks wrote employees saying the company was suspending all business activity in Russia. The company has approximately 130 locations in the country.

‚ÄúOur licensed partner has agreed to immediately pause store operations and will provide support to the nearly 2000 partners in Russia who depend on Starbucks for their livelihood‚Äù he wrote.

Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine also drew a reaction from Yum! Brands. The owner of the KFC Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands suspended all investment and restaurant development in Russia.

In Russia McDonald‚Äôs at the end of 2021 had 847 restaurants with 84% operated by the company. The chain had 108 in Ukraine all operated by the company. The two countries accounted for 2% of McDonald‚Äôs systemwide sales in 2021.

‚ÄúWe understand the impact this will have on our Russian colleagues and partners which is why we are prepared to support all three legs of the stool in Ukraine and Russia‚Äù Mr. Kempczinski said of restaurants closing in Russia. ‚ÄúThis includes salary continuation for all McDonald‚Äôs employees in Russia.‚Äù

Chicago-based McDonald‚Äôs also is paying full salaries to Ukrainian employees has donated $5 million to an employee assistance fund and is supporting relief efforts by the International Red Cross.

‚ÄúAcross the rest of Europe we will stay focused on how McDonald‚Äôs can best help those in need both now and in the future‚Äù Mr. Kempczinski said. ‚ÄúWe have already seen extraordinary leadership by our Ukrainian and Russian teams and I know the rest of the McDonald‚Äôs system stands ready to support the large number of refugees who have been displaced by this conflict.

‚ÄúAs we move forward McDonald‚Äôs will continue to assess the situation and determine if any additional measures are required. At this juncture it‚Äôs impossible to predict when we might be able to reopen our restaurants in Russia. We are experiencing disruptions to our supply chain along with other operational impacts. We will also closely monitor the humanitarian situation.‚Äù

Louisville Ky.-based Yum! has about 1000 KFC restaurants and 50 Pizza Hut locations in Russia. Independent operators run nearly all the restaurants under license or franchise agreements. Yum! is donating $1 million to the Red Cross is activating a disaster relief fund to support Ukrainian franchise employees and is matching donations from employees to charities providing relief in Ukraine.

‚ÄúMcDonald‚Äôs and other fast-food outlets are under pressure to withdraw from the Russian market‚Äù said Ramsey Baghdadi a consumer analyst for GlobalData March 8. ‚ÄúHowever this is easier said than done for the fast-food industry. Russia represents approximately 0.7% of the global fast-food restaurant‚Äôs value in 2020. Such a small proportion of value generation in Russia tells us that fears of losing sales is not the main factor at play here.

‚ÄúThe challenge that foodservice providers have is the very nature of their business model. Fast-food chains such as McDonald‚Äôs and KFC often have complicated agreements with their outlets as a large proportion of them are franchises and are not enterprises. So it becomes a much more challenging negotiation to completely stop operations compared to other industries.‚Äù

A GlobalData consumer survey released in March showed consumer concern for social causes however.

‚ÄúAs 72% of consumer purchases are driven by a brand‚Äôs ethics or support shown toward a social cause it becomes difficult for these companies to balance consumer expectations and their operational needs putting pressure on international fast-food restaurants‚Äù Mr. Baghdadi said."

EV

This move falls in line with the previous statements General Motors made back in June about their plan to go completely electric by 2030. Global Vice President of Buick and GMC Duncan Aldred said in a recent interview that in total there are 2000 Buick franchise dealers in the United States. All of them will be offered a buyout for the brand.Once this offer is accepted the respective dealer will no longer have the official rights to sell the Buick brand. Aldred also stated that nearly every dealer that sells Buicks has at least one other GM brand in their portfolio. However this will not affect their business with other such models he mentioned The VP did not go into details about how many dealerships are currently willing to take the deal. But we could form a general idea based on the similarities between this scenario and the one with the Cadillac buyouts completed not even a year ago.Cadillac Global Vice President Rory Harvey publicly stated that 315 Caddy dealerships in the U.S. took the $200000 offer whereas the remaining 560 dealers chose the opposite.If you‚Äôre wondering why some of them would take the offer whereas others won‚Äôt it mainly boils down to a simple investment choice. On one hand electric cars require less maintenance than conventional-fueled cars. This would be one incentive for a dealership to sell EVs.On the other hand the upgrades for the infrastructure required don‚Äôt come cheap. Charging stations aside there‚Äôs the matter of the cables running through the building itself. In some extreme cases the interior space could become a veritable construction site that would be off-limits to the general public and hurt the business in more than one way.As to when this offer will be made VP Duncan Aldred did not mention. However Buick has plans to launch its first currently named the Buick Wildcat EV Concept in 2024. That could mean that phones might be ringing off their hooks sooner rather than later.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndmbWouY29tL3N0b3J5LzQ3MjEyMDExL3ZhbGxleS1uYXRpdmUtcmV0aXJlZC1ib3hlci1lYXJuaWUtc2hhdmVycy1kZWFkLWF0LTc40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Reports: Valley native retired boxer Earnie Shavers dead at 78,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNocmV2ZXBvcnR0aW1lcy5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy9zcHQwODIwNjLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,George E. Carney Obituary,"George Everette Carney 84 died in Milam Texas on Wednesday August 31 2022. George was born March 17 1938 in Shreveport Louisiana to Clarence and Annie Lee Carney. George is survived by his wife of 64 years Frances Scalco Carney. George and Frances married on September 8 1958. George is also survived by his children Valarie Sikes and husband Jim and Chris Carney and wife Angela; his grandchildren Matthew Sikes Patrick Sikes Reece Carney Ashley Zipf and Zachary Coutee; his sister Mildred Bearden; and devoted friends Charles and Karen Haggard. He was also blessed with many great-grandchildren. He is predeceased by a sister Nettie Lee Carney and a great-grandchild James Camden Sikes. After graduating from Fair Park High School in Shreveport he joined the Shreveport Fire Department in 1957. He was passionate about firefighting and truly loved his job. George rose in the ranks to eventually become the Chief Training Officer. He helped shape the lives of many men who later achieved great accomplishments in life. When General Motors Truck and Bus started building the plant in Shreveport they sought him out for his expert Fire and Safety knowledge. He retired from the Fire Department and worked at General Motors for 22 years. He turned down multiple opportunities to work in other General Motors locations so he could stay close to his family and friends in Shreveport. He was a dedicated family man who always provided for his family. After retirement he found lake front property on Toledo Bend Lake and built a beautiful retirement home. He lived there until his passing. George was always busy with some sort of project or hobby. At the lake he made many friends who helped him complete his projects. Like his father before him he was a beekeeper. Many a person enjoyed the sweet honey his bees produced. He also enjoyed gardening hunting and fishing. He served on the board of the G-M Water Supply Corporation in Hemphill Texas for many years and helped them develop and maintain their water system. George never accepted a half effort from himself or anyone that he worked with or supervised. His famous saying was ‚ÄúIf something is worth doing you might as well do it right the first time‚Äù and he generally wanted that done ‚ÄúToday!‚Äù. He successfully ‚Äúdid it right‚Äù when it came to supporting his family providing them a spring board to become who they are today. His legacy of being proud of a job well done and working hard will be felt by many family members and friends for many years to come. Funeral services will be held at 1:00 p.m. on Wednesday September 7 2022 at Rose Neath Funeral Home 1815 Marshall Street Shreveport Louisiana. Visitation will be from 11:00 a.m. until 1:00 p.m. preceding the funeral service. Burial will be at St. Joseph‚Äôs Cemetery on Texas Street in Shreveport Louisiana. Honoring George as pallbearers will be Matthew Sikes Patrick Sikes Bill Bailey James Evans Dr. Ricky Davidson Chief Dan Cotten Terry McDonald and Joel Valenzuela. The family suggests memorials may be made to St. Jude Children‚Äôs Research Hospital 501 St. Jude Place Memphis TN 38105 or another charity as an expression of sympathy instead of flowers. The family would also like to extend a special thanks to Affinity Hospice for their kindness during George‚Äôs extended illness. A firefighter never dies; he just burns forever in the hearts of those that love him. Rest easy Chief you ran a good race and your work is done here.

Labor Day in Atlanta can only mean one thing: Atlanta Black Gay Pride Weekend!





Atlanta Black Pride is acclaimed as the largest black gay pride weekend across the United

States heralding approximately 250000 persons into the city across the events throughout the 5 days of the ‚Äòweekend‚Äô.





As we get ready for one of the most epic weekends in the city Gaye Magazine caught up with philanthropist promoter and ‚Äúserial entrepreneur‚Äù (as she likes to call herself) Melissa Scott. As the co-founder of the Pure Heat Community Festival and a managing partner of Atlanta Black Pride we wanted to get all the details about one of the largest LGBTQ+ gatherings in the country.

Scott comes from humble beginnings in Augusta and was raised in Baltimore before making her way to Georgia. Scott is a well-known party promoter in Atlanta and dee-jays under the name DJ M.





In 2018 Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms even named Melissa Scott a board member of the city‚Äôs LGBTQ Advisory Board. In describing herself Scott considers herself a ‚ÄúType A OCD motivator‚Äù.





In 2022 Atlanta Black Gay Pride celebrates its 26th year and the Pure Heat Community Festival celebrates its 10th year in Atlanta. Scott tells us that the Pure Heat Community Festival simply started as an idea to rent a pavilion at Piedmont Park during Black Pride Weekend and give away free water. Something that was intended as a small idea grew into something much much larger.

With DJ Rick spinning on the ones and twos in their rented pavilion Scott revealed that they expected about 400 people to show up and receive the free water they were giving out that weekend. Instead over 10000 people arrived at the space they occupied and therein lies the beginnings of one of the most recognized events during Atlanta Black Pride weekend.

When asked what Scott appreciates most about identifying as a member of the LGBTQIA+ community she tells us that ‚Äúit is what it is.‚Äù But what resonates with her most is the support that the city of Atlanta provides to the members of the community. Scott tells us that she comes from a time when she almost lost her basketball scholarship in college due to being openly lesbian.





As such she says that she appreciates the constant vigilance that the city pays to our queer community stating that if there is an issue within our community there is no brushing it under the rug.





‚ÄúThe city itself is an ally.‚Äù

Being a DJ and promoter Melissa Scott often finds herself in communal social settings which is where she thrives. Through community she has found herself meeting different kinds of people who offer a kaleidoscope of personalities and come from a melting pot of various circumstances.





Scott says that this is where a lot of her outreach and philanthropic intentions began. She stated that social environments can act as ‚Äúmedicine for some people‚Äù and so she became more interested in being a part of the solution as opposed to seeing people ‚Äúself-medicating‚Äù in order to survive.

Through this realization Melissa Scott found herself drawn toward more outreach programs involving LGBTQIA youth. Upon realizing that a lot of the youth that she found herself interacting with were in fact homeless Scott discovered that she wanted to find ways to help homeless LGBTQ youth before they got to the point of homelessness.

This year‚Äôs Pure Heat Community Festival will also double as the inaugural year for the Pure Heat Community Youth Festival. The youth festival is geared toward members of the LGBTQIA+ community that are between the ages of 14-24 years old and promises to be just as outstanding as its forefather. The youth festival will also have an area of its own along with its own vendors and entertainment.





Creating an inclusive event of this magnitude has been no easy feat for Melissa Scott and her team however. She lets us know that the festival is entirely free and as a queer woman of color she has had her share of navigating obstacles in order to bring the Pure Heat Community Festival to new levels.





‚ÄúI can say LGBTQIA all day but what that looks like from a corporate standpoint is gay white men‚Ä¶ You know this is a festival a free festival for people who love the LGBTQIA community and people who just love people. And so the biggest challenge coming into this was funding.‚Äù





Scott states that in trying to receive sponsorship for the Pure Heat Community Festival organizations would reject the proposal stating that they were already sponsoring other (universal) Pride events. Atlanta Black Pride brings over 40 million dollars in revenue to the city over 5 days.

Despite this however Scott tells us that it‚Äôs been a constant and enduring endeavor for the festival to receive the recognition and notoriety it rightfully deserves. She continues to say that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre getting there‚Äù stating that Gilead Sciences and Ace Healthcare Foundation came on as sponsors this year and are the reason that they will be able to launch the youth aspect of the Pure Heat Community Festival.





Scott tells us that one of the many reasons the organization has been pushing to generate income from the festival is to fund some of the outreach programs for the Vision Community Foundation. The Vision Community is a sister organization that hopes to ‚Äúimpact and transform the minority LGBTQI+ community through outreach awareness and prevention.





The Pure Heat Community Festival that takes place during Atlanta Black Pride Weekend has come a long way from its humble beginnings in a pavilion at Piedmont Park. The festival over the years has seen the likes of Nicki Minaj Monica Tiny and Da Brat and BB Judy. Scott makes mention that the year that Nicki Minaj came to Atlanta Black Pride happens to be one of her fondest memories in the festival‚Äôs history.





The festival was set to take place not too long after her partner and co-founder of the Pure Heat Community Festival Durand Robinson was murdered and Scott states that she was feeling very unmotivated and saddened by his passing.





In what some may call ‚Äúperfect timing‚Äù Scott turned the radio on in her car to hear Nicki Minaj stating that she was ‚Äúready to shut the city down for Atlanta Black Pride Weekend‚Äù. And the superstar did indeed make good on her promise.

Pure Heat Community Festival Founder Melissa Scott and Juju James

Scott disclosed that what makes her feel the most prideful as the weekend rolls around every year is the joy that she sees from the patrons that turn up for the festival.





‚ÄúIn the midst of the event if you look out everyone is smiling for no reason.‚Äù





She says that is reason enough to push her to do more and more each year for the festival.





The Atlanta Black Pride will kick off on Thursday September 1 2022 and run through to Monday September 5 2022. Scott's annual Pure Heat Community Festival at Piedmont Park will take place Sunday and will host approximately 25 events including a brunch block party and nightly events. There will even be resources available for COVID and Monkeypox testing as well as vaccinations for both respectively.





Atlanta Black Pride Weekend promises to continue its exemplary legacy this upcoming weekend with a host of epic events iconic influencers and fabulous celebrities. The celebration of Pride in any form is a nod to the beautiful spectrum of sexual identities that exist and their narratives.





So Gayes be sure to show up and show out for our city at Atlanta Black Pride! Let‚Äôs continue to show the world how much Pride we really have!

According to the study the less use of cash among Kenyan businesses is reflected in the high preference for mobile wallets (56 per cent) compared to Nigeria (14 per cent) and South Africa (7 per cent).

The study also highlighted that high usage of digital payments in Kenya was concentrated in food entertainment tours and accommodation agriculture transport and delivery and professional services sectors of the economy.

‚ÄúCash is the highest used option across all markets though relatively lower in Kenya. Mobile wallet payments are highest in usage as well as preference in Kenya. Usage of a personal account for business payment is also prevalent in Kenya. Bank transfer is widely used in Nigeria‚Äù the survey stated.

It added that 69 per cent of Kenyan businesses said digital payments (mobile money transfer card payment contactless cards and bank transfer) have positively impacted their business as they can easily track expenses and revenues enabling fast transactions and cutting on errors in change.

The adoption of mobile money payments in Kenya has been rising following the Central Bank‚Äôs push for the service in recent times. Last year during the pandemic the Kenyan government released a directive through the central bank instructing commercial banks and payment service providers to stop charges on all transfers from mobile money wallets and bank accounts.

According to Visa the impact of introducing digital payments for businesses is positive but the study shows room for improvement in adoption. The survey concluded that 83 per cent of respondents that adopted digital payments experienced an improvement in revenue. At the same time 55 per cent of business owners plan to increase investment in new technologies.

Fraud attempts in Africa have increased by more than 50% in the last two years according to a report

Meanwhile a new report has revealed that fraud attempts in Africa have increased by 50% in the last two years. The report published by popular KYC service Smile Identity found that the first half of 2022 alone saw a 30% increase over 2021.

According to the report there had been an increase in fraud attempts in countries like Kenya while a reduction was observed in Ghana and South Africa.

‚ÄúIn 2020 17% of all Smile Identity KYC checks were flagged as attempted fraud and in the first half of 2022 this number increased to 26%. For the foreseeable future as businesses adapt to the new virtual reality we expect to see more and new types of fraud emerge increasingly‚Äù the report stated.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vaXR3ZWIuYWZyaWNhL2NvbnRlbnQvbExuMTRNbVFqZEJNSjZBYdIBMWh0dHBzOi8vaXR3ZWIuYWZyaWNhL2FtcC9jb250ZW50L2xMbjE0TW1RamRCTUo2QWE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google Pay ready to compete for slice of SA‚Äôs bustling Fintech market,"Mobile payment service Google Pay has gone live in South Africa enabling in-app online and in-person contactless payments from Android mobile phones tablets or connected watches.

The development is expected to bump up tap-and-pay transactions in South Africa with global payments switch service MasterCard powering up Google Pay payments.

Google Pay enables users to transact with a virtual card number or token which according to Google means that a user‚Äôs financial information is kept safe.

Users of the new platform store their cards for Google Pay within Google Wallet a digital wallet that also recently launched in South Africa.

South Africa is considered a major market for contactless payments and according to MasterCard‚Äôs New Payments Index 52% of South African consumers have used smartphone and digital tap-and-pay platforms in the past year.

MasterCard stated: ‚ÄúThis trend is set to continue with 60% of South African respondents saying they are likely to tap a smartphone to pay in the coming year with comfort and security key to growing adoption.‚Äù

Alistair Mokoena South Africa manager for Google said ‚ÄúAccess to technology is vital for economic prosperity as millions of people use their mobile devices daily to tap-and-pay at stores pay for public transportation and to utilise a variety of passes. We want to make digital wallets accessible to everyone through fast secure access to their everyday essentials.‚Äù

Gabriel Swanepoel Southern Africa manager at MasterCard added: ‚ÄúWe are excited to work with Google to deliver a payment experience that is both simple and secure in turn speeding the adoption of digital payments in South Africa. We understand that consumers want to make digital payments when where and how they want.‚Äù

The South African market has also attracted Apple Pay while a host of banks offer similar transactions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcmVtaXVtdGltZXNuZy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYnVzaW5lc3MtbmV3cy81NTIzMDgtbmlnZXJpYS10by1wYXktNDk2LW1pbGxpb24tdG8tc2V0dGxlLWluZGlhbi1maXJtcy1jbGFpbS1vdmVyLWFqYW9rdXRhLXN0ZWVsLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nigeria to pay $496 million to settle Indian firm's claim over Ajaokuta steel,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.premiumtimesng.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /business/business-news/552308-nigeria-to-pay-496-million-to-settle-indian-firms-claim-over-ajaokuta-steel.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000167110FAB00>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcmVtaXVtdGltZXNuZy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYnVzaW5lc3MtbmV3cy81NTIzMDgtbmlnZXJpYS10by1wYXktNDk2LW1pbGxpb24tdG8tc2V0dGxlLWluZGlhbi1maXJtcy1jbGFpbS1vdmVyLWFqYW9rdXRhLXN0ZWVsLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Voices and Orchestra Edusei ‚Äì a thrilling fiercely rational Beethoven 9,"This is of course not just one of Beethoven‚Äôs most famous works it is one of his most famously difficult; Donald Tovey called it ‚Äúa law unto itself‚Äù while musicologist Nicholas Cook has written eloquently on its ‚Äúdiametrically opposed interpretations‚Äù. After its first shambolic performances during Beethoven‚Äôs lifetime it took decades for its reputation to recover ‚Äì now it‚Äôs so familiar the challenge is to deliver an account that feels as deftly original as it is authoritative.

The symphony also of course bears the scars of the ideological battles that have been fought over it throughout the generations. Now the ""Ode to Joy"" is the European Union‚Äôs anthem. Yet the Nazis‚Äô attempt to appropriate it remains infamous and it‚Äôs perhaps even more relevant to the Chineke! interpretation that the rulers of the former apartheid regime of Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) also claimed it as their own in the Seventies. Within seven short years the Chineke! Orchestra has established such a reputation for the dynamism and quality of its performances that it‚Äôs difficult to remember when it was a rarity to see black and ethnically diverse performers in mainstream classical venues. Yet even in an apparently much more tolerant society than the brutal Zimbabwe/Rhodesia regime we have a lot of catching up to do and to hear this orchestra give this mesmerising account of Beethoven 9 feels in its own way like a turning point.

German/Ghanaian conductor Kevin John Edusai has carved out a reputation for identifying the architecture of each piece he conducts and revealing it in all its shimmering articulated glory. Beethoven 9 is at certain points so formally experimental that the danger is for it to sound chaotic and muddy. Here however there was never any sense of stumbling intent ‚Äì if there was a criticism it was that sometimes it sounded almost too efficient. Yet that crystalline clarity really paid off especially in the third movement where it was possible to hear influences ranging from Beethoven‚Äôs own ""Path√©tique"" sonata to Mozart‚Äôs Serenade for 13 Wind Instruments.

The evening opened with a performance of George Walker‚Äôs Lilacs which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1996. This setting of Walt Whitman‚Äôs elegy in memory of Abraham Lincoln forms an interesting textual companion to Schiller‚Äôs Ode to Joy; both take profound political emotions and elevate them into an expression of the sublime. The performance introduced the celebrated American soprano Nicole Cabell (pictured above on the left) whose ravishing sonorous voice swooped in counterpoint to Walker‚Äôs shivering jagged orchestration. It was an arresting opening to an evening that would prove as notable for its musical elegance as its richness.

After the agile account of Beethoven‚Äôs first movement which built to thunderstorm intensity in the final bars the orchestra moved to a tightly controlled molto vivace. This is the movement in which Beethoven the revolutionary painted with silence as much as with noise and Edusai‚Äôs rigorous definition paid off handsomely here. The melodic use of the drums ‚Äì which would inspire composers from Berlioz to Stravinsky ‚Äì was effectively and quite literally highlighted by placing the drummer separately from the rest of the percussion above the orchestra (pictured below). The tenterhook spikiness of the strings was offset by the rich lyricism of the woodwind passages. As with the first movement there were moments when it felt a little too exact a little more about the rationalism of the Enlightenment than the thrilling insights. Yet in the third movement any doubts fell away. In this extraordinary adagio there were moments when it almost felt as if you were being given a window into Beethoven‚Äôs mind watching the different musical ideas unfurl and interact. What could have come across as diffuse and fragmented was instead revealed as a rich mosaic of sound from a man burning to express the complexity of his world.

Like an actor grappling with ""To be or not to be"" in the fourth movement the musicians must spend as much time avoiding clich√© as excavating nuance and this sophisticated interpretation did just that. Edusai built up the layers like a geometric puzzle so the themes glittered and refracted. Bass-baritone Ryan Speedo Green delivered a compelling opening to the dialogue before the choir Chineke! Voices made the Royal Albert Hall dome and auditorium resonate with the iconic harmonies. The deceptively effortless reach of Cabell‚Äôs voice made its mark here with assured support from mezzo Raehann Bryce Davis and tenor Zwakele Tshabalala.

There were some fragile moments ‚Äì including a couple of bars where the sopranos sounded slightly sharp ‚Äì yet ultimately this performance demonstrated the stupendousness of Beethoven‚Äôs achievement: the fight between rationality and madness the multiplicity of musical ideas the reaching from a stormily imperfect world into a more exalted dimension. Cook talked about the symphony being ""a construction of mirrors reflecting and refracting the values hopes and fears of those who seek to understand and explain it"". At a time of epic geopolitical and climatic turbulence last night Edusai revealed it yet again as a symphony for our times.",,,,,,,,,

By Paul Palmer

The new season brings many changes to this year‚Äôs Hall High football team. They will now be known as the Titans after the West Hartford Board of Education voted in June on new nicknames at Hall and Conard eliminating any remaining association with Native American imagery.

On the field coach Frank Robinson is dealing with a young group of players having lost 27 seniors from last year‚Äôs 9-2 team that made it to the Class LL Quarterfinals.

The 2022 edition of the Titans returns fewer than 10 starters from last year‚Äôs team and faces one of the toughest schedules the team has had in years. They open with Fairfield Ludlowe at home this Thursday but then go on the road at Southington Ridgefield and Maloney. ‚ÄúIt is one of the most challenging schedules in my tenure‚Äù said Robinson now in his 17th season.

On the offensive side of the ball junior Bode Smith will be the starting quarterback replacing departed senior Elijah Salomons. His coach says that while Smith did get some reps last year in games he will be learning as he goes.

Another big hold that will need to be filled is at running back. With the departure of All-State Leo Perreira who is now at Franklin Pierce College Hall needs to find a way to replace his nearly 1200 hundred rushing yards and 21 touchdowns from a season ago. The team does return senior wide receiver Angelo Culmo who had 452 yards and 6 touchdowns last season.

Robinson believes the success will start upfront with some of his returning players. ‚ÄúOur returning lineman Max Jewett and others it will be huge that they perform. If we can run the ball like we did last year we can be in games.‚Äù

Senior nose guard Eric Diaz and linebacker Hudson Hollander will anchor the defense along with Grant Kanaga. ‚ÄúWe have to be ready from the get-go‚Äù Robinson said . ‚ÄúThe expectation is we need to be ready to go.‚Äù

Robinson also knows that losing 27 seniors means losing team leaders but he believes the spirit is already there. ‚ÄúWe have leadership from our seniors and we need them all to do it. It oozes down to the juniors from there‚Äù said Robinson.

It is a tough task replacing all the lost leaders and seniors from a season ago and Robinson knows that one of the keys will be setting the right attitude early. ‚ÄúThe success last year didn‚Äôt just happen. They worked their tails off and did not cut any corners. This year we can‚Äôt think we will be good just because we were last year.‚Äù

Chocolate maker creates scare,"Children and candy lovers received a scare over the summer when news broke that there might be more tricks than treats this Halloween season but thanks to a steady sugar industry and the apparent changing tones of a chocolatier the holiday might be able to occur uninterrupted after all.

During a July earnings call Hershey CEO Michele Buck told company leaders that the candymaker might not have been able to meet consumer demand through the busy fall season.

""Seasonal consumer engagement is expected to remain high and we expect high single-digit sales growth for both our Halloween and Holiday seasons. Despite this strong growth we will not be able to fully meet consumer demand due to capacity constraints"" Buck said.

The news of the possibility that Hershey‚Äôs Reese‚Äôs Twizzlers and other popular brands may not greet some trick-or-treaters at doorsteps went worldwide.

The thought of a Halloween without an endless supply of candy was scarier than some haunted houses but some industry insiders cautioned the news might be less dire than the company‚Äôs original remarks.

US SEES FIRST FALL COLORS OF 2022 FOLIAGE SEASON

Despite questions on the availability of the season's candy a spokesperson for America's largest sugar producers assured FOX Weather that if there are production shortages they won't be created from a lack of the essential ingredient.

The growing of sugarbeets and sugarcane is highly dependent on the weather but the American Sugar Alliance said recent extreme events have not significantly impacted production.

""Despite some challenges such as drought in Texas where sugarcane is grown and late planting of sugarbeets in the upper Midwest due to cold and wet weather this year‚Äôs crop is looking good and is currently forecast to be larger than last year. Ultimately we won‚Äôt know what the final crop will be until all the harvests are completed"" said Rob Johansson director of economics & policy analysis at the American Sugar Alliance.

Drought Tracker





With more than 60 percent of the country facing drought conditions farmers of various crops and livestock have been hard hit but most of the main production belts for sugar have escaped drastic impacts.

The U.S. is one of the world‚Äôs largest sugar producers with sugarcane accounting for around 45 percent of domestic sugar and sugarbeets leading to 55 percent of production according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Experts say sugarcane grows in climates that are more tropical and are a commonly found along the Gulf Coast while sugarbeets tend to do better in a more temperate climate with less rainfall and cooler air.

HOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHER ON TV

With no apparent issues with sugar production what caused Hershey to ring the alarm?

Well we may never know but recent statements by the company are positive for trick-or-treaters. Last month the candy company clarified its remarks and said there should be product for everyone.

""We actually have even more seasonal product available to the consumer this year than last year"" a Hershey spokesperson told FOX TV Stations.

The National Retail Federation estimates around $3 billion is spent every year on confectionary treats for the October holiday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL2tlYXJuZXlodWIuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9sb2NhbC9iaWctZmluaXNoLXRvLWZpcnN0LWhhbGYtaGVscHMta2Vhcm5leS1jYXRob2xpYy1lYXJuLWltcHJlc3NpdmUtd2luLW92ZXItaGVyc2hleS9hcnRpY2xlXzU5YmEyYjA2LTJiM2MtMTFlZC1iZWNmLWM3OTNlNDdlYTM2NS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Big finish to first-half helps Kearney Catholic earn impressive win over Hershey,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL2tlYXJuZXlodWIuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9sb2NhbC9iaWctZmluaXNoLXRvLWZpcnN0LWhhbGYtaGVscHMta2Vhcm5leS1jYXRob2xpYy1lYXJuLWltcHJlc3NpdmUtd2luLW92ZXItaGVyc2hleS9hcnRpY2xlXzU5YmEyYjA2LTJiM2MtMTFlZC1iZWNmLWM3OTNlNDdlYTM2NS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016712C22BF0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL2tlYXJuZXlodWIuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9sb2NhbC9iaWctZmluaXNoLXRvLWZpcnN0LWhhbGYtaGVscHMta2Vhcm5leS1jYXRob2xpYy1lYXJuLWltcHJlc3NpdmUtd2luLW92ZXItaGVyc2hleS9hcnRpY2xlXzU5YmEyYjA2LTJiM2MtMTFlZC1iZWNmLWM3OTNlNDdlYTM2NS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL2RyZXhlbC5lZHUvbWVkaWNpbmUvYWNhZGVtaWNzL2dyYWR1YXRlLXNjaG9vbC9odW1hbi1sYWN0YXRpb24tY29uc3VsdGFudC1jZXJ0aWZpY2F0aW9uL3N0dWRlbnRzLWFuZC1hbHVtbmkvcmViZWNjYS13YWxrZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet Beckie Walker: Drexel Human Lactation Consultant Certification Alum -
