India is planning laws that would boost competition and lower debt at its power distribution companies but also risks fomenting anger in a country where electricity is often used as an election sweetener.Key proposals include allowing more utilities to operate within the same circles mandating regulators to set tariffs based on market costs and defining payment procedures and deadlines according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified as the details aren’t yet public. The bill will be presented to parliament in the current session that runs through Aug. 12.Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s government says the overhaul is essential to unclog a sector that is key to its energy transition ambitions but is choked with $75 billion of debt. Critics say the amendments pave the way for big companies to take over the sector as richer customers would switch to private firms leaving state-run utilities with users who rely on subsidies.“The day the bill is presented in the parliament power industry employees around the country will go on a strike” said Shailendra Dubey chairman at the All India Power Engineers Federation an advocacy body that produces energy policy suggestions. “This amendment only allows private companies to benefit from the states’ distribution networks and cherry-pick profitable distribution circles.”A representative for the Power Ministry didn’t immediately respond to an email outside of business hours Friday. The bill asks regulators to set a ceiling and a floor tariff in areas where two or more suppliers are present in a single distribution circle.The matter is contentious because several state governments promise free electricity to lure voters. Politicians then press regulators to prescribe artificially low tariffs or local administrations fail to transfer subsidies; money-losing retailers delay payments to power generators grid operators and coal suppliers weakening the entire supply chain.Modi last week said unpaid bills amounted to nearly 2.5 trillion rupees and urged states to clear the dues. State governments say the subsidies protect poor citizens and small businesses.“Electricity is an essential commodity which needs to be regulated and managed and cannot be given up to the greed of profit” said Avik Saha secretary of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee a farmers’ lobby that has been opposing the bill for months. He said farmers would protest if the bill is pushed through.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkvY29pbWJhdG9yZS93aW5kLWZhcm1zLXNldC1yZWNvcmQtZm9yLXBvd2VyLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24vYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTM0MDI1MDcuY21z0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vY2l0eS9jb2ltYmF0b3JlL3dpbmQtZmFybXMtc2V0LXJlY29yZC1mb3ItcG93ZXItcHJvZHVjdGlvbi9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTM0MDI1MDcuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wind farms set record for power production,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkvY29pbWJhdG9yZS93aW5kLWZhcm1zLXNldC1yZWNvcmQtZm9yLXBvd2VyLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24vYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTM0MDI1MDcuY21z0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vY2l0eS9jb2ltYmF0b3JlL3dpbmQtZmFybXMtc2V0LXJlY29yZC1mb3ItcG93ZXItcHJvZHVjdGlvbi9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTM0MDI1MDcuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D849490F0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkvY29pbWJhdG9yZS93aW5kLWZhcm1zLXNldC1yZWNvcmQtZm9yLXBvd2VyLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24vYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTM0MDI1MDcuY21z0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vY2l0eS9jb2ltYmF0b3JlL3dpbmQtZmFybXMtc2V0LXJlY29yZC1mb3ItcG93ZXItcHJvZHVjdGlvbi9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTM0MDI1MDcuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,

A chartered flight carrying the original trophy which will tour Bangladesh from 8-11 June landed at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport at around 11.25 am.

The trophy tour has been accompanied by a seven-member FIFA delegation including French 1998 World Cup winner Christian Karembeu. Officials of Coca Cola and BFF led by the BFF president Kazi Mohammad Salahuddin received the trophy from the airport.

During the tour of Bangladesh the trophy will be taken to the President's residence the Bangabhaban at 4pm and the residence of the Prime Minister the Ganabhaban at 7 pm.

After the two high profile courtesy meetings Coca Cola Bangladesh will host a dinner for specific invited guests on Tuesday night.

On the following day (Wednesday) a cultural programme will be held as the trophy will be displayed at the Army Stadium for the public. People will also have opportunities to take photos with the trophy.

The global tour of the world's most coveted trophy started on May 12 with a first-stop event in Dubai.

Hinch has a chance to teach a baseball history lesson he takes it.

And so Friday afternoon he sat in the clubhouse with his pitchers — Tyler Alexander Jason Foley Tarik Skubal and Will Vest — talking about the weekend's upcoming ceremony.

He realized they knew Lou Whitaker but didn't know Lou Whitaker.

So he gave them an assignment: Grab your phones he instructed pull up Alan Trammell on one and Whitaker on the other.

""The reason I did it is because we hold Alan Trammell in such reverence because he’s active (in the organization) he’s here with us he instructs us I mean there’s always a smile on our face when he comes around"" Hinch said. ""Lou has not been around but he was just Alan Trammell at a different position.

""I mean if you look at his offensive profile the five-time All-Star the Gold Gloves the Rookie of the Year (in 1978) — just to open the eyes of our players on what Lou meant to this franchise.""

'THAT DAY WILL COME':As Detroit Tigers hail Lou Whitaker he's ready for Hall of Fame nod

CELEBRATING GREATNESS:Reliving Lou Whitaker's greatest games with the Detroit Tigers before number retirement

The thousands of fans who lined the streets prior to Comerica Park's gates opening Saturday needed no such history lesson.

Many have personal memories of Whitaker's 19 seasons wearing the Old English ""D."" The sellout crowd of 40101 (the second-largest crowd of the season) added another memory Saturday prior to the Tigers' game against the Tampa Bay Rays — the black tarp on the wall above the bullpen in left-center coming down to reveal Whitaker's name and No. 1 permanently inscribed at Comerica Park.

No. 1 will never be worn by a Tiger again.

""This will be one of the greatest moments in my life"" Whitaker said on the stage erected in the Comerica infied. ""Just knowing that my number will be retired and I have a chance to see my name on the wall with those legends from Tigers history.""

It was at times hard to hear master of ceremonies Dan Dickerson Trammell or any of the other teammates of Whitaker who shared their sentiments via a video shown on the board Saturday evening as more than 30000 fans serenaded the field with ""Looooouuuuuuuu.""

But the message was clear with Trammell — whose number was retired in 2018 soon after his induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame — setting the tone.

""Yes"" Trammell said when he took the mic. ""Why yes? Because for four years I've been uncomfortable. I have been extremely honored and grateful to have my No. 3 retired.

""But there wouldn’t be a No. 3 on the wall without the No. 1.""

IN THE BULLPEN:Luis Castillo's relief success unusual arm slot earns him callup from Tigers

Whitaker's ceremony was originally set for 2020 but the COVID-19 pandemic and a lack of fans allowed in the stadium forced a postponement past even 2021.

For many Saturday felt like decades in the making.

The link between Whitaker and Trammell was a common thread — how could it not be? The two played 1918 games together from 1977 to 1995 the most by a double-play combination in MLB history.

But before Whitaker threw the ceremonial first pitch to Trammell — a strike that didn't have quite the same zip on it as as Whitaker's trademark flip from second — Trammell recalled the day they met in the Florida Instructional League in 1976 not long after Whitaker had been selected league MVP. (The manager? Jim Leyland.)

Whitaker had long played third but on the first day of practice the team moved him to second. Had he been coming off an MVP season Trammell noted and coaches tried to change his position he might have said something.

But that's not who ""Sweet Lou"" was.

""In typical Lou Whitaker fashion he did what was best for the team"" Trammell said. ""We worked there for two months together the following year we went to Double-A together and in September we were called up to Detroit.

""And I guess you could say the rest is history.""

Whitaker has plenty of history in the Tigers organization: He was a five-time All-Star four-time Silver Slugger three-time Gold Glove winner 1978 AL Rookie of the Year and 1984 World Series champion.

He's third all-time in games for the Tigers fourth in runs scored second in walks and fourth in WAR (according to baseball-reference.com).

Whitaker ranks seventh all-time in WAR among MLB second basemen — all six ahead of him are in the Hall of Fame as are 14 others.

As far as anybody at Comerica Park was concerned that Cooperstown honor is overdue as well.

""I couldn’t be more honored to have No. 1 next to No. 3 linked together forever"" Trammell said. ""And you know what’s next? The Hall of Fame.""

Finally it was time for Whitaker to speak.

He opened by joking he ""finally"" got pitcher Jack Morris to thank him for his defensive service all those years.

He gave a shoutout to Martinsville Virginia where he grew up from age 1. No matter the sport — baseball football or basketball — he and his friends would ""play ball all day all night"" he said while citing the city as the reason for his career.

He thanked his family and friends as well as past teammates and the late Mike Ilitch.

Then he paused and as the cires of ""Looooouuuuuuuu"" grew louder extended his appreciation again for becoming the ninth Tiger with his number retired.

""I want to give love to the city of Detroit"" he said. ""A great baseball town. And all of Michigan and the great fans that we have all over this country.

Lou Whitaker was there on the infield. Alan Trammell was there with him. Jack Morris too. A packed crowd chanted LOUUUUU in a low baritone while highlights of dazzling double plays flashed on the video board.

All these years later Whitaker can still captivate a crowd.

And perhaps now more than ever Whitaker was at the center of attention finally a little more comfortable in the spotlight no longer the kid from Martinsville trying to navigate life in the major leagues. He is now an older man looking back on his career and his friendships appreciating the journey back then and all the gratitude that is coming his way now.

The Tigers retired Whitaker’s No. 1 on Saturday at Comerica Park an honor that had been a long time coming. The ceremony was supposed to happen in 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic. It had to wait two years so the Tigers could honor Whitaker in front of a full-capacity crowd.

Whitaker stood on a stage constructed on the Comerica Park infield Saturday and thanked the crowd raising his hands and calling for more as the fans belted his name. He talked of his playing career and 1984. He thanked a large contingent of friends and family from his small Virginia hometown. He recounted stories of playing ball through long summer days throwing rocks in the air and hitting them with a stick until enough pals would show up for a game. “They are the reason I’m here” he said.

Now 65 Whitaker cracked a couple of jokes and exuded the grace of a great. He soaked in the moment as stadium personnel removed a black veil on the brick wall out beyond left-center field and revealed his iconic No. 1. His last name is inscribed in white letters below the numeral.

How sweet it is. pic.twitter.com/CXV6GVCUEx — Detroit Tigers (@tigers) August 6 2022

A man too often regarded as introverted or reclusive has slowly opened up with age never more apparent than these past few days. And a man too often overlooked because of his size or his market or his position is finally getting his due.

“Up there with people I used to see when I grew up when we were playing up there with Trammell and Morris two teammates that’s huge” Whitaker said.

Whitaker on Saturday became the 17th name honored on the walls at Comerica Park and the 10th jersey number retired. Any mention of Whitaker these days opens a similar discussion about whether he should also be mentioned in the Hall of Fame.

Earlier this week in the Tigers clubhouse manager A.J. Hinch sat with pitchers Tarik Skubal Tyler Alexander Will Vest and Jason Foley. “We had a little bit of an assignment” Hinch said.

He was telling them about Whitaker’s career and he had the players pull out their phones and look up Whitaker comparing the arc of his career to that of Trammell the Tigers’ Hall of Fame shortstop who is still an ever-present figure around the organization. Current players know and revere Trammell. But they don’t all realize his double-play partner of 19 years — the longest and most prolific double-play tandem in baseball’s history — was equally as good. Whitaker had 2369 career hits. He was the 1978 Rookie of the Year made five All-Star teams won four Silver Slugger Awards and three Gold Gloves. Whitaker ranks seventh all time among second basemen with 75.1 career Wins Above Replacement a total higher than 15 other second basemen in the Hall of Fame.

Whitaker of course received only 2.1 percent of the vote in his lone appearance on the BBWAA ballot in 2001. In 2019 he received only six of the 12 votes needed to earn introduction via the Modern Era ballot. He will next be eligible for induction this winter through the Contemporary Baseball Era players committee.

“I will wait for that day” Whitaker said. “I’m sure that day will come. I might be 99 and walking with a cane saying ‘Finally what took you so long?’ But that day will come.”

Hall of Fame or not Whitaker is a legend in Detroit. That much was already clear but now his name and number are on the wall further cementing his legacy as one of the greatest players in the history of a franchise that has existed since 1901.

“For four years I’ve been uncomfortable” said Trammell who had his number retired in 2018. “I’m extremely honored and grateful to have my No. 3 retired. There wouldn’t be a No. 3 on the wall if not for No. 1.”

Whitaker’s number is now fittingly just to the right of Trammell’s on that brick wall. But Saturday was all about Whitaker alone. He said he knew he would be dazed when they unveiled the number. “Give me some time” Whitaker said. “One day I’ll come back in a year a few years a month maybe. I’ll come back to see my name just see what it’s like see what it really feels like.”

Whitaker was around Detroit for the past several days. There was a lunch and a dinner interviews people to meet hands to shake and stories to share.

“I’ve heard some beautiful comments” Whitaker said “talking about ‘Lou you’re gonna have a nice crowd at the field. They’re coming to see you.'”

He said that message brought him to tears.

Sweet Lou indeed.

In the months since the all-time highs reached by the US stock indices the markets have reminded investors that at some point what goes up will come down.

For dividend investors a good benchmark to follow is the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats which index of large companies that have raised their dividends every year for the past 25 years. During a market downturn dividend-paying stocks often prosper and during 2008 when Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 37% Dividend Aristocrats gave back a more palatable 22%.

In the same way a housing market crash can be financially painful stock price declines can be difficult to swallow especially for volatile Nasdaq listed stocks. However history has consistently shown that investing in quality stocks during corrections and bear markets pays off. While market declines pale compared to rallies that follow investors need to keep a level head manage their risk and do their research.

So a key question is: Which stocks should you buy on a dip?

High yields stocks provide a passive income but investors should be aware of inflation; Dividend investors who once considered stocks as high yield when inflation was low would have to revise their expectations with higher inflation.

Walmart (WMT)

Why do stocks such as Costco Wholesale Walmart and Procter & Gamble maintain their all-time highs as the broader indices decline? Their balance sheets are solid and they are all industry leaders. The three firms have unique pricing power that places them in a strong position to combat inflation.

Walmart has a simple investment thesis. Consumers will cut back on spending when prices rise and while gas prices may be beyond their control they can limit discretionary spending. Cost-conscious consumers are more likely to choose Walmart over Williams-Sonoma or other high-end retailers. A quick look at Walmart’s price chart compared to Williams-Sonoma is strong evidence of consumer preference.

Walmart’s stock remains relatively cheap despite outperforming the S&P 500 over the past five years by 137%. Walmart has a forward P/E ratio of 23.3. Moreover Walmart has been paying and increasing its dividend for 47 consecutive years making it a Dividend Aristocrat. In addition to reinvesting in its core business the company routinely raises its dividend and purchases its stock with extra cash flow.

As a result Walmart is now an excellent safe stock to consider due to its unique blend of upside value and income.

ExxonMobil (XOM)

Due to recent trends it may seem almost inexplicable that oil prices briefly fell into negative territory about two years ago. Pandemic conditions previously created a surplus of oil to the point that existing storage capacity exceeded oil production. But since the opening of the economy and resurging demand the trend has reversed dramatically.

The overall inflationary trend now causes a different economic worry and rising oil prices are one cause of this trend. In one way or the other almost industries are affected by the oil price making it the single most significant contributor to current inflationary trends.

Many companies are facing pressure from rising costs. Still ExxonMobil is benefiting from soaring oil prices. Due to high inflation levels it may remain one of the most successful performers if the stock market moves into bear-market territory.

In its industry Exxon is an industry titan and its large-scale and diverse business model has historically permitted it to thrive even when conditions are less favorable than they are today.

Economic conditions are likely to continue shaping in a manner consistent with high inflation so that Exxon could perform better than the market. The company’s demand outlook remains favorable even if high inflation pushes the economy into recession and businesses and consumers cut back on oil and energy usage.

Although alternative energy technologies have made some progress trends such as the emergence of the global middle class population growth and the expanding worldwide economy have made oil more essential than ever before.

Despite recent valuation gains Exxon Mobile continues to yield a substantial 4% dividend. ExxonMobil stock appears poised to beat inflation as profits climb and performance trends improve.

Abbott Laboratories (ABT)

Diagnostics medical devices and nutritional formulas company Abbott Labs (ABT) is profiting from the steady increase in health care needs. AbbVie (ABBV) the brand-name drugs business was spun off in 2013.

Abbott announced last year that it would sell its generics business in developed countries but keep it in developing ones. The move will allow Abbott to target faster-growing regions. According to investment bank Barclays an aging population and broader healthcare coverage will drive medical device sales by 2025.

Abbott has the most global exposure of the companies on this list with 69% of its sales coming from international markets in Q3. Even with a strong dollar company executives think the Chinese in-vitro diagnostics market will grow by more than 15% annually through 2022.

Consolidated Edison (ED)

For Consolidated Edison (ED) there will be no overseas exposure. In New York City and the surrounding area millions of customers receive their electric and gas service through the holding company. Con Ed earns steady profits because its business is highly regulated. The firm kept raising its dividend during the financial crisis and the company has increased its dividend for 41 years in a row.

Analysts are predicting Con Ed’s stock will grow by 1.3% in 2022 despite rising interest rates. If analysts are correct the utility’s solar energy investments will spur modest growth. Stocks with higher yields provide extra protection from bears if the decline is severe.

Clorox (CLX)

Stocks of consumer goods makers do better during a market downturn. Clorox (CLX) manufactures household cleaning products and is the best example. Its brands include bleach and Glad trash bags. Thus Clorox enjoyed annual sales growth of 4.5% from 2008 to 2010. Dividends have also been on the rise since 1977.

Recently competition has increased pressure on segments such as bleach disinfecting wipes and cat litter. The company is however launching its products. Analysts expect more growth for the fiscal year that ends this June after sales edged down by 0.3% last year. 20% of the company’s sales come from abroad.

Even though we are not (yet) in a bear market it is imperative to remain on high alert and seek out investments that will flourish regardless of the market’s overall direction.

Seeing how excited the kids were about engineering and seeing their efforts come to fruition has been an amazing experience.

It’s a cool and rainy April afternoon but Bridgeport’s Wakeman Boys & Girls Club gymnasium is a buzzing hive of activity.

Assistant professor of electrical and biomedical engineering John Drazan PhD and a group of Fairfield engineering students known as “SuSTEMability fellows” arrive to a swarm of excited children running toward them screaming “The engineers are here!”

Made possible by the E2 Energy to Educate Grant offered through Constellation Energy (a leading competitive energy company that provides power natural gas renewable energy and energy management products and services) SuSTEMability is a STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics) outreach program that engages Fairfield’s School of Engineering students and faculty with students and educators from Bridgeport’s Cesar Batalla School and Wakeman Boys & Girls Club — with a particular focus on sustainable energy and environmental efforts within engineering.

Mentored by Fairfield engineering undergraduates in this community-engaged learning experience elementary and middle school students acquire technical skills hone their critical thinking skills learn basic statistical techniques and develop a fundamental understanding of science sustainability and engineering concepts.

“We’re putting our first-years and sophomores in a position of trust to serve as mentors which is phenomenally important” said Dr. Drazan.

Led by the engineering professor and fellows Lorenzo Arabia ’25 Abigail Diltz ’25 Kobi Oktobi ’23 Margaret Millar ’25 and Megan Rourke ’24 each Wakeman session kicks off with an athletic activity such as basketball to illustrate how STEM principles relate to sports. The sessions then transition into engineering and sustainability lessons.

Using activities like basketball helps young participants see and understand engineering concepts. “We spend the first couple of sessions getting to know the students and incorporating STEM by asking them how buildings and various objects are created how basketball shots are made or how the gym is lit up” explained Rourke.

Following the engineering discussions the fellows engage their students in activities that apply the concepts they learned – things like basketball layup drills or building solar cars and fans which are then tested out in the gymnasium.

“What is really cool is that we are doing a lot of hands-on building where the students have the opportunity to not only measure their basketball performance but also build sustainable systems like a solar car or a solar windmill station” said Dr. Drazen. “The students are able to collect their own data and see tangibly how they can design these types of systems in a micro scale version and hopefully apply these lessons in their future careers.”

Students built miniature solar cars fans LED circuit boards and crank generators.

“We encourage the students to be bold in their curiosity. We’ve been able to focus on breaking into our groups and talking about how each student can make their own difference in the world by being a hero for those that will live in it after us” said Rourke.

At Cesar Batalla School Associate Professor Uma Balaji PhD and associate dean Elif Kongar PhD program director of Management of Technology joined SuSTEMability fellows Isabella Carrano ’24 Brianna Duswalt ’23 and Dermot Warner ’24 to engage middle school students in classroom lessons including one taught solely in Spanish. Topics included: the use of Light Emitting Diode (LED) lamps for energy conservation how motors and gears work in relation to solar energy sources of renewable energy and the responsible use of energy.

“Seeing how excited the kids were about engineering and seeing their efforts come to fruition has been an amazing experience” said Duswalt of the hands-on classroom activities that included creating LED circuit boards hand crank generators solar cars and solar fans.

“This experience has allowed me and the other fellows to inform future generations on how they can reduce their ecological footprint by small daily changes” said Carrano. “The SuSTEMability program allows us to expose youth to STEM education and excite them to create change in the world.”

At the School of Engineering students are taught to be engineers with a higher purpose: they are not only trained in technical skills and knowledge they are challenged to think about the impact they can make in the community.

Said Dr Kongar “Engagement in highquality science education is critical to attracting students to the sciences yet these enrichment opportunities are seldom accessible to populations presently underrepresented in STEM. SuSTEMability addresses both these issues by providing students from diverse backgrounds an understanding of sustainable engineering through age-appropriate enrichment opportunities that illustrate our role — as individuals and as a community — in building a climate-safe renewable future.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Chris Stewart SVP Sales UK & Eire Banijay Rights says: 'Marie Antoinette is an extraordinary fresh new take on one of France’s most iconic - and controversial - figures filled with stunning scenery fine performances and epic costumes.

'Following on from the success of Versailles on BBC Two we are excited to again bring the extravagance and excitement of French court life to UK viewers.'

It comes as filming for the highly anticipated series three of Bridgerton continued on Thursday as the cast were spotted on set in South London.

A first look of the new season of Netflix's hit show saw cast and crew arrive at a luxury country home in South London decorated with purple flowers.

An array of currently unknown cast members stood out in bold period attire while chatting in front of the stunning garden.

Several female actors were spotted in long chic gowns while carrying umbrellas to keep them shaded from the sun.

They were accompanied by male actors who looked dashing in 1800's costume's which included long suit jackets and fancy top hats.

The cast appeared to be filming a lavish event as they all gathered in their best gear outside of the grand venue.

The popular period drama has confirmed that it is back in production after the record-breaking second season was released in March.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhaGVyYWxkLmNvbS92aWV3LnBocD91ZD0yMDIyMDgwNzAwMDA0MNIBOGh0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYWhlcmFsZC5jb20vYW1wL3ZpZXcucGhwP3VkPTIwMjIwODA3MDAwMDQw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,[Herald Interview] Future of head-up display tech is in augmented reality,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhaGVyYWxkLmNvbS92aWV3LnBocD91ZD0yMDIyMDgwNzAwMDA0MNIBOGh0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYWhlcmFsZC5jb20vYW1wL3ZpZXcucGhwP3VkPTIwMjIwODA3MDAwMDQw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D82845120>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhaGVyYWxkLmNvbS92aWV3LnBocD91ZD0yMDIyMDgwNzAwMDA0MNIBOGh0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYWhlcmFsZC5jb20vYW1wL3ZpZXcucGhwP3VkPTIwMjIwODA3MDAwMDQw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRhdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2FjZXItY2hyb21lYm9vay1zcGluLTUxMy1yZXZpZXctMTIyMTgyMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Acer Chromebook Spin 513 review: Nails the basics on a budget,"Acer Chromebook Spin 513 Acer has crafted a competitive Chromebook in the Spin 513 which slots into the middle of the market and has plenty of fight in it to take on other Chromebooks.

About this Acer Chromebook Spin 513 review: I used the Acer Chromebook Spin 513 (CP513-1H-S37H) for seven days running Chrome OS 89 and 90. The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 review unit was provided to Android Authority by Acer for this review.

What you need to know about the Acer Chromebook Spin 513

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

Acer Chromebook Spin 513 (4GB RAM/64GB storage): $399/£399/€429 The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 is priced right. The main version being sold in the US features 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage and comes in one silvery finish. Acer hasn’t said if other variants of the machine will be sold over time. The device lands in the upper echelon of Acer Chromebooks sold by Walmart. Many of Acer’s devices on Walmart.com are priced $300 or less so a $400 machine is a step up.

Acer hopes the Spin 513 will appeal to students people who work from home and tech lovers seeking a Chromebook for general computing purposes. It’s not meant to be a gaming machine or heavy productivity workhorse. Its thin and lightweight build makes it portable and its 2-in-1 convertible design means it can be used in more ways than one.

How is the design?

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 sure features a lot of chrome. The top lid is made from aluminum and has a polished beveled reflective edge that defines the 513’s shape. It catches the eye for sure. This is joined by a reflective chrome Acer logo. Together these give the machine some flash. Most Chromebooks blend in so anything to help the device stand out is okay in my book.

Beyond that it’s a fairly straightforward 360-degree design. Rotating hinges join the two halves of the device and allow for a full range of articulation between them. Acer says the Spin 513 offers four usage modes: laptop tent tablet and presentation. Each of these works in its own way and lets people get out of the 513 what they want. The hinges feel strong smooth and hold the lid exactly where you want it to be.

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

It’s a slim and light Chromebook. The 13.3-inch display allowed Acer to keep the overall footprint down. The device measures 310 x 209.35 x 15.55mm (12.2 x 8.24 x 0.61 inches) and weighs in at 1.2kg (2.65lbs). This makes it highly portable. It easily fits into backpacks sacks and other bags without weighing you down. I carried it around NYC for a day and never felt burdened by it.

The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 sure features a lot of chrome.

Overall the build quality which mixes metals and plastics is solid. Nothing about this $400 Chromebook feels cheap or inexpensive. There’s something here for everyone to like.

How are the display and keyboard?

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

If there’s one thing cheap Chromebooks have in common it’s lots of unappealing bezel space. The 13.3-inch display has relatively thin bezels on three sides (top and left/right edges) but there’s a solid inch of black bezel below the display. This makes for a screen-to-body ratio of 78% says Acer. It’s not a bad look.

The screen is a Full HD panel in a 16:9 aspect ratio. While this is a common aspect ratio it’s not preferred by everyone. You’ll find 16:9 is great for watching movies and other online content but productivity-minded people might prefer a device with a 16:10 display for the additional vertical space. See also: Best Chromebooks under $300

Another common detractor to low-priced Chromebooks is low-res displays. Full HD is all anyone can ask for at this price point and it works well with the 13.3-inch dimensions. I found the screen to look crisp. On-screen elements such as icons and text had well-defined edges and were easy to read.

The display is also touch-enabled and protected by Corning Gorilla Glass. I found touch to be simple and responsive whether in laptop tablet or tent mode.

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

Apart from the display the keyboard is the other most essential part of any laptop. The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 has a solid keyboard that gets the job done. The backlight is one feature I can’t live without and I was pleased to see Acer made sure the Spin 513 has backlit keys. My only complaint is that the light aggressively shuts off after a few seconds of no input. The keyboard is full-sized but lacks a number pad (something we wouldn’t expect on a 13-inch device).

The Chromebook Spin 513 has a solid keyboard and a large responsive touchpad.

As for the keys themselves they are a little bit soft in the travel department. They’re also fairly large and require a lot of pushing. I prefer keyboards with shorter action but you may find it’s right up your alley.

I am a big fan of glass trackpads and the Spin 513 has a large responsive Gorilla Glass-covered touchpad that gets the job done.

Does the battery hold up?

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

Acer gave the Chromebook Spin 513 a 4670mAh 36Wh lithium-ion battery. The two-cell power pack is rated for all-day use and it delivers.

Acer says the rated runtime of the Spin 513 is 13.5 hours. I saw average battery life of 13.2 hours. Just shy of Acer’s rating but close enough. I saw one instance where the battery exceeded the maximum by about 15 minutes.

With 13+ hours of power the Chromebook 513 offers more than enough run time to get your work done watch movies or browse the web for info on a school project.

How’s that Qualcomm processor?

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 is one of the very few Chromebooks to ship with a Qualcomm — rather than Intel or MediaTek — processor on board. Specifically the Spin 513 is powered by the Snapdragon 7c Compute SC7180 with an Adreno 618 GPU. The configuration of the device we have includes 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage but no expandable storage slots. I would have preferred to see a bit more RAM or storage or at least expandable storage at this price point. Acer did suggest late last year that a version with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage will also be available. However this hasn’t been further detailed at the time of publishing this review.

Though the Snapdragon 7c supports LTE connectivity the model we tested does not. Acer told us that a commercial model with integrated LTE will be launched later with price and specs to be announced.

Testing showed the Chromebook Spin 513 to be a solid everyday machine.

As for day-to-day use I’ve tested the Snapdragon 7c in Windows machines and can tell you that basic performance of this chip is solid. Whereas in Windows machines the Snapdragon 7c introduces an app limitation based on the ARM compute profile you’ll find no such limitations here in Chrome OS. The 7c delivers the power the Spin 513 needs to push through everyday tasks. It allowed the device to download and install Android apps and it never suffered from slowdowns or lag while I tested the Chromebook.

While the Spin 513 didn’t set the world on fire with its benchmark performance in my testing the results showed the Chromebook to be a solid everyday machine. Most importantly the Spin 513 managed dozens of open tabs at a time without slowing down.

Anything else?

Ports: The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 has two USB-C ports one USB-A port and a 3.5mm combination headphone/microphone jack. You’ll need one of the USB-C ports to charge the Chromebook but Acer says the USB-C ports are full-fledged USB 3.2 (Gen 1) with DisplayPort.

Video camera: The Chromebook 513 is limited to a 720p HD cam which isn’t good enough for this day and age. I looked a bit ragged in the video calls I conducted and low-light performance wasn’t great.

Value and competition

Acer Chromebook Spin 513 Acer has crafted a competitive Chromebook in the Spin 513 which slots into the middle of the market and has plenty of fight in it to take on other Chromebooks. It boasts a good display solid keyboard and excellent battery life. See price at Walmart

The market for $400 Chromebooks is packed with competition. Acer did a solid job with the Chromebook Spin 513 in terms of the value equation by nailing the basics. The design is appealing and the machine is well built. The 2-in-1 design gives it lots of functionality. Moreover Acer dialed in the right screen size/resolution the right keyboard and the right battery life. You’d have to spend more for a larger Full HD touch display or better performance.

Competitors to the Spin 513 include the Lenovo Flex 5 which has a 13-inch Full HD display 4GB of RAM and a 360-degree hinge. It bests the 513 in one category: the processor. For $40o the Lenovo Flex 5 has an Intel Core i3 chip on board which should outperform the Spin 513’s Snapdragon 7c. See also: The best Chromebooks to get | The best Chromebook deals

If you have a little more room in your budget you might consider the ASUS Flip C434. It’s one of the best-reviewed Chromebooks in the last few years and though it’s a little bit older it still holds up. It’s available online for about $470.

If you want to stick with Acer the Chromebook 514 or 515 are in the same ballpark price-wise but give you bigger screens.

Acer Chromebook Spin 513 review: The verdict

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

Acer has crafted a competitive Chromebook in the Spin 513. It slots into the low-end of the mid-range and has plenty of fight in it to take on other Chromebooks in the market.

In the plus column the Acer Chromebook Spin 513 features a well-built 360-degree spin design that makes the laptop more useful than a standard clamshell. Acer did a good job with the 13.3-inch Full HD touch screen. The keyboard and touchpad combination kept pace with my input demands and the large battery delivered long-lasting life.

Few Chromebooks offer as many features and as much value at this price point despite the shortcomings.

In the minus column some might chide Acer for selecting the Snapdragon 7c silicon. It’s not the most powerful processor on the market but it managed to push through day-to-day computing tasks with no problems. I’m more disappointed by the meager 4GB of RAM on the base model I reviewed and the lack of expandable storage. Another USB-A or USB-C port might have been nice too and the 720p webcam is definitely not up to snuff for dedicated video callers.

Despite all that the Acer Chromebook Spin 513 is a fine machine for the money. You’ll find few Chromebooks that offer as many features and as much value at this price point.

There are more than meet the eye and they are occupied by various members of royalty

How many royal residences are there and does the Royal Family own them all?

The British Royal Family may no longer hold the power they once had but their influence over the nation remains profound.

The legacy of their past lives on through their royal residences with plenty of them still privately owned by The Queen and other members of the family.

However the bulk of them are owned by the Crown Estate an independent commercial business created by an Act of Parliament.

There is also the Duchy of Cornwall a separate entity that owns 7552 hectares of land in the country.

It’s a complex system spread across dozens of Royal Family members who are still living in these decadent homes.

How many Royal residences are there?

There are 23 royal residences scattered across the UK though there have been plenty more in the past.

Some of the main palaces include Buckingham Palace Windsor Castle Holyrood Palace Balmoral Sandringham and Hillsborough Castle.

Privately owned royal residences and their occupants:

Sandringham House - The Queen

Balmoral Castle - The Queen

Craigowan Lodge - The Queen

Birkhall – Prince Charles and Camilla Duchess of Cornwall

Anmer Hall – Prince William and Kate Middleton

Gatcombe Park – Anne Princess Royal

Barnwell Manor – Prince Richard and Birgitte Duchess of Gloucester

Crown-owned royal residences and their occupants:

Windsor Castle - The Queen

Palace of Holyroodhouse - The Queen

Hillsborough Caste - The Queen

There are also the properties owned by the Duchy of Cornwall a private estate established by Edward III in 1337 to provide independence to his son and heir Prince Edward.

The eldest son of the reigning British monarch inherits possession of the Duchy and title of Duke of Cornwall at birth or when his parent succeeds to the throne.

However they may not sell assets for their personal benefit and have limited rights and income while a minor.

This means Charles Prince of Wales is currently the Duchy of Cornwall and therefore owns them.

Duchy of Cornwall's royal residences:

Highgrove House - Prince Charles and Camilla Duchess of Cornwall

Llwynywermod - Prince Charles and Camilla Duchess of Cornwall

Tamarisk House - Prince Charles and Camilla Duchess of Cornwall

The Queen only privately owns two homes Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House.

Wade in June.

On Saturday morning one of Indiana’s biggest employers the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly issued a strong objection to the new restrictions. “Given this new law” it said in a statement “we will be forced to plan for more employment growth outside our home state.”

The company which employs more than 10000 people in Indiana began by saying that “abortion is a divisive and deeply personal issue with no clear consensus among the citizens of Indiana.” It noted that Eli Lilly has expanded its employee health plan coverage to include travel for reproductive services. But it added “that may not be enough for some current and potential employees.”

It was among the first major employers in the state to weigh in on the new law.

Shortly after Jon Mills a spokesman for Cummins an engine company that employs about 10000 people in the state said: “The right to make decisions regarding reproductive health ensures that women have the same opportunity as others to participate fully in our work force and that our work force is diverse. There are provisions in the bill that conflict with this impact our people and impede our ability to attract and retain top talent.” He added that Cummins’s health care benefits cover elective reproductive health procedures including medical travel benefits.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdXRvZXZvbHV0aW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL3dlc3Rlbi1jaGFtcGxpbi1oYXRlcy1ib2F0cy13b24tdC1zdG9wLWZyb20taGltLXRvd2luZy1vbmUtd2l0aC1hLWN1bW1pbnMtc3dhcHBlZC1tdXN0YW5nLTE5NTM3OS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Westen Champlin Hates Boats Won't Stop Him From Towing One With a Cummins-Swapped Mustang,"Westen Champlin is a man with simple tastes. Big turbos bigger engines and lots of long straight Kansas roads surrounded by cornfields on either side to do burnouts in. But for no other reason other than a lust for something to tow with his beloved Cummins diesel-swapped late model Ford Mustang the ""Smokestang"" he decided to get a boat.

And so a 1986 Cobalt river boat with a small-block V8 under the rear hatch appears before Westen as if by YouTube magic. He actually got it from his mom bless her heart. To Westen's surprise the small-block engine is topped off with oil and fluids. They can even get the thing started with a liberal dose of starting fluid. But again when it comes to anything on the water Westen might as well believe they're all called Boaty McBoatface.The point of bothering with this shag-carpeted aquatic embodiment of the mid-80s is to use it as an excuse to tow something with the Smokestang while doing a big smokey burnout. Western accomplishes his main goal with flying colors. One can only imagine how much he spends on tires each month. But now it was time for the moment that deep down Westen was clearly dreading.With a tank full of gas and some gawking stares and compliments from passers-by the old Cobalt boat was ready to take to the water for the first time since Westen was still in grade school maybe even longer. Hours of towing his friends along behind him in rubber rafts and in the passenger seats end with the obligatory engine failure that no barnfind vehicle video could be complete without.In the blink of an eye the boat's engine lost oil pressure began and started knocking like the percussion section of an orchestra. It left our favorite V8-swapping farmboy and his buddies stranded out on the water. For all we know they're still stranded out there. (Not really).

Just after 11 p.m. Holcomb announced his support and signature to the bill.

SB 1 outlines a near-total ban on abortions in Indiana with exceptions for rape incest and the life of the mother.

Leaders and lawmakers both locally and nationally are speaking out after the passage of the bill. Business owners are also responding.

Late last night the Indiana General Assembly passed a comprehensive abortion bill that the Governor has signed into law. We are deeply concerned about how this law impacts our people and impedes our ability to attract and retain a diverse workforce in Indiana – concerns that we have voiced to legislators. Cummins believes that women should have the right to make reproductive healthcare decisions as a matter of gender equity ensuring that women have the same opportunity as others to participate fully in the workforce and that our workforce is diverse. This law is contrary to this goal and we oppose it.



For Cummins to be successful it is critical that we have a safe and welcoming workplace and communities where we embrace our difference and enable all employees to thrive. As we continue to grow our footprint with a focus on selecting communities that align with our values and business goals this law will be considered in our decision-making process.



We have also been clear and consistent in advocating that we will continue to provide our employees with access to high-quality affordable healthcare regardless of where they live and are able to make healthcare decisions based on what they believe is right for them.



This law does not affect our right to offer reproductive health benefits and we will continue to offer such benefits to our employees. Cummins

“Lilly recognizes that abortion is a divisive and deeply personal issue with no clear consensus among the citizens of Indiana. Despite this lack of agreement Indiana has opted to quickly adopt one of the most restrictive anti-abortion laws in the United States. We are concerned that this law will hinder Lilly’s – and Indiana’s - ability to attract diverse scientific engineering and business talent from around the world. While we have expanded our employee health plan coverage to include travel for reproductive services unavailable locally that may not be enough for some current and potential employees.



As a global company headquartered in Indianapolis for more than 145 years we work hard to retain and attract thousands of people who are important drivers of our state’s economy. Given this new law we will be forced to plan for more employment growth outside our home state.”

Eli Lilly and Company

“Across the county states with bans on abortion are facing numerous lawsuits and these laws are being blocked in the courts. The ACLU of Indiana exists to defend Hoosiers’ rights as protected by the U.S. and the state constitution. You can guarantee that our legal team will be working with partners to evaluate every legal avenue available to defend abortion access here in Indiana.”



It is a dark day in the state of Indiana. The General Assembly has passed a ban on abortion turning back the clock 50 years on Hoosiers’ fundamental right to control their own bodies. S.B. 1 will force women to either travel hundreds of miles or carry pregnancies against their will resulting in life-altering consequences and serious health risks. This is an unconscionable attack on our freedom.



Indiana is once again making history by passing legislation that takes our state backward. Despite an unprecedented turnout from Hoosiers who oppose a ban on abortion Indiana has become the first state in the country to pass a new abortion ban since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.



Hoosiers have a constitutional right to privacy and these deeply private personal and unique decisions should be made by women in consultation with their doctors. What is right for one family may not be right for another."" Katie Blair advocacy and public policy director at the ACLU of Indiana

""We believe substantive changes to SB1 in the House provide renewed hope that over 95 percent of Indiana’s 8414 abortions will end if it becomes law. The House amendments will make abortion clinics a thing of the past in Indiana effective mid-September and abortions for limited circumstances will be performed only in hospitals or hospital-owned surgical centers.



We are nonetheless disappointed that an amendment to limit abortions to only the life of the mother fell short in a roll call vote. Yet we applaud those House members supporting the amendment for doing all they could to limit SB1’s exceptions. We will continue to work to build consensus going forward that all lives are to be valued regardless of the means of one's conception.



Although we cannot fully endorse the amended SB1 due to its rape incest and lethal fetal anomaly exceptions we do acknowledge the path forward is to either embrace the potential to end the vast majority of abortions in Indiana now or to allow all abortions to continue under current law making Indiana an abortion-destination state and driving abortion numbers even higher.



We encourage Gov. Holcomb to sign SB1 into law. It’s time for Indiana to move forward in love and compassion by expanding protections for unborn children."" Indiana Right to Life

""So Proud of Indiana for becoming the First State to pass strong Pro-Life legislation since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade! Thank you @GovHolcomb  Pro-Life Leaders in the IN General Assembly & @irtl for this Victory For Life! Life is Winning!"" Former Vice President and former Indiana Governor Mike Pence via Twitter

At IU Health we take seriously our responsibility to provide access to compassionate and safe high-quality healthcare for anyone who needs it. IU Health’s priority remains ensuring our physicians and patients have clarity when making decisions about pregnancy within the limits of the law. We will take the next few weeks to fully understand the terms of the new law and how to incorporate the changes into our medical practice to protect our providers and care for the people seeking reproductive healthcare.

“I am deeply disappointed that the excessive majority chose to pass Senate Bill 1 and roll back the clock 50 years. They chose to listen to a special interest group over everyday Hoosiers who adamantly oppose this cruel bill. The ramifications of this legislation for women are endless even deadly. That’s not hyperbole—in a state with the 3rd highest maternal mortality rate in the nation this ban will kill women. The majority are not ending abortions only safe ones. I firmly believe that this bill denies a woman bodily autonomy and her right to make her own healthcare decisions.



During testimony we heard many faith leaders—Christian and non-Christian—speak in adamant opposition to this bill. SB 1 undermines the many religions in Indiana that have diverse thoughts and beliefs on the subject of life and abortion. No one religion should trump another under our laws.



Finally not one Hoosier genuinely testified in favor of the bill. The people of Indiana are against SB 1 and we should have scrapped the bill in the Senate. Unfortunately we did not and I encourage Hoosiers to reach out to Governor Holcomb and encourage him to veto this cruel bill.”



Sen. J.D. Ford (D - Indianapolis)

The Indiana legislature took a devastating step as a result of the Supreme Court’s extreme decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and eliminate women’s constitutionally-protected right to abortion. And it’s another radical step by Republican legislators to take away women’s reproductive rights and freedom and put personal health care decisions in the hands of politicians rather than women and their doctors. Yesterday’s vote which institutes a near-total abortion ban in Indiana should be a signal to Americans across the country to make their voices heard. Congress should also act immediately to pass a law restoring the protections of Roe – the only way to secure a woman’s right to choose nationally. Until then President Biden is committed to taking action to protect women’s reproductive rights and freedom and access to care they are afforded under Federal law. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre

“I’m extremely disappointed the Statehouse Republicans passed this extreme legislation that restricts reproductive rights in Indiana disregards science and medicine and forces one religious view on all Hoosiers regardless of their religious or non-religious values. In a pluralistic society legislators should not impose their religious beliefs to restrict civil liberties and freedoms of any citizen. SB 1 is an extreme government overreach and an unfunded mandate in a state that is ill-equipped to serve Hoosier children foster youth adopted children and already ranks in the bottom ten nationally on infant and maternal health. I don’t believe that the God of any faith promotes rape or incest or that any child should be forced by the government to carry another child from those horrific acts. I trust Hoosier women to make these decisions in consultation with their physicians and faith if they choose to rather than a male-dominated non-medical General Assembly making health decisions for women. Legislators shouldn’t play God or politicize women’s healthcare. I stand with all Hoosier women and will continue to champion their freedoms and civil liberties.” Sen. Fady Qaddoura (D - Indianapolis)

""Like the majority of Senate District 42 constituents who answered my survey I believe every mother and unborn child are worthy of dignity and legal protection and today the Indiana legislature made great strides in ensuring that through Senate Enrolled Act 1.



The bill includes exceptions for rape incest life or physical health of the mother and fatal fetal anomalies with time limitations.



Senate Republicans understand Indiana residents need additional support which is why we passed a companion bill – Senate Enrolled Act 2 which allocates funds for family support programs and provides financial relief to residents through an additional automatic taxpayer refund.



As we see more babies born in a post-Roe world Indiana must do everything it can to support women in delivering and raising healthy children while helping them prevent unexpected pregnancies through contraception and education. In doing so Indiana will continue to be a home for many to feel treasured and supported in leading fulfilling lives."" Sen. Jean Leising (R - Oldenburg)

""This is a monumental day for the unborn in Indiana. By closing abortion clinics and limiting abortions to only the most heartbreaking instances we are making massive strides for the pro-life movement. These steps combined with funding increases directed toward pregnancy services and easing the financial burden of adoption put Indiana in a position to be a shining example of how to move past abortion and give mothers and families the ability to raise happy healthy children."" Sen. Jack E. Sandlin (R - Indianapolis)

""Tonight I voted no on because it does not strike the right balance for women to make their own health decisions while also protecting the life of the unborn. Further the time allowed for the exceptions for rape or incest victims and for fatal fetal anomalies is far less than I believe is appropriate."" Sen. Kyle Walker (R - Lawrence)

ALL people deserve the right to decide what they do with their own bodies. It’s a tragedy that SB 1 was passed and the safety of all people who can become pregnant including survivors is at risk. Bodily autonomy is a right and it was stripped from us today.



But we will continue to fight and advocate for the right to bodily autonomy. We stand with the majority of Hoosiers who oppose SB 1 and an abortion ban. Abortion is healthcare!

Domestic Violence Network via Twitter

“This attack on maternal health is outrageous and we call on Governor Holcomb to side with the majority and veto S.B 1. This abortion ban would deny Hoosiers the care they need with catastrophic impacts on Indiana’s already dire maternal mortality crisis. The Indiana government is inserting itself into private decisions about when and whether to have children and it is unconscionable and unacceptable. We cannot let extremist Indiana lawmakers take away our control over our own bodies. We must put the people of Indiana first and stop this ban here now and permanently.” Jennifer M. Allen CEO of Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates

“Thousands of Hoosiers showed up to express their opposition to this bill. Our elected officials did not listen and they voted against us. Women4Change will not stop advocating for reproductive justice so Hoosiers have the freedom to control decisions that affect their bodies and impact their lives. Women should have the right to make critical decisions about their health including the right to safe and legal abortions. Those decisions should be between a patient and doctor—the state has no right to intervene.” Rima Shahid Women4Change CEO

“If this body really believed in liberty autonomy and small government this bill would have been dead on arrival. It wouldn’t have even been considered let alone passed. As it stands today marks a backward slide into history into a past where the lives and destinies of women are dictated by their government. The Republicans seem intent on pushing their religious beliefs their moral crusade and their own backwards attitudes onto Hoosiers against overwhelming opposition. Meanwhile as they rush through stripping women’s rights and ignoring 50 years of legal precedent Republicans say ‘next session’ to Democratic pushes to improve support and services for pregnant women and infants. Republicans’ vision for our state and their policy stance has never been clearer: Welcome to the new Indiana where forced birth is a moral imperative and your individual rights are subject to extremist big government intrusion.” Sen. Tim Lanane (D - Anderson)

""Thanks to IN Republicans Hoosier women are now lesser human beings than we were yesterday. We have lost the right to self-determination to autonomy to the futures we want to build for ourselves. It’s an outrage and an imposition on freedom equality & the values of democracy.



It’s a betrayal of Hoosiers most of whom want access to abortion to stand in some form. I’ve opposed this bill in every form at every stage and I will continue to oppose it as the law of the land. This bill is a stain on Indiana. The fight continues.""

Tyler was 30 years old a graduate of Dartmouth High School and Bridgewater State University when he took his own life in 2018.

His uncle Joel Baptista said Tyler's smile could light up a room but it was amazing how much that smile could hide.

""We saw some signs and help was provided but sometimes the pain is just too much and people can't see the light at the end of the tunnel"" Baptista said. ""We have a close-knit family but we just didn't know it would come to that.""

Jenelle Hickey is the coordinator of a program at Child and Family Services that assists young people at risk of suicide giving them the help they need to hopefully move forward.

Both Baptista and Hickey joined Townsquare Sunday this week to discuss suicide in our area.

After Tyler's death Baptista said his family decided to form a foundation to assist organizations working with young people on suicide prevention. That organization is Child and Family Services and Janelle Hickey's CBAT unit.

""We work with kids (ages) four to 17 who are in an acute mental health crisis"" Hickey said. ""That might mean depression anxiety or having suicidal thoughts and feelings.""

She said youngsters in the program stay about two weeks while personnel work on getting them to feel better.

CBAT currently has nine beds but it will grow to 15 when the program moves to the former Regal House building on Church Street sometime after the New Year. Hickey said her program is always full and sadly it's not uncommon for people at risk to have to wait for placement.

The Tyler Joseph Leonard Memorial Foundation will hold a fundraiser on September 10 from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. at the Allendale Country Club in Dartmouth. It will feature music dancing a silent auction and much more.

Proceeds from the event will fund a scholarship for a Dartmouth High School student and the CBAT program at Child and Family Services. For information and tickets visit thetylerjosephleonardmemorialfoundation.org.

By Aaron Humes: If you’re flying Delta Air Lines any time soon there may be a familiar face to look out for.

A resident of Benque Viejo Town Cayo District Danica Bradley has joined Delta Air Lines as a flight attendant as of Friday.

On social media she said her confirmation of joining the Delta ranks “was one of the happiest and proudest moments of my life. [Those] close to me know what my dream career has been since I was 7 years old. After 6 weeks of intense training I graduated and my dream came true.”

She expressed her gratitude and humility to accept this opportunity and hailed “fantastic” instructors and “amazing” friendships on the way to “working for the greatest airline known and respected globally.”

Area Representative for Cayo West Jorge Espat left his congratulations saying the division was proud of a dream accomplished by one of its own.

We also say congratulations and look forward to seeing Danica in the air wherever she goes.

Chances are more than you have spent before.

With widespread inflation and lingering supply chain issues due to the effects of the pandemic and workforce shortages this year could be a doozy on the back-to-school budget. However here in Vermont there are some strategies you could use to see savings and ensure you get everything on your list.

So break out that calculator − and then send it along with your student to school. They may need it for math class.

How school supply prices and inventory have been affected in Vermont

National trends suggest inflation has pushed up the cost of goods including school supplies by 9.1% over last year. However you can expect to spend 27% more on back-to-school purchases when compared to three years ago in 2019.

A Deloitte poll showed 64% of American families felt they couldn't afford back-to-school shopping this year without using a credit card or dipping into savings. Those numbers reflect purchases that include clothing and footwear.

Vermont is certainly feeling the effects.

You can see the difference in prices year over year particularly with brand-name products. Sharpie for instance is more expensive than last year according to Andrea Clark who is an Inventory specialist at the Staples store at Maple Tree Place in Williston.

She said while prices may be a little higher overall on many products you can find lots of savings by shopping store brands.

So far inventory is good according to Clark but that could change as we near the start of school. Here in Chittenden County most schools start during the final days of August or after Labor Day in September.

Currently much of the inventory is out on the floor at Staples. Clark said you can see boxes filled with similar product stacked near their display. This allows people who want to buy in bulk such as teachers to do so more easily.

Ways to save on back-to-school shopping

There are a variety of areas where you may be able to save a few bucks.

It can be frustrating to see back-to-school ads everywhere as many southern states are ending their summer break now weeks before we will here in Vermont. But it can be a great time to find some end of summer deals. Keep your eye out for back-to-school specials and coupons and this applies to online shopping as well.

Some states have a tax free holiday in August where the sales tax is dropped temporarily. This could mean saving the 6% in tax you would normally pay in Vermont. With a 9% increase on goods due to inflation you could be paying just 3% more on average if you're not paying sales tax.

Connecticut and Massachusetts are the nearest states with sales tax holidays. Making the trip may make the most sense if you can combine it with a planned vacation so that the gas money to get there doesn't eclipse the savings. The Massachusetts holiday is Aug. 13 and 14 when sales tax will be exempt on retail purchases for single items that cost less than $2500.

One of the best ways to save on supplies according to Clark who has worked at Staples and Target is to buy store brand items. ""If you have your own brand you can play with prices which is helpful to the customer"" she said.

At Staples you can get 35 cent notebooks a 50 cent package of 24 crayons or pay 50 cents for a composition notebook. While your list may call for some particular brands there are a lot of cheaper store brand items that can help even out expenditures. Clark says you can get Staples brand tape markers pens post-its and lots more.

Check off those items before they run out

One of the best things you can do to ensure you find everything on your list is to not wait until the last minute to shop. The inventory and selection is better the earlier you make your rounds. Clark said back-to-school season is their Christmas. So just like shopping in December expect stores to run out of some products and there to be long lines just before the start of school.

Clark said their lines can back up from the register to the bathroom on particularly popular days. With staffing shortages affecting workers and training new people on the register she asks for patience from customers.

Teachers are often supplying their classrooms as well. So while there may have been 30 folders available one day they may be gone the next having all been purchased at once.

There are two Staples in Chittenden County − the other one is on Williston Road in South Burlington. As some of the most well known office supply stores they could attract families from all over the county.

Places to get school supplies that may not be top of mind

Hoping to avoid where every other student might be getting their supplies − such as Staples Walmart and Target? Here are some alternative places to look. Some of these may have loyalty programs that can help you save on other purchases later.

Drug stores like Kinney Drug CVS Walgreens and Rite Aid usually have the essential school supplies on hand. Your local grocery store can also be a place to find pens pencils markers crayons highlighters and paper. Don't forget they are great for purchasing those tissue boxes and disinfecting wipes on the list which can be more expensive at an office supply store.

Dollar stores are a good place to look. There is a Dollar Tree in Burlington and Essex Junction and a Family Dollar in Essex Junction.

Art supply stores often have the markers crayons glue sticks scissors and paper. There are local art supply stores such as Vermont Art Supply or you can try Michaels or JoAnn Fabric.

Vermont is also known for its local general stores. Many may have some of the products you need.

You can also shop online and have purchases delivered to your preferred local store so you don't have to pay shipping.

Two-Buck Chuck. Simple Truth. Cat & Jack. Great Value. Amazon Basics. Store brands have never been more popular.

They have become forces in their own right and make up around 21% of sales in the $1.7 trillion US grocery industry according to IRI.

As prices surge store brands — also known as private labels white labels or generic brands — have become an even more attractive option for inflation-fatigued shoppers who are looking to switch from pricier name brands. Store brands can be anywhere from 10% to 50% cheaper.

But the origins of store brands remain largely secretive.

Retailers aren't typically forthcoming about the companies that make their brands. And manufacturers likewise have little incentive to reveal that they're creating similar products to their name brands under a different label sold on the cheap.

Many leading national brand manufacturers create private labels for multiple retailers. In the late 1990s more than half of brand manufacturers were estimated to make private goods as well.

Although store brands ostensibly compete with manufacturers' national brands manufacturers often have excess capacity on their production lines. To generate additional profit some will use that extra capacity to make private labels.

Other brand manufacturers will produce private labels as an incentive for retailers hoping they'll be rewarded with better shelf space and placement for their own national labels.

""Most manufacturers aren't open about it"" said Jan-Benedict E.M. Steenkamp a marketing professor at the University of North Carolina who studies private labels and branding. ""Manufacturers don't want it to be known because it undermines the power of their own brands.""

But there are some exceptions. Kimberly-Clark the maker of Huggies diapers produces Kirkland Signature diapers for Costco and Duracell produces Kirkland Signature batteries Costco executives have said.

Georgia-Pacific the maker of Brawny and Dixie also produces store brands. So does Henkel the manufacturer of Purex and Dial.

Eight O'Clock Coffee and Kenmore

Store labels have been around since the early days of retail and the emergence of consumer brands in the 19th century.

Macy's sold stoneware whiskey jugs under its own name. Customers could bring back the jugs for refills according to Christopher Durham the president of the Velocity Institute a trade association for private brands.

Montgomery Ward developed its own line of aspirin in wooden containers while the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. (aka A&P) sold branded spices with the slogan ""Take the Grandmother's Advice Use A&P Spices."" A&P later developed Eight O'Clock Coffee one of the most famous private labels of the period.

Yet no US retailer was more successful developing its own brands than Sears Roebuck.

In 1925 Sears created the Allstate brand for car tires. A few years later Sears launched its first Craftsman wrench according to Durham. Its Kenmore line which started as a sewing machine brand in 1913 before branching into vacuums and other home appliances became the leading home appliance brand in the United States.

These private labels were the exception however.

For most of the 20th century national brands such as Jell-O H.J. Heinz Campbell Soup and Johnson & Johnson had power over stores. These manufacturers flooded the airwaves and newspapers with advertisements extolling the advantages of their products.

Most customers were fiercely loyal to specific brands not retailers. A store that didn't carry major labels would likely get crushed which gave manufacturers immense leverage.

Additionally many store brands were also considered dull cheap knockoffs of national brands.

The low point of private label came during the 1970s Durham said when stores seeking to cut costs and rolled out generics with basic white backgrounds and black letters identifying the product -- beer soap cola beans and other staples.

Shopper loyalty

Retailers make private label brands for a variety of reasons including to boost profitability and sometimes as a negotiating tool against brands.

Private brands often carry profit margins that are 20% to 40% higher than national brands because stores don't have to pay the advertising distribution or other markup costs that are embedded in major brands' prices.

In the mid-20th century many retailers started to develop their own labels to claw back bargaining power from dominant suppliers and keep their prices in check. As the US retail industry has consolidated in recent decades the power dynamic between retailers and suppliers reversed. Now stores have more leverage to introduce their own labels -- whether name brands like it or not.

""Forty years ago Walmart pissing off P&G would be a risky situation. Now Walmart is much bigger than P&G"" said Steenkamp the marketing professor.

Today stores' private brand operations are more sophisticated than ever and a much bigger focus for chains.

Stores are likelier these days to develop a distinctive private brand or product to stand out against competitors and create shopper loyalty said Krishnakumar Davey the president of client engagement at IRI.

Costco for example will decide to make a Kirkland Signature product because a leading brand won't sell to the retailer. Or Costco believes the name brand's prices have gotten too high and it can make its own similar-quality product and sell it for 20% less.

Costco hasn't lost any relationships with suppliers by launching its own Kirkland products but those brands are not usually pleased when Costco introduces one company CFO Richard Galanti said in an interview earlier this year.

Retailers have been sued for creating products that too closely resemble national brands. The owner of golf ball-brand Titleist sued Costco for patent infringement while Williams-Sonoma sued Amazon for selling ""knockoffs"" under its own brand. Both cases were settled.

The US House Judiciary Committee and other lawmakers and regulators around the world have investigated whether Amazon uses data from sellers to create its own brands and unlawfully favors its own brands on its website.

Amazon has said it doesn't use the data from individual third-party sellers to inform the development of its own private brands and does not favor its own products on the site.

Most stores start small with their own brands. Grocers for example will often first introduce a shelf-stable product like pasta flour sugar or rice that's easier to make and where brand loyalty within the category isn't strong.

""You don't start with the most difficult things"" Steenkamp said. ""As stores build more experience and success then they enter new categories.""

How to find out who makes store brands

So how do you tell who's behind your favorite store brands?

Product recalls are often the most revealing way to find out which brand manufacturers are behind specific private labels.

Last year for example Dole recalled fresh salads and vegetables including private brands for Walmart Kroger and H-E-B.

J.M. Smucker recalled certain Jif peanut butter products this year as well as store-branded items it made for Giant Eagle Wawa and Safeway. Large companies such as Conagra and McCain Foods have recalled products from Trader Joe's.

Then there are the dedicated private label manufacturers such as Treehouse Foods which makes snacks under the labels of supermarkets big-box chains and other retailers. Nearly one-quarter of the company's $4.3 billion in sales last year for example came from Walmart.

James Walser who led the launch of Target's up & up household basics and personal care brand in 2009 said that Target tried to move away from national brand manufacturers during up & up's development to nimbler suppliers focused solely on making private labels.

Some large retailers also make their own private labels. Kroger for example makes about 30% of its own private products.

Perhaps the strangest store brand manufacturers are retailers that make private brands for their ... competitors: Safeway-owned Lucerne Foods manufactures private labels for Safeway's rivals.

No they’re not studying where the real estate market is up. Instead they’re looking for places where temperatures spike 10 to 20 degrees higher than their surrounding areas because of geographic features like concrete buildings and lack of trees. On summer’s hot days people who live in these “urban heat islands” can face a higher risk of heat-related health problems.

To find these hot zones geography professor Kirstin Dow organized a heat mapping project with the City of Columbia Tree and Appearance Commission. On Saturday August 6 volunteers hit the streets with sensors on their vehicles to measure temperatures as they drove routes throughout the city.

The location and temperature data collected by those sensors will allow Dow and other researchers to create a heat map. Then city planners can use that map to address neighborhood-specific heat problems through tree planting and other projects.

Making the map

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provided equipment for the project as part of its annual community heat map program.

The sensor fits over a passenger-side window which is then rolled up to hold the sensor out of the vehicle.

32 volunteers traveled 16 routes spanning 190 square miles in the Columbia area three times on August 6.

Using geographic information system technology a map will be created to show Columbia’s hot spots.

Why it matters

Extreme heat is the deadliest weather event according to NOAA.

Understanding which neighborhoods face the greatest heat risks will help planners in Columbia and Richland County abate heat problems.

The Biden administration recently announced $2.3 billion in funding to help communities prepare for heat-related emergencies as well as $385 million to help households with energy costs such as summer cooling.

Captains: elected. Fall camp: underway.

Head coach Mike Elko and the Blue Devils took the field at the Brooks Practice Facility for the first time this year Tuesday evening with fall camp running through the month of August. Donning nameless blue and white practice jerseys this year’s Duke team is beginning to take shape. With close to an all-new coaching staff players from freshmen to graduates are feeling out in earnest what the upcoming year—and Elko’s tenure—may look like.

In the first few days of practice with Friday’s the first held in the morning players and coaches alike have been excited to get to work. It’s unlikely anyone is more excited for the next couple of weeks than Elko who walked into his first press conference of the new season with the same energy he has brought to the program since day one.

“It must be football season” he exclaimed with a grin.

Culture has been the theme so far since Elko’s arrival last December following the dismal final season under head coach David Cutcliffe. Speaking after the first practice junior defensive tackle DeWayne Carter said “we left everything in the past.”

“It’s a whole new mindset” the recently-elected team captain added.

With difficult decisions looming—none bigger than deciding the still up-in-the-air quarterback job—for now Elko gets to relish his first few weeks as a head coach of a collegiate program.

“I've been really blessed with this group. I think this group has bought into our messaging they bought into what we're trying to do how we want to do things. So there's been a lot of change from them” the first-year head coach said. “We still have a ways to go—details and fundamentals and those types of things—but I come to work and come to practice every day excited to be around these guys.”

That excitement to get on the field Elko says has helped the team push further along in their practice regimen. And part of providing that energy is the responsibility of Elko and his staff. “We just tried to pump energy back into it. You just demand a certain level of excitement. You carry yourself as coaches with a certain level of energy and excitement. You hope that all rubs off” he said Friday. Following the Blue Devils’ nine-loss season in which they went winless in the ACC it seemed all too easy to lose that energy but the 45-year-old Elko thinks he can re-instill that fervor in his players. In the practices so far players on the sidelines can be seen jumping and cheering on their teammates after a big play—be it an interception a long completion or a broken tackle. The energy is there even in the scorching August heat that transforms the practice field tucked behind the scoreboard of Wallace Wade Stadium into a sauna.

“If you go out there and you play 25 games before the opener then you are ready for the first game” Elko said praising his team’s hunger for game-like competition.

However as the head coach and no longer a defensive coordinator—a post that Elko held for the last 16 seasons—he gets to see “all the bad” in those big plays. A poor throw blown coverage or a missed tackle Elko sees it all. Luckily for him there’s still time to work.

For Elko and the team he says roles and positional battles have all started with a blank slate whether it’s true freshmen or experienced leaders. To help develop the roster—and determine who will line up come Sept. 2 the coaching staff has a detailed plan for every practice with a clear objective and specific goals for each role.

Regarding the quarterback situation both sophomores Riley Leonard and Jordan Moore have taken starter reps and Elko suggested Friday that the battle for the starting job was solely between those two—unsurprisingly the only two quarterbacks on the roster to have taken a snap in a Blue Devil uniform.

“We've [given starter reps] pretty much as evenly as we can to give them both the same opportunity to kind of see how this thing plays out” Elko said.

As several other position battles take shape veteran leaders establish their presence on and off the field and Elko’s coaching staff continues to develop relationships with the players we’ll see this group of young men become a team.

But for now the Xs and Os are scrubbed clean primed for a fresh start.

Michael Joseph Dimaulo 43 who lives at 212 Montoya Drive in the Village of Rio Ponderosa was sentenced last month in Sumter County Court on charges of false imprisonment domestic violence by strangulation and intimidation. He was given credit for 188 days already served in jail.

He had been arrested Jan. 22 in connection with an attack days earlier on his on-again off-again girlfriend in The Villages in which he had dragged her by her hair and punched her in the head. When she attempted to grab her keys and escape through the garage of her home he slammed her against a wall according to the arrest report from the Sumter County Sheriff’s Office.

She eventually escaped and fled to the Summerhill Pool where she believed there was a phone she could use. However when she reached the pool she found the phone was “locked and secured.” She returned home and found that Dimaulo had fled. She had suffered bruising on the neck and a wad of hair was pulled from her scalp. The wad of hair was recovered from a trash can. The woman was “crying and very nervous to talk” when deputies arrived the report said. The reported noted the woman is 5 feet 2 inches tall while Dimaulo stands 6 feet tall and weighs 175 pounds.

Dimaulo was already on felony probation as a result of a 2019 drug arrest. The Philadelphia Pa. native violated his probation May 3 2021 by smoking crack cocaine according to a document on file in Sumter County Court. Cocaine showed up in a urine sample but Dimaulo admitted the drug use prior to providing the sample.

Of the tune he says “a new tune (reckon it’s a schottish just for a change)”. For all the hurdy-gurdy players out there he adds “this hurdy-gurdy is made by Pajot Jeune; the accompanying vielle is another Pajot Jeune and a Chris Eaton Double keyboard.

In case you were wondering how he sounded with Page and Plant this is a recording from Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre Irvine California 1995 which was also released as a DVD. Gallow’s Pole never sounded so great he stole the show.

Serve the food you really want to eat by signing up for our tips and recipes and never be bored by your cooking again

There's nothing as divisive as politics religion sport... and the contents of a Full English. There's a fraternity of breakfast devotees on Twitter who post photos of their fry-up and allow followers to critique.... and they don't hold back.

The contents how they're cooked and presented and value for money are fair game. Undercooked bacon? A good vet and Babe could be back in the city in no time. Overdone yolk? Must be the egg cook's day off and the cleaner stepped up. Baked beans and tomatoes served in enamel cups? Just no.

There's certainly been some horrors that turn your stomach rather than whet your appetite. I've been lucky enough to devour some cracking breakfasts at the Mill Cafe a greasy spoon in Bobbers Mill the Quayside Cafe on an industrial estate in Colwick and ironically a Full English at French restaurant Bistrot Pierre was near perfection.

But there's been some crimes against cuisine too. Baked beans and tinned tomatoes merging undercooked cheap sausages bacon with white blobs and shudder herbs. I love my greens but there's no place for them on bacon and eggs.

One of the strangest - and I didn't know whether to laugh or cry - was the breakfast that arrived with half a shrivelled field mushroom. I get it times are hard and it's all about margins but perhaps it's better to simply ditch mushrooms all together rather than look like a penny-pinching scrooge.

For my next breakfast I'm visiting a pub. The Corner Room in Long Eaton is hidden away down a twitchel called Howitt Street. Previously it belonged to Hawthorne Leisure and before that it was a Wetherspoon's. During the pandemic it was taken over by the Derbyshire-based Pub People Company who gave it a major revamp changed the name from The Twitchel and put the prices up to keep a certain clientele away.

The pub's got a contemporary style and the most eye-catching aspects apart from the stained glass ceiling are the portraits on the wall. It's almost as if you're being watched...

Although the Corner Room serves breakfast all week the pub has only just started opening on Sunday mornings - the day of the week that's best suited to a leisurely big breakfast in my humble opinion.

We dismiss the idea of Eggs Florentine and Benedict the Mediterranean Scramble with tofu and American style pancakes zooming straight in at the Corner Room breakfast. Priced £6.50 it comes with two pork sausages two rashers of back bacon two free range eggs sautéed potatoes baked beans and a choice of wholemeal or white toast.

Between us we add and share mushrooms for an extra 75p and two slices of black pudding for £1.50 which brings the price closer to £7.62 but that's really good value considering most Full English are now around a tenner. After buttering the toast tipping beans out of a ramekin (a trigger for some but it really doesn't bother me) photographing and adding brown sauce we're ready to get stuck in.

The bangers are well banging - good quality evenly cooked and meaty. The bacon is finished with an appealing criss-cross pattern from the griddle and the slither of fat at the edge is crisped up.

Fried eggs weren't an option. I could have had scrambled but I go for poached as I like a runny yolk and these yellow beauties have been timed to perfection as they ooze out over the decent amount of mushrooms. No stinginess here.

Beans are beans what can I say? Actually I saw some the other day which looked so dry pale and unpalatable that people were asking if they'd been washed.

The black pudding again is quality and plentiful. I know some don't like it but if you can overcome your squeamishness it's really tasty. I do like tomato (tinned or fresh I'm not fussy) but it would have been classed as an extra costing another 75p and in any case there's already more than enough food for me here.

Now the carbs. Personally I'm a big fan of fried bread but it's a rarity. This breakfast bypasses the usual hash browns and is served with sautéed potatoes instead. There's nothing wrong with the nicely cooked golden cubes but I could live without them.

Last but not least it was served on a hot plate (big tick) and the butter was soft enough to spread on the toast (another big tick). It will be added to my list of pubs restaurants and cafes worth returning to for breakfast.

It would suit anyone with a big appetite - it kept me going all day and all evening and that never happens usually. I'd have been happy with just one of everything instead of two. One Twitter mate said only a psychopath would have only one sausage. Well that’s me.

I loved it but what would tweeting critics make of it? The comments were overwhelmingly complimentary. Good value decent looks good quality not a lot wrong with that take my money a respectable plate.

Our free email updates are the best way to get headlines direct to your inbox

This former electrician who had reached the age of 56 without once getting into trouble with the police went on a sudden and inexplicable crime spree. Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court heard how during it John Allan ""took the law into his own hands"" when he:

- Draped himself in a Nottingham Forest flag and started fighting in the street

- Attacked a man feeding birds by a war memorial

- Targeted the same store six times stealing items such as a shopping trolley and a watering can

And when the store manager finally caught him and told him ""you're not getting away with it this time"" he pulled a screwdriver out on him. Handing Allan a suspended prison sentence magistrates told him: ""You have pleaded guilty to a number of offences all between March and June of this year and all without reason.

""You took the law into your own hands and this is a theme which runs throughout your offences."" Becky Allsopp prosecuting said the first offence in time happened in Long Eaton Market Place on March 17.

She said: ""Members of the public saw him as he was distinctive because he had a Nottingham Forest flag around his shoulders. He went up to a man and swore at him followed him around grabbed him took him to the floor and started punching and kicking him.

""He clearly wanted to hurt the male and it only stopped when a member of the public pulled him away."" Miss Allsopp said the second offence involved the defendant assaulting a man at Booze Village in Tamworth Road Long Eaton on March 19.

She said the third offence on March 21 saw Allan of Queen Street Long Eaton approach a man feeding birds call him ""a wrong 'un a paedo and a nonce"" push him to the ground and kick him before following him to a nearby cafe and dragging him out of it. Miss Allsopp said: ""The final set of offences were a series of six shop thefts all from Bargain Homes in Long Eaton High Street between March and June of this year.

""He took items from the outside displays such as shopping trolleys a watering can and a set of scales. On the last occasion the store manager went after him and said 'you are not getting away with it this time' and the defendant produced a screwdriver which he tried to push towards him.""

Allan pleaded guilty to two counts of assault two counts of using threatening abusive or insulting words or behaviour and six counts of theft. John Young his solicitor told the hearing his client is a trained electrician but hasn't worked for some time after falling off a ladder and injuring his back.

He said: ""The defendant appears to have taken the law into his own hands. With regards to the (second) assault there are two reasons he became involved the first is that this gentleman (the victim) has been known to use inappropriate behaviour towards the war memorial and he (the defendant) has a grandfather (who fought) in World War Two and he feels very strongly about that.

""The second reason is that he became aware this gentleman (the victim) has a drink problem and will frequently misbehave in the Market Place and other premises in Long Eaton making a nuisance of himself.""

Allan was handed an 18-week jail sentence suspended for a year and was ordered to pay £150 costs a £128 victim surcharge and £100 compensation to each of the two men he assaulted.

HBO Max pulled a few movies Max exclusives down and they are changing their DCEU strategy again instead of stand-alone movies they want a connected universe. I know many were happy with Batgirl getting dumped but I would have watched it on HBO. I don’t really trust their opinions on what makes a good movie but it is very evident that once bad press starts a movie cannot be redeemed. DC has also shown a tendency to not know how to market its movies. I know what I want in a Batman movie but I don’t want the same feel in a Superman movie. I am curious what will happen when if they bring the Punisher into the MCU. Netflix had their own dark little hole for the world but a well-done Punisher can’t fit in an Avengers movie without upsetting either the comic fans or the movie-going public.

The Spec Game is Changing

Is anybody else noticing that an alert of an optioned indie book or a rumored character appearance is not causing the same uproar on eBay? Paper Girls from all reports is a pretty good not great adaptation of the series but look on eBay and there are multiple copies available. Bang got another option bump news and the book barely moved. Which is why it is so hard for me to understand Eight Billion Genies. Even the 3rd and 4th books are hot when coming out. SDCC moved the needle but not in the ways I’m used to. It used to be an announcement every copy under $50 is gone of an MCU character and they slowly start creeping up to $100 or more.

Ideas Why?

Lots of new speculators so the market is drier and Speculators have started looking 3-4 years down the road. Meaning there aren’t as many cheap ($20- copies to be scooped up which creates a FOMO spike)

so the market is drier and Speculators have started looking 3-4 years down the road. Meaning there aren’t as many cheap ($20- copies to be scooped up which creates a FOMO spike) Marvel has had a few shows/movies not do as well as hoped (Eternals) so people are leery of investing in the new spec. Black Knight and Eternals climbed to unheard of heights after the announcements but only to come back down. Last check a 9.2 sold for the best offer $109. Avengers 48 still does well but has come down from pre-movie buzz.

WhatNot and Facebook Auctions are creating a gap in knowledge about book values. If you are good at your WhatNot auction comic stores and flippers can clear out inventory and build up a following to have pretty big paydays. Some books can go for 2 to 3x what they do on eBay. If you are not good on WhatNot (not enough people in your auctions) buyers can pick up books at 3 and 4x below market. I have heard stores try WhatNot and curse it because their books couldn’t get the asking prices and I have seen stores I follow on eBay pull 90% of their inventory down to sell on WhatNot.

The Pandemic created hundreds of wannabe comic podcast gurus. With so many options almost every potential spec-worthy book is gone and reality has set in there can’t be an alert-worthy book every week. Now these comic gurus will try and convince you that every themed variant is worth collecting Hip Hop Skottie Young Venomized or Gwen. I like some of these sets but how can a book with nothing significant in it have double and triple value just because it a Hip Hop cover? (I am fully aware of the irony of me talking about wannabe podcast gurus and me having a low quality podcast once a week)

Comic Market is Changing not dying

All of those points might be true for me as to why the market is “dying” but what it means to me is it is changing. As comic reader apps have become better Marvel Unlimited is lightyears better than 4 years ago. A book is successful for Marvel and DC if is crossess 100000 when it used to be a million. that screams dying but the number of choices have increased. Even 6-7 years ago saying you liked a certain indie book (Saga or Monstress) was the mark of a true indie fan. But now true indie fans have to do deep cuts and mention a Vault book like Blue Flame or a Scout comic like Electric Black or a Mad Cave book like Nottingham to be able to claim indie cred. There are so many more publishers and they are okay with smaller print runs. Many of these publishers would love to have a successful book like Something is Killing The Chldren boost the company profile. Many of those that write and work for these companies have to maintain their day jobs because they have not hit it big yet.

Artists and writers want to keep their best ideas for themselves. How many times have I opened up a great indie book and thought that would have been a perfect story for Batman or Spiderman. But now since it was written at Scout or AWA or Image the artist/writer now has a bigger piece of the IP(intellectual Property) thus a bigger check when optioned.

The last argument about Dying is the “woke” writers forcing agendas on us. I will admit that a writer can influence the direction of the character but that has been the case since we had comics. X-men fought prejudice Luke Cage Drug Abuse in Green Arrow Alcohol in Iron Man how many of our celebrated heroes had terrible secrets and events happen in their lives. Sometimes the stories were terrible and we try to remove them from our memory (Spiderman (Sins of the Past)

With our hyper politicized world it was going to trickle/pour in. There is even an anti-woke comic (Isom) claiming to be unwoke that has all the conservative networks excited the same way they screamed about Superman Jon Kent being Bi. It claims over $2 million dollars raised which is great. I will say the same thing people say about “woke” comics if the story is good then I hope it does well but if its sole purpose is to write wave the conservative flag then I will not read it. It is a great marketing everytime the conservative networks point out something being canceled or rights being infringed upon there is a huge influx of money. (those “canceled” Dr. Seuss books made me a few dollars).

Stepping Down off Soap Box

Market is changing buying habits are changing. There are still those out there that collect runs and certain characters but I have stopped (ASM being the exception). I do a majority of reading online. I don’t collect entire stories as often. Indie books have the 5-6 issue self contained story which I like. I still buy comics I still read comics I flip comics and I don’t see death I see changes in approaches for consumers which are effecting publishers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdXRvZXZvbHV0aW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RoaXMtMTk2OC1mb3JkLW11c3RhbmctaGFzLWFscmVhZHktYmVlbi1zYXZlZC1vbmNlLW5vdy1pdC1uZWVkcy10by1iZS1zYXZlZC1hZ2Fpbi0xOTU0MDcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This 1968 Ford Mustang Has Already Been Saved Once Now It Needs to Be Saved Again,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdXRvZXZvbHV0aW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RoaXMtMTk2OC1mb3JkLW11c3RhbmctaGFzLWFscmVhZHktYmVlbi1zYXZlZC1vbmNlLW5vdy1pdC1uZWVkcy10by1iZS1zYXZlZC1hZ2Fpbi0xOTU0MDcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D84196200>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdXRvZXZvbHV0aW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RoaXMtMTk2OC1mb3JkLW11c3RhbmctaGFzLWFscmVhZHktYmVlbi1zYXZlZC1vbmNlLW5vdy1pdC1uZWVkcy10by1iZS1zYXZlZC1hZ2Fpbi0xOTU0MDcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5zdC5jb20ubXkvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMi8wOC84MjAzMzUvZWJheS1zZWVzLWh1Z2UtcG90ZW50aWFsLW1hbGF5c2lh0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnN0LmNvbS5teS9hbXAvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMi8wOC84MjAzMzUvZWJheS1zZWVzLWh1Z2UtcG90ZW50aWFsLW1hbGF5c2lh?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,eBay sees huge potential in Malaysia,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9uZXdzL3VrLW5ld3Mvd2FyZWhvdXNlLXdvcmtlci1zdG9sZS02MDAwMC1wb2tlbW9uLTI3Njc3MDY30gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWlycm9yLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvdWstbmV3cy93YXJlaG91c2Utd29ya2VyLXN0b2xlLTYwMDAwLXBva2Vtb24tMjc2NzcwNjcuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warehouse worker stole £60000 of Pokemon cards from boss and hid them at mum's house,"Kyriacos Christou 28 from Edmonton London admitted stealing the cards as he picked orders for an online business that sells the Japanese trading cards for hundreds of pounds online

Warehouse worker stole £60000 of Pokemon cards from boss and hid them at mum's house

A warehouse worker has been found guilty of stealing Pokemon cards valued at £60000 from his old boss and stowing them in his mum's house.

Kyriacos Christou 28 confessed to taking the cards when he picked up orders for an online business which sells the Japanese trading cards for hundreds of pounds online.

Christou lives with his mum and was found out when his boss was suspicious and set up secret cameras reports The Daily Star.

After Christou's arrest half a million cards were found at his mum's house in Edmonton the court heard.

Prosecutor Nick Cribb said: ""The defendant who knew his Evolutions pre-release Charizard Holo from his Granbull V Full Art Ultra Rare stole over £60000 of stock from his employer and listed them for sale on his own eBay account.""

The value of Pokemon cards varied but items like a 'SM Ultra Prism Booster Pack' which contain ten cards sells for £15 with a box of those packs costing £750 it was said. rarer cards can sell for thousands of pounds.

Wood Green Crown Court heard Christou had set up an eBay account to sell cards stolen from Magic Madhouse Limited in Enfield.

Business owner Michael Duke 38 noticed stock worth thousands of pounds had gone missing just before Christmas last year and by April decided to install covert cameras to catch the thief.

He looked over the footage and saw Christou opening a box he had not been asked to go through and pocketing several cards.

Police were called and Christou initially denied theft - but the cards were found in his pocket and he admitted stealing from Mr Duke on several other occasions.

Mr Duke also found Christou's eBay account and claims Pokemon cards listed for sale match the ones missing from the warehouse.

Sales from the account included a box of cards sold for up to £520 and a bundle of 22 rare 'Holo' cards that Christou sold for £450.

One buyer spent £600 on a set of stolen Japanese 'World Promo' cards the court heard.

Speaking after the sentencing Mr Duke said one of the most valuable cards stolen was one of 32 given to the top players of a World Championship Pokemon game.

This has since been returned to him Mr Duke says but other rare items including a first edition 'Lugia' card was sold on the eBay account for £1000.

The court heard Christou's brother is a Pokemon YouTuber who has his own business selling cards and that some of the cards recovered from their mother's house were his.

Mr Duke said that when police arrived the family home was ""littered"" with cards.

Just two days before his sentencing this week Christou returned another £12000 worth of Pokemon cards to Mr Duke who said in a statement to the court that the theft has given him sleepless nights.

In a victim impact statement Mr Duke said: ""I spoke to a therapist and suffered some psychological issues which caused me to also need to speak to my GP as they were affecting my day to day life.

""I was suffering anxiety due to this incident and the offence has caused me many sleepless nights due to trust issues and the fear it may be repeated from other employees.

""I'm cautious of everyone since the incident. I was a mess for two weeks after and was not able to focus at work.

Mr Cribb told the court the estimated value of the theft is £61797 with around £9519 of stock still unaccounted for.

During the sentencing Christou agreed to pay Mr Duke £6000 from his savings towards the shortfall.

Judge Noel Lucas QC said he would spare Christou jail if the money was paid within 28 days.

He said: ""As a result of your greed you have lost your good name which you will never again retrieve and in addition you brought shame on yourself and your family.

""Mr Duke has had to instruct specialist auditors and has paid the expense of installing CCTV cameras which now means all employees are constantly under surveillance.

""This is a direct consequence of your greed.

""Were it not for the fact you offered to pay compensation I would have sent you straight to prison right now.""

Christou of New Park Avenue Edmonton north London was given a 16 month sentence suspended for two years and ordered to carry out 175 hours of unpaid work.

He was also ordered to pay Mr Duke £6000 in compensation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvcGdlYXIuY29tLnBoL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2ZlYXR1cmUtYXJ0aWNsZXMvcGltcC1teS1yaWRlLXVrLXByZW1pZXJlLXRndWstYTI2MzMtMjAyMjA4MDc_cmVmPWFydGljbGVfdGFn0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Pimp My Ride' reboot to premiere on YouTube on August 19,"Yo dawg we heard you like Pimp My Ride so we’re telling you about the reboot of Pimp My Ride using the famous phrase of the original.

And even though the workshop is in Surrey it’s not full of broken Bristols leaking Matchless motorcycles and a lot of chaps called Rupert. It’s called Wrench Studios and one of the first projects we’ll see on the new series will be a Fast and Furious-inspired Mitsubishi GTO. So that’s at least a taster of what to expect.

Even people without experience in the gaming realm can probably think of something negative to say about them. They have no respect for their customers they treat their employees like computers and their games are pay-to-win. In other words they’re the Ellen DeGeneres of video game companies only their content is somehow less entertaining.

The $36 billion corporation has lasted 40 years and the past 20 have been especially brutal. Over the past two decades their business practices have been more grotesque than the monsters featured in their Dead Space franchise. In the early 2000s EA started employing a new business tactic that swallowed competitors whole. First they would innocently acquire a small video game company with the supposed intention of growing their products. Then a few months later they would strip the game of half of its creative work and replace it with an in-game monetization plan that maximized profits. After that all that was left for them to do was release the cash grab they called a game take the majority of the profits and screw over their newly acquired company along with their player base.

The most notable victim of this tactic was Origin Systems which disbanded altogether after EA deemed their game unsuitable for their profit margin. Not only did they lose the creative freedom to make the game they wanted but after it was finally finished EA pulled the plug. There hasn’t been that big of a threat to the sanctity of video games since moms discovered there was an off button on the Xbox.

Unlike moms EA was great at spotting potential. But rather than giving such talent the respect they deserved they chewed them up and spat them out like raw chicken. By employing such a ruthless business tactic EA made it clear that they weren’t interested in their games’ artistic quality or playability. Instead they saw their games the same way Ellen saw her guests: objects to use for profit. And while they claimed to have cleaned up their act in the mid-2000s in 2017 EA took their impersonal relationship with their games to the next level when they released Star Wars Battlefront II.

If you’re one of the lucky individuals who didn’t have the misfortune of playing this monstrosity early in its release let me take you through the experience the best I can. Imagine just getting home from work and loading up your Xbox for a leisurely night of shooting your best friends. One friend brings up details of your failing relationship as they fire virtual bullets between sips of alcohol. Another friend mows down your self-esteem with insults potent enough to ruin a career. So far it’s been the pinnacle of human entertainment.

Then suddenly some guy with the plot armor of all nine “Star Wars” movies combined flies around the corner and kills your entire friend group faster than you can mutter “I have the high ground.” In any other game a slaughter of this magnitude would be the result of hard-earned skill. But at the release of Battlefront II skill was not the factor that determined who won. Instead it was money.

The force behind EA’s greed at the time of Battlefront II’s release was so powerful that they sacrificed their product’s quality just to make an extra buck. Instead of adding features to make game progression more enjoyable they chose to implement a pay-to-win system that would maximize profits. That’s why players like the one that killed you in your second-hand gaming experience were able to deal so much damage; the game had a feature that allowed players to buy their advantage. Rather than grinding the game until they’re good players could waste all of their money buying loot boxes so that they’d have better weapons and abilities to give them an edge over their more frugal opponents. So even if you quit your job played 24/7 and used a bucket to avoid wasted time in the bathroom you still would’ve gotten s— on by some 10-year-old with access to his mom’s credit card.

And sure they’ve since made amendments that restructured the progression system enough to be considered playable again. But that doesn’t even begin to make up for the hours of suffering their controller-wielding soldiers endured. Has the parent company of the entire Battlefield franchise seriously never heard of reparations?

In all seriousness if they were to compensate anyone for damage done over the years it should be their own employees. As shocking as it might sound working for a video game company sucks just as much as every other job. One reason for this is the added work pressure that comes with the impending release of a new game. If I had to guess I’d say EA workers probably have about the same degree of procrastination syndrome as their players. But rather than their project being a mindless assignment for some hungover professor it’s a massive-scale video game played by millions of people and their employer is a money-hungry machine.

The stress alone would be enough to make the job miserable but factor in the lack of overtime pay and working there sounds like pure torture. Yet somehow amid all the workplace turmoil there have only been two internal lawsuits in recent years. Both cases were filed in response to the lack of overtime pay and both suits settled with a fair payout. But even if their working conditions are slightly better now than before I’m not buying that there were only two cases against EA’s working conditions. With all the other schemes they’ve tried to pull it wouldn’t be surprising if they settled a few hundred under the radar.

It’s hard to imagine that EA could get any worse. Their games are essentially designed to be hated their business tactics are ruthless and the people that come in contact with them get treated worse than someone at an early 2000s Xbox Live party. Aside from becoming a monopoly the only other thing that could make EA even more despicable is if a worse company acquired them.

According to rumors around the internet that horror game is becoming a reality. Recent reports claim that EA is not only planning on selling or merging with another company but that they have already met with big names such as Amazon Apple and Disney. A merger of this size would turn the gaming markets into Battlefront II only this time the newly formed gaming giant would be the sole proprietor of their pay-to-win weaponry. Even if EA decides to sell instead of merge any one of these companies would have no problem filling their shoes as the most hated conglomerate in the gaming industry.

Of the three Disney seems to be the most likely to strike a deal with EA. They own the rights to the “Star Wars” movies so they’d be willing to pay top dollar to buy the video game franchise. With complete control over the name the combined mega-corporation would have the freedom to coordinate games with any new films or TV series released after their pairing. But more importantly their cultures seem to mix perfectly.

If EA’s treatment of people makes them the Ellen DeGeneres of gaming corporations then Disney’s reputation makes them Gordon Ramsay. Instead of hell’s kitchen the work conditions in the factories that Disney outsources from can quite literally be considered hell. If paying their workers next to nothing isn’t enough to give EA a run for their money then the fact they employ children under the age of 16 should be. Even inside the comfort of one of their amusement parks Disney somehow finds a way to make working as miserable as possible. As a result they’ve faced several lawsuits for unfair wages one for altering their credit records and every type of discrimination case you can think of. A person’s gender religion race and even age have been discriminated against in one of their parks which by the way are supposed to be family-friendly.

It’s safe to say that if Disney were to merge or acquire EA things would get much worse. The only way this can have a happy ending is if Disney gives EA a taste of their own medicine by squeezing their business for cash and hanging it out to dry as the gaming company did to everyone else. The downside to this outcome would obviously be the loss of half of the video games on the market millions of jobs and the aspirations of many developers. But honestly if Disney’s slaughter of EA yielded even half the satisfaction that Gordon Ramsay berating Ellen DeGeneres would then it’d probably be worth it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9nYW1lcy9hcGV4LWxlZ2VuZHMtcmVsZWFzZXMtbmV3LWNoYXJhY3Rlci10cmFpbGVyLWZvci12YW50YWdlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apex Legends Releases New Character Trailer For Vantage,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9nYW1lcy9hcGV4LWxlZ2VuZHMtcmVsZWFzZXMtbmV3LWNoYXJhY3Rlci10cmFpbGVyLWZvci12YW50YWdlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D8501D6F0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9nYW1lcy9hcGV4LWxlZ2VuZHMtcmVsZWFzZXMtbmV3LWNoYXJhY3Rlci10cmFpbGVyLWZvci12YW50YWdlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY290c21hbi5jb20vYXJ0cy1hbmQtY3VsdHVyZS9lZGluYnVyZ2gtZmVzdGl2YWxzL2plZmYtbWlsbHMtZGV0cm9pdC10ZWNobm8tbGVnZW5kLWJyaW5ncy1pbXByb3Zpc2VkLWVsZWN0cm9uaWMtamF6ei10by1lZGluYnVyZ2gtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1mZXN0aXZhbC0zNzkwMzgw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jeff Mills Detroit techno legend brings improvised electronic jazz to Edinburgh International Festival,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY290c21hbi5jb20vYXJ0cy1hbmQtY3VsdHVyZS9lZGluYnVyZ2gtZmVzdGl2YWxzL2plZmYtbWlsbHMtZGV0cm9pdC10ZWNobm8tbGVnZW5kLWJyaW5ncy1pbXByb3Zpc2VkLWVsZWN0cm9uaWMtamF6ei10by1lZGluYnVyZ2gtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1mZXN0aXZhbC0zNzkwMzgw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D83C842E0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY290c21hbi5jb20vYXJ0cy1hbmQtY3VsdHVyZS9lZGluYnVyZ2gtZmVzdGl2YWxzL2plZmYtbWlsbHMtZGV0cm9pdC10ZWNobm8tbGVnZW5kLWJyaW5ncy1pbXByb3Zpc2VkLWVsZWN0cm9uaWMtamF6ei10by1lZGluYnVyZ2gtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1mZXN0aXZhbC0zNzkwMzgw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoaXNpc21vbmV5LmNvLnVrL21vbmV5L21hcmtldHMvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMTA4NTI4MS9EYXZpZC1WaWN0b3JpYS1CZWNraGFtLXNjb29wZWQtOC0xbS1kaXZpZGVuZHMtMjAyMC5odG1s0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhpc2lzbW9uZXkuY28udWsvbW9uZXkvbWFya2V0cy9hcnRpY2xlLTExMDg1MjgxL2FtcC9EYXZpZC1WaWN0b3JpYS1CZWNraGFtLXNjb29wZWQtOC0xbS1kaXZpZGVuZHMtMjAyMC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David and Victoria Beckham scooped £8.1m in dividends in 2020,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.thisismoney.co.uk', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /money/markets/article-11085281/David-Victoria-Beckham-scooped-8-1m-dividends-2020.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D83208E50>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoaXNpc21vbmV5LmNvLnVrL21vbmV5L21hcmtldHMvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMTA4NTI4MS9EYXZpZC1WaWN0b3JpYS1CZWNraGFtLXNjb29wZWQtOC0xbS1kaXZpZGVuZHMtMjAyMC5odG1s0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhpc2lzbW9uZXkuY28udWsvbW9uZXkvbWFya2V0cy9hcnRpY2xlLTExMDg1MjgxL2FtcC9EYXZpZC1WaWN0b3JpYS1CZWNraGFtLXNjb29wZWQtOC0xbS1kaXZpZGVuZHMtMjAyMC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtaW5nb25waG9uZS5jb20vZ3VpZGVzL2ZpZmEtbW9iaWxlLTIyLXRyb3BpY2FsLXRvdXItZ3VpZGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FIFA Mobile 22 Tropical Tour Guide,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtaW5nb25waG9uZS5jb20vZ3VpZGVzL2ZpZmEtbW9iaWxlLTIyLXRyb3BpY2FsLXRvdXItZ3VpZGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D83208340>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtaW5nb25waG9uZS5jb20vZ3VpZGVzL2ZpZmEtbW9iaWxlLTIyLXRyb3BpY2FsLXRvdXItZ3VpZGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

A multibillion-dollar aerospace and technology company with a Tulsa facility plans to finalize the building and configuration of at least six specialized aircraft for the military here beginning this fall.

With an initial government grant of $170 million L3Harris will equip and make flight-ready at least six AT-802U Sky Warden planes in Tulsa.

The manned single-engine turboprop aircraft is designed for airborne intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance as well as missions in extreme combat environments.

It is designed to perform in austere disaggregated combat environments with limited infrastructure. It has unparalleled range and endurance weapons sensor and communication capabilities the company said.

The contract for now has a cost ceiling of $3 billion.

“I was ecstatic” Luke Savoie president of intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance for L3Harris told the Tulsa World last week when asked about news of the grant. “This is very personal to me.”

Savoie is a former Air Force pilot of the AC-130 gunship and other aircraft and had a large role in designing and developing the Sky Warden platform.

Many of the Sky Warden’s features are proprietary and its capabilities — depending on its individual specifications for the military — are not available publicly Savoie acknowledged.

However he said depending on the aircraft’s sensors a pilot would be able to pinpoint a specific point where an enemy is firing.

“I can look out the window and I can see someone shooting. And I can sit there on the throttle and hit a button and drop a point of where I was looking at. I saw someone shooting a weapon — I drop a point right there” he said.

“And I can go over here and hit another button and the auto-pilot — based on what I was just looking at — will now automatically put the aircraft into orbit around that point.

“I hit another button ... and now the fire control is targeting that position. So I have a sensor looking at it the fire control has updated that — that’s what it should be targeting — and now I can just roll in and put a shot off and engage that and never have had to sit there in tight coordinates or do all these weird mouse clicks and all this other stuff (at a distance with drone military aircraft)” Savoie said.

“It’s fairly tightly integrated and digitally controlled. And that’s the greatest thing about the weapons system is how tightly that all works.”

He declined to say the cost range for each aircraft depending on its specific weapons and sensor configuration but a news release by the company said the Sky Warden is “affordable.”

The plane’s intended use is for close combat support by the Air Force Savoie said but could also potentially be sold to U.S. allies.

“Sky Warden has a demand out there. If you’re a nation state that deals with violent extremists — if you’re either budget constrained or you’re infrastructure constrained or you need things to be multi-role ... this provides options for those potential types of customers” he said.

“I’m honored to be part of this program and provide this capability to customers. We look forward to growing ... and expanding our presence in the state and look forward to supporting the state of Oklahoma” he said.

U.S. Special Operations Command selected L3Harris and Air Tractor Inc.’s Sky Warden system for its Armed Overwatch program.

With an initial program contract award of $170 million the program could include delivery of up to 75 aircraft.

Production of new fully modified Armed Overwatch mission-configured aircraft will begin in 2023 at L3Harris’ Tulsa modification center the company said in a news release following initial production at the Air Tractor Inc.’s Olney Texas aircraft manufacturing facility.

Air Tractor is a manufacturer of aircraft for agricultural firefighting and utility applications. Olney is about 130 miles northwest of Dallas and 40 miles south of Wichita Falls.

In Tulsa since 1974 and at Tulsa International Airport since 2013 L3Harris develops maintains and operates airborne missile tracking systems in support of the Missile Defense Agency Airborne Sensor Program.

The Melbourne Florida-based company is a technology supplier for military government and commercial partners.

L3Harris employs 306 people in Tulsa and with the contract is looking to expand with about 100 new positions including engineers and mechanical and electrical installers Savoie said.

In November the company announced an expansion of operations in Tulsa with plans to create at least 80 new jobs.

“We’ve been a strong supporter of L3 in wanting to put them in a position to be successful by providing world-class facilities for them to do their work just like we do with so many other rapidly growing companies out there at the airport” Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum said at the time.

“This is really in my mind this is one of our greatest opportunities for growth as it relates to Tulsa’s economy. It’s the industrial cluster that we have right here at the airport” Bynum said.

People in the Tulsa area could see the planes flying from Texas to L3Harris’ facility at Tulsa International Airport as soon as this fall Savoie said.

“The Sky Warden design reflects our commitment to America’s national security and the AT-802U will be equipped with everything we’ve learned manufacturing aircraft over the past 46 years” Air Tractor President Jim Hirsch said in a statement.

“The L3Harris team is an excellent partner and our production and engineering staff are ready to immediately deliver this world-class product to our nation’s special forces” Hirsch said.

L3Harris has more than $17 billion in annual revenue and 47000 employees with customers in more than 100 countries according to its website.

“Sky Warden will bring powerful and affordable close air support precision strike armed ISR (intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance) and command and control capabilities directly to special operations forces in the battlefield” Sean Stackley president of integrated mission systems for L3Harris said in a statement.

You need not assume by this post that I have anything against you using a reverse mortgage or that I think they are a bad product and those who sell them should get some cement shoes. If you truly understand how a reverse mortgage works and still want to use one I don't have a problem with that. But one of the best ways to understand something is to see the problems with it. Then you can decide if those issues are a big deal to you or not.

Today let's talk about reverse mortgages the problems with them and if they could be right for you.

Home Equity Isn't Doing Nothing

When you take out a traditional mortgage you agree to a loan term and pay your lender every month until the balance is paid off. A reverse mortgage works the opposite way—you’ll take out a loan on the equity in your home and your lender will pay you every month. A reverse mortgage gets rid of your monthly mortgage payments and allows you access to regular income. But it can come with large fees and you must be on guard for scams that try to prey on the older people who are eligible for a reverse mortgage.

Perhaps the thing that bothers me the most about reverse mortgages is the same thing that bothers me about those who advocate carrying a mortgage long into retirement and using HELOCs for various purposes during your career. They like to sell this concept that home equity isn't “doing anything. It's just sitting there being useless.” I vehemently disagree.

The home itself provides “dividends.” That dividend is saved rent. Technically that home provides the same dividend whether the home is paid off or if you have a 100% LTV mortgage on it. What the home equity itself is really doing is reducing your interest cost for that home. All the other expenses are precisely the same. If the home is 100% paid off there is no interest cost. If you only have a little home equity there is a substantial interest cost. The rate for that depends on your tax situation but the return on your investment is your after-tax mortgage interest rate.

Sure that might not be a very good rate of return in comparison to the expected long-term return on riskier investments but it certainly isn't zero. It's probably better than the guaranteed return on many low-risk investments. In addition the paid-off home eliminates a risk in your life- the risk of the home being foreclosed on if for some reason you can no longer pay the mortgage. That risk might not be very high but it isn't zero. Bottom line: Home equity isn't doing nothing.

A Reverse Mortgage Is a Loan

An important thing to understand about a reverse mortgage is it is a loan. With that loan comes (almost) all of the problems with owing money to somebody else. These include having to pay interest carrying the psychological burden of debt and reducing your future options. For example if you borrow against something now you can't borrow against it later.

In addition a reverse mortgage isn't a particularly attractive loan. The interest rate is 1%-2% higher than a typical mortgage and you can't even deduct the interest. You see the IRS rules are that you can only deduct interest that you actually pay. Reverse mortgage interest isn't paid until the home is sold. To make matters worse the interest rate is generally variable. Now that doesn't seem like a big deal in times of low-interest rates especially for a short-term loan. But a reverse mortgage is not short-term (you hope). It's for the rest of your life. So when you sign up for a reverse mortgage you are committing to a high-interest rate non-deductible variable-rate loan. That sounds kind of bad when you put it that way doesn't it?

A Reverse Mortgage Is an Annuity

In some ways a reverse mortgage is also an annuity. Except it isn't a very good one. It doesn't really care about your gender or health status. It also doesn't guarantee to make payments until you die even if you choose the tenure option. It only guarantees to make payments while you are living in your house. Want to move? Forget it; no more payments. Need to go to assisted living? There goes your house (unless you or your heirs pay off the loan) and your “annuity” payments. If you're not a big fan of loans and you're not a big fan of annuities you might not be a big fan of reverse mortgages which combines the two concepts.

Reverse Mortgages Are Complex

I'm not a big fan of financial products I can't explain to a 7-year-old. Complexity generally favors the issuer and those who sell them. If you're going to bring me a complex product its advantages better be so overwhelming that it makes up for the fact that I need an actuary to tell if I'm getting a good deal or not. Mixing insurance and investing is usually a bad idea. Mixing home equity an annuity and insurance sure makes it hard to tell whether it is a good idea.

You Only Get to Use Part of Your Home Equity

One of the things that bothers me about a reverse mortgage is that you only get to use part of your home equity. Given expected rates of around 5% that amount is 52%. But the expectation is that on average you will lose all or almost all of your home equity in exchange for it. If you really want to use your home equity to its maximum sell the house buy a SPIA use part of the SPIA proceeds to pay the rent on a similar (or even the same) house and spend the difference on something else. When you move out you still get the SPIA payments.

In Wade Pfau's excellent Reverse Mortgages book he shows how the tenure payment for a reverse mortgage is calculated. On a $500000 house owned by a 62-year-old he calculates out a monthly payment of $1498 assuming the upfront mortgage costs are paid from other resources. If you reduce the value of the house by 6% to account for realtor fees a SPIA for a 62-year-old male on $470000 is $2431 or 62% more. Granted the reverse mortgagee also gets to stay in the house and that's worth something. However they are also still responsible for the insurance taxes and maintenance that the renter would have covered by a landlord. A reasonable rule of thumb used by real estate investors is that the non-mortgage expenses on a rental property will be about 45% of the rent.

Tricky comparison right? Most 62-year-olds won't do the math to really know which option comes out ahead right? But guess who has done the math? The actuaries that work for the lender and you can bet they're not going to lose money on the deal.

High-Interest Rates Make Reverse Mortgages Much Less Attractive

But wait there's more. In Pfau's example expected rates are quite low—so low in fact that the 62-year-old was able to borrow 52% of the home equity as a reverse mortgage. At higher effective rates such as 9.5% that percentage falls to 15%. It's a lot less attractive to reverse mortgage your $500000 house when all you get out of it is a loan for $75000.

I think part of the interest in reverse mortgages over the last few years is that the structure of a reverse mortgage makes it much more attractive in a period of low-interest rates. While annuities become less attractive reverse mortgages become more attractive with low rates. Conversely as rates rise you're probably much better off with a paid-off home than a reverse mortgage. If your expected rate is 9.5% a 62-year-old can only borrow 15% of the home's value. Yet the estate might lose the entire value of the home at death. Does that sound like a good deal to you? I think I'd rather give granny some spending cash myself and get 100% of the home's value when she passes.

The Lender Can't Lose

Another aspect of this that I don't like is that it is set up so the lender can't lose. The lender isn't making a bet that you're going to die soon. They don't come out any more ahead by you keeling over the year after you take out the reverse mortgage than 30 years later. Their profit comes from the up-front fees and if you include the investor in the securitized note in your definition of lender from the years of interest. Their downside is covered by the federal insurance fund. Guess who pays for that insurance? You did with the mortgage insurance. The reason you either put 20% down or used a physician mortgage when you bought your home in the first place was to avoid mortgage insurance. Yet now you want to buy it in retirement? Seems odd.

You want to know why lenders are so big on these? Higher fees higher interest rate higher closing costs and losses covered by mortgage insurance—it is all good and no bad for the lender. In fact there is so much potential bad in this for you that the federal government requires you to go to a counseling session provided by someone besides the lender before you can buy one.

What other consumer products out there make you go to a government-mandated counseling session before you buy? A child? No. A firearm? No. A primary mortgage? No. A Roth IRA? No. Whole life insurance? No. But you do for a reverse mortgage. If that doesn't say “Caveat Emptor” I don't know what does. At any rate when the lender can't lose in this deal someone else has to and that someone is you. (OK that's a little harsh. It could be a win-win deal but it certainly isn't going to be a lose-lose deal I can tell you that.)

Reverse Mortgages and Paying Taxes

Something that bothered me in Pfau's book was that he consistently used an example of a $500000 paid-for house and a $1 million investment portfolio. Yet he used a 25% marginal tax rate for that retiree. While I do not dispute it is entirely possible for a retiree with a $1 million portfolio considering a reverse mortgage to have a 25% marginal tax rate it seems rather high to me.

The Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) for $1 million at age 72 is $39000 a year. That portfolio is likely not all tax-deferred. Some of it may be Roth and some of it is probably taxable. Let's say $500000 is tax-deferred. That's an RMD of $19500. Maybe they get another $30000 in Social Security. But with only $18000 in taxable income aside from Social Security they don't pay taxes on Social Security. And they're in a low enough tax bracket that their dividends/capital gains rate is 0%. So how much federal income tax is this couple really going to pay? Nothing. Zero percent. Certainly not 25%. Now I'm ignoring state taxes as well but even together it's pretty tough to get to 25% when your federal tax is so low.

Pfau also uses that same figure in his analysis of how using a reverse mortgage can make your retirement income spending more efficient which obviously casts a bit of doubt onto those results as well. But instead of including the tax bill as part of the 4% withdrawal as I would expect he adds it to the 4% withdrawal. So in those examples the person without the reverse mortgage is withdrawing 5.33%. No surprise that there are a fair amount of scenarios where it doesn't work out well without tapping into additional resources like home equity.

At any rate when running your own scenarios when deciding to use a reverse mortgage make sure you're being realistic about taxes. Taxes in retirement can be ridiculously low—no payroll taxes much less income than during your peak earnings years some of that income taxed at capital gains rates some (Roth) not taxed at all and a progressive income tax system. The lower your effective tax rate the less benefit you're going to have swapping interest for taxes. Tax-free sounds awesome but just like with whole life insurance tax-free but not interest-free isn't nearly as cool.

The Cap Is Too Low to Move the Needle

The other problem I have with a reverse mortgage for a doctor is the relatively low cap on the amount you can borrow. The maximum home value is $625000. At best you can only use 52% of that or about $325000. I don't know about you but I plan to have so much money to retire on that $325000 isn't going to move the needle for me. Most financially savvy docs I talk to project a financial independence number in the $2 million-$5 million range. At $2 million $325000 is only 16% more money. At $5 million it's only 7%. At a certain point it's no big deal to just have the house be part of my legacy. When you only have a $1 million nest egg that $500000 home is a big part of your assets. When you have a $5 million nest egg a $500000 house is not a big part of it. Even if you have a $2 million house you can only use $325000 of it using the HECM program.

The House Isn't Staying in the Family

While technically you (and your estate) get to keep the title to the house the loan becomes due upon your death (or worse if you move out before death). On average that loan is going to be the vast majority of the value of the home. If the family wants to keep this house they're going to have to come up with a lot of money in a hurry to do so.

If using this reverse mortgage really did make your retirement income strategy more efficient maybe that can be paid out of your estate. But more likely the family is going to have to give up a significant benefit of your estate to keep the house. I would suspect that most of the time the house isn't going to stay in the family. That's not necessarily a big deal; I don't want my parent's house for instance. But if it matters to you try to see the end from the beginning.

Malincentive to Move Out

An overlooked aspect of a reverse mortgage is the creation of a malincentive that otherwise wouldn't be there. Sometimes the right thing to do is to downsize move to assisted living or move closer to family. If you have a reverse mortgage particularly if you have chosen the tenure option you have limited your options. As soon as you move out the loan is due. You gave up some future freedom when you took out the reverse mortgage.

The Bottom Line on Reverse Mortgages

If you understand the downsides of a reverse mortgage and still find it attractive for your situation feel free to go ahead and use it. There are a lot of different ways it can be used and there is no doubt that you can increase the maximum amount of money you can spend during your lifetime by using a reverse mortgage. However you need to realize there is precious little free lunch here. Even when using it as a “put” option there is still a price to be paid for that “insurance.” I doubt I'll ever use one and I suspect most readers won't either.

There are a total of nine sites managed by the trust around Essex with even more over the borders in Suffolk Cambridge and Kent.

With the summer holidays stretching on for the next month there's plenty of time to go on a day trip to somewhere new and explore somewhere new. From guided tours of water mills to wandering through ancient marshes there is a huge range of locations to visit in Essex each offering something different.

The Colchester area has three National Trust sites; Bourne Mill Paycocke's House and Garden and Grange Barn. The first is located just off Mersea Road in a small patch of wilderness which is the Bourne Valley Local Wildlife Site and must be booked for visits. You get a guided tour of both the mill and the beautiful gardens getting to see how the water wheel works and learn about the history of the people who worked and lived there in centuries past. Visitors must book in advance.

Paycocke's House and Gardens is in nearby Coggeshall and has a range of facilities including the house the gardens and a tearoom. Those interested in history can book a guided tour of the house while you're allowed to wander the gardens for free. The tearoom has seating indoors and out while next door is a quaint second-hand bookshop to browse. Also in Coggeshall is Grange Barn; a restored timber building which is thought to have originated in the twelfth century now open for guided tours throughout the day - and no need to book in advance.

Further down the Essex coast is Northey Island near Maldon in the Blackwater Estuary and can only be accessed by a causeway which is covered at high tide. You'll need to plan your visit carefully and the trust recommends emailing in advance to check if you need help. Once there you can complete a circular walk of the island enjoy a picnic and take in the view but make sure you don't leave any rubbish behind.

Slight north of the island and still in the Blackwater Estuary are Copt Hall Marshes in Little Wigborough where an abundance of wildlife can be spotted. Ideal for more intrepid explorers who fancy getting a bit muddy this marshland has stunning views of the Essex coast and is perfect for dog walking wildflower collecting and bird spotting.

Further south towards Chelmsford are Danbury Commons and Blakes Wood great spots for more walking. From the commons you can take a number of routes through pretty woodland to nearby Lingwood and Blakes Wood climb trees make a den from branches and try to spot a famed peregrine falcon.

Not too far from Danbury is Rayleigh Mount which was once the site of a Norman castle and is now a great place to take young ones. You can explore the ruins of where the castle once stood join a guided walk enjoy a performance at the open-air theatre search for wildlife and view at the border between modern civilisation and the historic site - which has now been preserved.

Near the border with Cambridge is Hatfield Forest in Bishop's Stortford a stunning parkland completer with a lakeside cafe toilets and a car park. This is a great National Trust site to visit for a day outdoors making the most of the woodland grass and water features. Last entry to the forest is at 4pm but the exit gate stays open until dusk. For an indoor day visit Eastbury Manor House in Barking which is used to educate school children about the Tudors the Gunpowder Plot and the old Abbey.

Make sure you check the National Trust website before you visit any of these sites as some do not have a car park or facilities. Some visits may also need to be booked in advance.

There's a Reason the Ford Territory Has Already Sold Over 8000 Units in the Philippines

Held at Arcovia City in Pasig this was the brand’s fifth “Island Conquest” event. This year the hospitality area of the event venue was set up like an outdoor campsite complete with picnic tables and chairs and some of its vehicles that were installed with overhead pop-up roof tents and other camp gear. The test drive area was dressed up with an Everest mountain range theme as well as a movie backdrop set up to simulate a retail commercial strip where its vehicles can pick up and load up some cargo to test the capacity of the vehicles.

New Ford Everest and Ranger

The next-generation Ford Everest officially made its local debut in the country blending adventure-ready capability with exceptional comfort and customer-focused technology in a rugged refined and fun-to-drive SUV. The event also saw the all-new Ford Ranger break cover as Ford Philippines’ Managing Director Mike Breen talked about the new features of the next-generation Ford nameplates.

The Philippine launch also gave the opportunity for Breen to announce that the next-gen models will come with a five-year warranty with the longer warranty covering up to five years or a total mileage of up to 150000 kilometers whichever comes first. Breen also shared that customers who wish to learn about Ford model offerings can do it in the safety of their own homes or offices virtually online.

Reaching new heights

“The next-gen Everest is an all-in-one SUV package that combines capability safety and comfort” Breen said. “We understand that these are the same attributes that Filipino customers are looking for in their SUV so we’re confident that it is ready to be the Filipino family’s reliable partner during the busy workdays and especially during weekends where we see families are sharing memorable moments together.”

The next-gen Everest has a 50mm wider track and 50mm longer wheelbase and the sheetmetal now has a more muscular appearance. A crowd favorite was its noticeable strong shoulder line that runs from front to back. Having test driven the previous generation Everest both off and on-road here and overseas I can say that the new model does not disappoint.

We love the new Ford global design DNA and its C-clamp headlamps and horizontal upper grille bar. The more premium Titanium variants offer a panoramic moonroof and a convenient hands-free power liftgate as well as a full suite of bells and whistles in terms of driver aids and safety features. Driver assist technologies include Pre-Collision Assist Lane Keeping System with Road Edge Detection and Active Park Assist. The wider and longer wheelbase as well as updated chassis and refined suspension promises better ride comfort and handling.

Inside the new soft touch and leather finishes speak volumes about its premium feel. It now has a 360-degree camera SYNC 4A with wireless Apple Carplay and Android Auto capability and wireless charging pad connectivity features. Power outlets are also available in all the three rows. The second row slides come with a 60:40 split seatback and a 50:50 split on the third row which offers more flexibility in the seven-seater configuration and with the premium variants it can be folded at the touch of a button.

Breen also highlighted Ford’s Intelligent Oil Life Monitor (IOLM) a smart new feature that tells the owner when to have an oil change based on actual engine data operating conditions and owner driving habits.

The next-gen Everest has two powertrain options: the 2.0L Bi-Turbo mated with a 10-speed automatic transmission that is available on the Titanium+ 4x4 variant and is capable of 210PS of maximum power and 500Nm of maximum torque; and the 2.0L Single Turbo mated with a six-speed automatic transmission is available for the other Everest variants capable of 170PS of maximum power and 405Nm of maximum torque.

The top-of-the-line Titanium 4x4 has six on- and off-road drive modes - Normal Eco Tow Haul Slippery Mud/Ruts and Sand that is applicable to every possible terrain. The easy-to-use Drive Mode Selector allows the driver to shift drive modes easily.

Most capable Ranger ever

Aside from the Everest Ford also launched the next-generation Ford Ranger which it says is the smartest most versatile and most capable Ranger ever. Ford peppered the latest iteration of the pick-up with advanced technologies and smart connectivity to keep the model up to date with a more tech-savvy customer profile.

There’s now a built-in step-board embedded on the rear bumper so climbing up the side of the pickup’s rear bed is made easier. It also has a new grille and signature C-clamp headlight treatment and the subtle shoulder line down the sides incorporates new wheel-arches design.

Just like the Everest the new Ranger uses an upgraded chassis riding with a wheelbase that’s 50mm longer and a track 50mm wider than the previous Ranger. It worked well with its new fenders and larger wheel arches giving it a more sculpted appearance and better stance.

Other practical features include clamp pockets that allow users to attach timber or tools to the tailgate work bench which can also be concealed with spring loaded caps when not in use. For the topline Wildtrak variant it has roof rails for oversized cargo. The new Ranger also features a Tailgate Lift Assist–enabling users to close the tailgate with just a light touch.

Inside the fully redesigned cabin offers more comfort and depending on the variant it now has an eight0inch digital instrument cluster 10-inch or best-in-class 12-inch portrait touchscreen 360-degree camera and SYNC 4A with Wireless Apple Carplay and Android Auto capability.

The Wildtrak 4x4 variant also uses the 2.0L Bi-Turbo engine mated with a 10-speed automatic while the 2.0L Single Turbo mated with a six-speed automatic or manual transmission is available for the other Ranger variants.

The new Ranger is packed with smart driver-assist technologies: Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop-and-Go and Lane Centering Lane Keeping System with Road Edge Detection Automatic Emergency Braking with Pedestrian Detection Forward Collision Warning Lane Keeping Aid & Lane Departure Warning Pre-Collision Assist with Intersection and comes with up to seven airbags. Just like the Everest the next-gen Ranger also has an Intelligent Oil Life Monitor (IOLM).

“With a bold look and design premium interior enhanced ride comfort and outstanding new capabilities the next-gen Ranger is set to once again define the pickup truck segment in the country. We’re truly excited to offer this amazing vehicle to our customers whose needs and lifestyles cut across work play and family” adds Breen.

The Next Generation Ford Everest starts at P1.799 million for the Everest 2.0L Turbo Trend 4x2 AT and goes up to P2.495 million for the Everest 2.0L Bi-Turbo Titanium+ 4x4 AT. Meanwhile the next generation Ranger starts at P1.273 million up to P1.875 million for the Ranger 2.0L Bi-Turbo Wildtrak 4x4 AT.",,,,,,

So ingenious and unusual solutions must be found to make that happen. This family home in Japan took on an even greater challenge and turned out to be an architectural gem.

One of the things that Japan is notorious for is the limited space for urban development. With a huge percentage of its landmass represented by mountains and forests this country’s metropolitan centers became very crammed. Some have described it as “a nation obsessed with making things as small as possible” so its micro dwellings (from apartments and homes to hotels) became famous around the world.Today there’s a frenzy to build off-grid yet comfy tiny homes in remote natural areas as far away from civilization as possible. But it seems to be even more challenging to build a similar home in a very busy urban center surrounded by larger buildings with very little space available. This is what this awesome tiny house accomplished.The plot of land that was available was not only small but had a difficult triangular shape yet this house turned out to be a beautiful home that’s perfectly comfortable for a small family with a bright and spacious interior a versatile loft a charming terrace and even an integrated parking spot.Architect Kota Mizuishi from the Mizuishi Architect Atelier designed this unusual house in Horinouchi in west Tokyo a decade ago. From the outside especially from a bird's eye view the dwelling looks incredibly narrow and it’s almost hard to believe that a couple and their daughter could live comfortably inside. But the asymmetric design and sharp lines reveal a surprisingly spacious layout with all the amenities of a modern home. The Horinouchi tiny house is also called The River Side House because it overlooks a river and Mizuishi imagined this space in relation to that river. Built on a triangular plot of land the two-story house only covers 55 square meters (594 square feet).Unlike typical tiny homes this one has the master bedroom on the ground floor while the kitchen and the living area are upstairs. The bedroom is luminous and minimalistic and the bathroom is big enough to include a bathtub.A staircase leads to the upper floor where the kitchen the living area and a spare room are integrated into an open space design. The kitchen is well equipped and it includes a large fridge and plenty of storage space. There’s also a large dining table for the entire family. The living room is different than the standard Western concept as it doesn’t feature a cozy couch or a lounging area. Furniture was kept to a minimum with no tall pieces that would make the space seem crammed. On the contrary the large windows make it appear even larger than it really is.The large glass areas were specifically chosen to offer beautiful views a lot of natural sunlight and warmth. There’s also discrete air conditioning throughout. Although equipped with modern amenities the house exudes a traditional Japanese minimalistic style with natural colors and materials.Due to this remarkable open space layout  where doors were apparently not welcome you can get a great view of the loft from both the kitchen and the living space. That’s very convenient because the small loft was designed as a playroom for the family’s little girl so the parents could easily keep an eye on her. But the loft with high-vaulted ceilings is also versatile enough to be used as an office room.Unlike American homes Japanese houses don’t typically have space for patios or garages. But the Horinouchi tiny house cleverly included both a terrace and a small parking spot. Large sliding glass doors in the living area provide access to a narrow terrace with metallic railings for uninterrupted views.The home’s unusual geometry was also used to create a small sheltered parking spot outside at the tip of the triangle-shaped plot of land. Yes it’s only big enough for one vehicle but it’s impressive considering the limited surface that was available and the home’s positioning.A surprising tiny construction in the “urban jungle” with a head-turning design the Horinouchi tiny house is inspirational to this day. It proves that modern design and traditional style can be used to turn even an oddly-shaped space into a comfortable home.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxvdmVwcm9wZXJ0eS5jb20vZ2FsbGVyeWxpc3QvNzk2OTQvZ2xhc3MtZG9vcnMtYW5kLXdpbmRvdy1zdHlsZXMtZ2xhemluZy1vcHRpb25zLXRvLWJyaW5nLWluLXRoZS1saWdodNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Glass doors and window styles: glazing options to bring in the light,"Choose glazing that adds an extra design element to your space while bringing in the light with a circular rooflight.

Medics at Royal Bolton have already been working to reduce the number of people waiting for treatment but with demand having outstripped capacity even before the pandemic trust managers more needs to be done.

Chief operating officer Rae Wheatcroft said: “We are always looking for ways to further improve the services we provide for our patients and the speed in which people can access them.

“Thanks to the incredible hard work of our staff all people who have been waiting two years or more for their surgery have now been treated and increasing the capacity of our theatres will help to further drive down our waiting lists.”

How the new complex could look from a bird's eye view

The proposed new modular theatre will connect the hospital’s existing urology block to the operating theatres already in place and will be built on part of the Nicholson car park.

The building will include operating theatres recovery space staff changing facilities storage facilities and a plant room.

An artist's impression of the new complex

As well as providing extra spaces this will allow the hospital to refurbish its existing theatres so that they are capable of hosting medical operations for 52 days a week rather than just 48 as they do currently.

Recent progress made on tackling the backlog of cases has seen the number of people waiting two years for treatment fall from 174 in March this year to none while just 150 patients are now waiting 18 months for an operation compared to 850 last October.

The plans have been put before Bolton Council

But there were still 1069 people waiting more than 52 weeks for surgery as of a Bolton NHS Foundation Trust statement issued in July demonstrating the need for an expansion.

The council will decide on the plans later this year."

In a recession investors tend to flock to dividend stocks as capital gains growth is difficult to achieve and the payout provides an offsetting income stream. Particularly in an inflationary environment dividends can help mitigate the pressure stocks come under.

We're in such a situation right now with the consumer price index at 9.1% and the Federal Reserve's own preferred inflation measure the personal consumption expenditures index jumping to a 40-year high of 6.8% in June.

It marks an acceleration in inflation and means dividend stocks will become even more important to investors. It also suggests betting on the energy sector could be your smartest play because the industry's era of high prices and extraordinary profits are far from over. You can count on the following three all-star energy stocks for a lifetime of passive income.

Chevron

Chevron (CVX 1.79%) is an oil and gas giant and this massive energy company just saw its profits quadruple in size compared to a year ago far surpassing anything Wall Street had predicted.

Chevron certainly benefited from factors at play in the second quarter which saw its downstream refining operations enjoy higher margins despite some offsetting losses in its chemicals business while much higher average sales prices for oil and gas led its domestic and international upstream production assets to generate record profits.

Chevron is looking to ramp up its production as demand shows no sign of easing. It's why oil and gas stocks remain a rich opportunity despite alternative energy sources growing in their share of global usage. There's simply not enough capacity for solar wind and biofuels to meet the demand so fossil fuels will be with us for decades to come.

With a 35-year record of raising its dividend which yields 3.5% annually Chevron should provide a strong safe stream of passive income for investors.

Enterprise Products Partners

Enterprise Products Partners (EPD 0.84%) is one of the largest publicly traded partnerships in the country and its business covers the midstream segment -- pipelines and storage -- of the energy supply chain. It owns over 50000 miles of pipeline 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage and 260 million barrels of storage capacity for natural gas liquids (NGLs) crude oil refined products and petrochemicals while also boasting 21 NGL processing plants.

As a master limited partnership (MLP) Enterprise Products Partners was designed -- and is required -- to pass along almost all of its profits to its shareholders in the form of dividends which currently yield 7.1% a year. Its payout is also considered very safe as its distribution-coverage ratio or the amount of cash flow available for distribution versus what it actually disburses to its shareholders stood at 1.8 at the end of the last quarter.

Although the ratio should typically not go below 1 as that would imply the dividend is unsustainable these days investors don't want their MLPs cutting it that close. They're looking for a cushion and demand growth capital spending come in large part from their operation cash flows.

Enterprise Products just-reported second quarter results show that where it expects growth capex to be $1.6 billion for the year it generated $2.1 billion in operating cash flows for the quarter. And that's by design as it began transitioning to internally fund its growth capex without tapping the equity or debt markets as far back as 2017. The MLP also increased its distribution this quarter 5.6% giving investors the best of both worlds.

ExxonMobil

It wasn't just Chevron hitting the gas on second-quarter earnings -- ExxonMobil (XOM 1.97%) was also blowing up the stock charts when its profits trounced analyst expectations. While it fell short on revenue estimates Exxon crushed it on earnings reporting $4.14 per share in profits when Wall Street thought it would notch just $3.74 per share.

Like its peer Exxon benefited from higher pricing and reduced supplies which led its production and refining operations to end up with natural gas realizations and refining margins well above its 10-year range. Coupled with a cost-cutting program that is (figuratively) paying dividends for investors it helps explain why Exxon stock is up 58% year-to-date with plenty more room to run.

Exxon of course is the largest of the energy giants with a $411 billion valuation (in contrast Chevron is No. 2 at $324 billion). And because it has taken pains to rein in its far-flung production operations to just those that are most profitable it possesses some of the choicest opportunities globally -- such as those in Guyana where it is focusing on making that country a top-10 producer.

Exxon has raised its dividend for 39 consecutive years making it a member of the Dividend Aristocrats and there's no reason it won't continue providing a stream of passive income for at least another 39 years or more.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8va2VueWFud2FsbHN0cmVldC5jb20vNS1iZWFyLW1hcmtldC1kaXZpZGVuZC1zdG9ja3MtdG8ta25vdy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Bear Market Dividend Stocks That Should Be On Your Watchlist Now,"This is a guest contribution by Tim Thomas timthomas.co for SureDividend

In the months since the all-time highs reached by the US stock indices the markets have reminded investors that at some point what goes up will come down.

For dividend investors a good benchmark to follow is the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats which index of large companies that have raised their dividends every year for the past 25 years. During a market downturn dividend-paying stocks often prosper and during 2008 when Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 37% Dividend Aristocrats gave back a more palatable 22%.

In the same way a housing market crash can be financially painful stock price declines can be difficult to swallow especially for volatile Nasdaq listed stocks. However history has consistently shown that investing in quality stocks during corrections and bear markets pays off. While market declines pale compared to rallies that follow investors need to keep a level head manage their risk and do their research.

So a key question is: Which stocks should you buy on a dip?

High yields stocks provide a passive income but investors should be aware of inflation; Dividend investors who once considered stocks as high yield when inflation was low would have to revise their expectations with higher inflation.

Walmart (WMT)

Why do stocks such as Costco Wholesale Walmart and Procter & Gamble maintain their all-time highs as the broader indices decline? Their balance sheets are solid and they are all industry leaders. The three firms have unique pricing power that places them in a strong position to combat inflation.

Walmart has a simple investment thesis. Consumers will cut back on spending when prices rise and while gas prices may be beyond their control they can limit discretionary spending. Cost-conscious consumers are more likely to choose Walmart over Williams-Sonoma or other high-end retailers. A quick look at Walmart’s price chart compared to Williams-Sonoma is strong evidence of consumer preference.

Walmart’s stock remains relatively cheap despite outperforming the S&P 500 over the past five years by 137%. Walmart has a forward P/E ratio of 23.3. Moreover Walmart has been paying and increasing its dividend for 47 consecutive years making it a Dividend Aristocrat. In addition to reinvesting in its core business the company routinely raises its dividend and purchases its stock with extra cash flow.

As a result Walmart is now an excellent safe stock to consider due to its unique blend of upside value and income.

ExxonMobil (XOM)

Due to recent trends it may seem almost inexplicable that oil prices briefly fell into negative territory about two years ago. Pandemic conditions previously created a surplus of oil to the point that existing storage capacity exceeded oil production. But since the opening of the economy and resurging demand the trend has reversed dramatically.

The overall inflationary trend now causes a different economic worry and rising oil prices are one cause of this trend. In one way or the other almost industries are affected by the oil price making it the single most significant contributor to current inflationary trends.

Many companies are facing pressure from rising costs. Still ExxonMobil is benefiting from soaring oil prices. Due to high inflation levels it may remain one of the most successful performers if the stock market moves into bear-market territory.

In its industry Exxon is an industry titan and its large-scale and diverse business model has historically permitted it to thrive even when conditions are less favorable than they are today.

Economic conditions are likely to continue shaping in a manner consistent with high inflation so that Exxon could perform better than the market. The company’s demand outlook remains favorable even if high inflation pushes the economy into recession and businesses and consumers cut back on oil and energy usage.

Although alternative energy technologies have made some progress trends such as the emergence of the global middle class population growth and the expanding worldwide economy have made oil more essential than ever before.

Despite recent valuation gains Exxon Mobile continues to yield a substantial 4% dividend. ExxonMobil stock appears poised to beat inflation as profits climb and performance trends improve.

Abbott Laboratories (ABT)

Diagnostics medical devices and nutritional formulas company Abbott Labs (ABT) is profiting from the steady increase in health care needs. AbbVie (ABBV) the brand-name drugs business was spun off in 2013.

Abbott announced last year that it would sell its generics business in developed countries but keep it in developing ones. The move will allow Abbott to target faster-growing regions. According to investment bank Barclays an aging population and broader healthcare coverage will drive medical device sales by 2025.

Abbott has the most global exposure of the companies on this list with 69% of its sales coming from international markets in Q3. Even with a strong dollar company executives think the Chinese in-vitro diagnostics market will grow by more than 15% annually through 2022.

Consolidated Edison (ED)

For Consolidated Edison (ED) there will be no overseas exposure. In New York City and the surrounding area millions of customers receive their electric and gas service through the holding company. Con Ed earns steady profits because its business is highly regulated. The firm kept raising its dividend during the financial crisis and the company has increased its dividend for 41 years in a row.

Analysts are predicting Con Ed’s stock will grow by 1.3% in 2022 despite rising interest rates. If analysts are correct the utility’s solar energy investments will spur modest growth. Stocks with higher yields provide extra protection from bears if the decline is severe.

Clorox (CLX)

Stocks of consumer goods makers do better during a market downturn. Clorox (CLX) manufactures household cleaning products and is the best example. Its brands include bleach and Glad trash bags. Thus Clorox enjoyed annual sales growth of 4.5% from 2008 to 2010. Dividends have also been on the rise since 1977.

Recently competition has increased pressure on segments such as bleach disinfecting wipes and cat litter. The company is however launching its products. Analysts expect more growth for the fiscal year that ends this June after sales edged down by 0.3% last year. 20% of the company’s sales come from abroad.

Even though we are not (yet) in a bear market it is imperative to remain on high alert and seek out investments that will flourish regardless of the market’s overall direction.

Out with the old and in with the new could be a mantra for fintech superstars Upstart Holdings (UPST 13.24%) and SoFi Technologies (SOFI 0.14%). Upstart is upending the way lenders assess individual credit risk while SoFi is rapidly changing how consumers bank.

Both of these companies are poised for years of rapid growth but one of the stocks is a much-better buy right now.

The case for Upstart Holdings

Upstart is changing how banks and credit unions evaluate credit risk with its artificial intelligence-powered algorithms that draw from a deep well of personal information. The exact depth is a closely guarded secret but the company makes a convincing case that its method creates a more comprehensive picture of an individual's ability to repay a loan than Fair Isaac's three-digit FICO score.

Lenders have been flocking to Upstart because it allows them to reach heaps of potential borrowers who normally slip through the cracks. During the first three months of 2022 Upstart helped its partners originate over 465000 loans a whopping 174% more than the previous year's period.

The company is rapidly expanding from personal loans to auto loan origination a market estimated at $751 billion annually. There are no guarantees that Upstart will continue earning a large share of the enormous auto loan market but it's heading in that direction. Shares of Upstart have tumbled more than 90% from their peak last year and its market cap is down to just $2.5 billion. That is a very nice price to pay for a company that could keep growing by leaps and bounds.

The case for SoFi Technologies

Many consumer banks and credit unions hire Upstart to help originate new loans but not SoFi. This challenger bank has its own AI-fueled algorithms for assessing credit risk and that isn't the only vertical integration that makes its stock a great buy. SoFi recently obtained a national bank charter which means it can fund new loans with savings and checking account deposits from its rapidly expanding customer base. In the second quarter the company added 450000 new members bringing the total up to 4.3 million.

The company's ability to attract deposits is hard to overstate. SoFi got started by refinancing student loans and at the end of June 2020 there were still slightly more lending products on its books than financial services products. Just two years later there were 4.5 financial service products such as checking accounts and retirement accounts for every lending product.

SoFi also owns Galileo one of the fintech industry's most valuable technology platforms. If your business wants to offer customers some form of digital banking or a payment card you'll probably end up using Galileo's application programming interface to make it happen. There were 117 million Galileo accounts on SoFi's books at the end of June.

Relatively tough times ahead

Higher interest rates are limiting consumer demand for new loans. At the same time fears of a recession are limiting lenders' appetites for risk. This is bad news for both companies.

In July Upstart stock got hammered after the company announced preliminary results from the second quarter. Investors were rattled by a total top-line figure for the period that was dramatically lower than expected. The company now says revenue will miss its previous estimate of $295 million to $305 million and land instead at $228 million.

The better buy

While Upstart's results fell short of projections SoFi recently issued a preview of second-quarter results that exceeded the company's own expectations on the top and bottom lines. SoFi shareholders have the company's diverse collection of revenue streams to thank for strong results during a challenging period.

With uniquely integrated operations SoFi can probably deliver more surprises to the upside. That makes it the better stock to buy right now.",,,,,,,,,

Remo

It was another exceptional opportunity to break new grounds in the Philippine real estate industry.

Federal Land Inc. has formed a joint venture with Japanese giant Nomura Real Estate Development Co. Ltd. as it sought to push the envelope once more to develop new urban lifestyles and create master planned smart cities that can offer new possibilities through value creation and sustainable growth.

This formidable trailblazing alliance which was announced in January this year led to the creation of Federal Land NRE Global Inc.—envisioned to usher in a new era in the local property scene with its world-class milestone developments set to rise across Metro Manila Cavite and Cebu.

But these planned undertakings are going to be more than just a nod to Japanese aesthetics and Filipino sensibility. Federal Land NRE Global’s proposed pipeline of residences retail and office space projects will prove to be a remarkable fusion of Japanese architectural expertise advanced technologies and innovation as well as Filipino ingenuity and hospitality—an integration that is set to create new and real value in the Philippine setting.

Seizing opportunities

It was the natural next step for both companies to cement their partnership through a joint venture that will allow them to better seize opportunities in a resilient industry.

To recall Federal Land and Nomura Real Estate along with Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings formed a partnership in 2017 called Sunshine Fort North Bonifacio Realty Development Corporation to develop The Seasons Residences and MITSUKOSHI at Grand Central Park in Bonifacio Global City.

Through The Seasons Residences Nomura Real Estate is bringing to the country the much celebrated Japanese innovations and timeless designs that have been proven to elevate standards of comfort convenience and functionality of spaces. This early this mixed-use complex has already earned the prestigious 5-Star Award for the “Best in High-Rise Residential Building in the Philippines” category at The International Property Awards for Residential High-Rise Development in the Philippines.

Imagine how much more can be done with Federal Land NRE Global Inc.

Milestone on its 50th year

As Federal Land chairman Alfred V. Ty had put it this alliance marks a “major milestone in the 50-year history of Federal Land” noting that they are delighted to bring this partnership with Nomura Real Estate to greater heights.

“We intend to provide relevant real estate solutions that increase value over time and leave a positive mark for generations by building sustainable communities with distinct Japanese style and infused with Filipino sensibility” Ty said.

Nomura Real Estate chair Eiji Kutsukake was meanwhile quoted as saying that they have “invested in a joint venture to accelerate business expansion in a rapidly growing market. We will build and aim for development here while promoting combined housing and commercial projects with Federal Land. We are committed to demonstrate the strengths of both companies through strong partnership strategically favorable location product differentiation and the introduction of advanced added value.”

Nomura Real Estate—the largest developer in Japan in terms of condominium unit turnover as of 2021 and the fifth largest in consolidated sales— is investing around P16 billion in Federal Land NRE Global. This is equivalent to 34 percent of the P48 billion total capital investment made in the joint venture company.

“We believe that this partnership will further deepen the relationship of mutual trust that has been fostered through the collaboration in the Sunshine Fort Project and pursue synergy effects based on the strengths of both parties” added Daisaku Matsuo Nomura Real Estate Development president and representative director.

These are exciting times indeed for Federal Land NRE Global. With Nomura’s prowess and Federal Land’s expertise in creating landmark projects one can only anticipate better more progressive urban development to come.

That list now officially includes Rickie Fowler. The PGA Tour announced Monday morning that Tommy Fleetwood (personal) Lanto Griffin (injury) and Daniel Berger (injury) – although eligible – will not participate in the tournament.

Fowler who missed the cut at last week's Wyndham Championship sneaked into the field. A former top-five player in the world Fowler sits at No. 125 in the FedExCup standings. The top 125 are eligible for the playoffs.

The victory by rookie Joohyung “Tom” Kim at the Wyndham Championship Matt Wallace out of the playoffs. Wallace entered at No. 124 in the standings slipped to No. 125 in the projections by Sunday and then fell to the wrong side of the postseason bubble when Kim won and leapfrogged into the playoffs.

Kim gained temporary PGA Tour membership recently and played the Wyndham on a sponsor exemption. He had to win to qualify for the playoffs.

FEDEX ST. JUDE CHAMPIONSHIP:Scottie Scheffler Rory McIlroy highlight group of qualifiers

GIANNOTTO:It's sad Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson won't be playing in Memphis anymore

Each of the world's current top 10 golfers – Scottie Scheffler Cameron Smith Rory McIlroy Patrick Cantlay Xander Schauffele Jon Rahm Justin Thomas Colin Morikawa Viktor Hovland and Matt Fitzpatrick – and all four reigning major champs (Scheffler Thomas Fitzpatrick and Smith) will tee it up in Memphis this week.

The four-day tournament is scheduled to begin Thursday at TPC Southwind. It is the first time in the 65-year history of the event that it is part of the FedExCup Playoffs. As a result the field is much more robust than in years past. A World Golf Championships event in recent years made it a much more exclusive weekend limiting the field to 75 golfers.

A number of the sport's more prominent names and recognizable faces will not be in Memphis. The likes of Phil Mickelson Dustin Johnson Brooks Koepka Bryson DeChambeau Ian Poulter Bubba Watson Kevin Na and Abraham Ancer (who won last year's tournament at TPC Southwind) are currently suspended from participating in PGA Tour events after joining the Saudi Arabia-backed LIV Golf series earlier this year.

Eleven LIV golfers – Mickelson DeChambeau Talor Gooch Hudson Swafford Matt Jones Ancer Carlos Ortiz Ian Poulter Pat Perez Jason Kokrak and Peter Uihlein – filed a lawsuit last week in the U.S. District Court Northern District of California claiming the tour has violated antitrust law.

Gooch Jones and Swafford are also seeking a temporary restraining order that would allow them to participate in the FedExCup Playoffs including this week's tournament in Memphis.

Most events fall under the auspices of being a regular tour stop with 500 FedEx Cup points available for the winner. You’ll need to make the cut at any event to earn points and while the cut line at these events is the best 65 players ties are also included. That’s why the points chart below goes all the way down to 85: If you make the cut you’re going to get something besides a few dollars in the Direct Deposit: You’re also guaranteed FedEx Cup points.

The winner number increases to 550 for the five “invitational” events where your priority ranking as a TOUR member determines whether you’ll be able to participate. Those points are also increased down the board as well but how the field is determined for these events might not be strictly the TOUR’s priority ranking system. Other paths such as being a past champion at some events being a well-placed amateur or other factors can go into who gets a spot.

Most of these events also limit the field: You’ll see as many as 156 players start a “regular” tour stop but that number is usually less for the invitational events which are:

Sentry Tournament of Champions

Genesis Invitational

Arnold Palmer Invitational

The Memorial

WGC Match Play Championships

The four majors as well as The Players Championship (the “major” that’s put on by the PGA TOUR annually near their headquarters in Ponte Vedra Beach Florida) will earn a victor 600 points and are the five most valuable events each year.

The Masters

The PLAYERS Championship

PGA Championship

U.S. Open

The Open Championship

Finally there are the “cross-field” events or “limited-field” events which normally take place while another big golf tournament his happening somewhere in the world. Since the strength of these fields is often less as the best players are competing at a major or somewhere else the points on offer are less as well. But many offer the same reward all PGA TOUR winners receive which is a full exemption for the rest of that season as well as the next two seasons after the victory. These are classified as “additional events” by the TOUR.

Keep in mind these points are combined and shared based on ties as well. So if two players finish a regular tournament tied for second they would split the points for both second and third place. So each player would receive 245 points (300 for second 190 for third). This happens all the way down the chart as well.

Soon after Big Bang Theory star Kaley Cuoco went viral on Instagram of her wearing a see-through lace dress her keen eye for style is making her trend once again.

On June 20 fans happened to notice an old picture of The Flight Attendant actress floating around on Instagram. Taken on the red carpet at the 2016 InStyle and Warner Bros. Golden Globes after-party Kaley was at the center of another bombshell fashion moment.

Wearing a red spaghetti strap dress with a plunging neckline and thigh-high slit the 8 Simple Rules alum let the gown shine on its own with strappy black heels and minimal jewelry. As for her hair and makeup Kaley tied the look together with bouncy curls and a simple smoky eye.

As more red carpet photos from the event started making the rounds on Instagram Kaley's followers were immediately stunned by how beautiful she looked. They quickly took note and gave their opinions about her award show style despite the picture being taken close to seven years ago.

There's no doubt Kaley's going to turn heads in her next red carpet outfit as she will hopefully be attending the 2022 Primetime Emmy Awards on September 12. After all she is nominated for two awards including Best Actress in a Comedy for portraying Cassie Bowden in The Flight Attendant.

The increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere caused by burning oil gas and coal Mr. Moynihan wrote would dangerously heat the planet melt the glaciers and cause the seas to rise. “Goodbye New York” Mr. Moynihan wrote. “Goodbye Washington for that matter.”

Fifty-three years later Congress is on the cusp of finally responding to what Mr. Moynihan termed “the carbon dioxide problem.”

On Sunday Senate Democrats muscled through a $370 billion bill designed to move the country away from fossil fuels and toward solar wind and other renewable energy. If the House passes the legislation later this week as expected it will be the nation’s first major climate law coming as scientists warn that nations have only a few remaining years to make deep enough cuts in carbon dioxide to avoid planetary catastrophe.

Once enacted the new law is projected to help cut the nation’s greenhouse pollution by roughly 40 percent below 2005 levels by the end of this decade. That’s not enough to avert the worst impacts of a warming planet but it would be a sizable down payment and the largest climate action ever taken by the United States.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vcGx1Z2JvYXRzLmNvbS9zaWxlbnQtNjAtc2VhLXRyaWFsLXF1aWV0LXNwYWNpb3VzLXNlbGYtY2hhcmdpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Silent 60 sea trial: quiet spacious self-charging,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vcGx1Z2JvYXRzLmNvbS9zaWxlbnQtNjAtc2VhLXRyaWFsLXF1aWV0LXNwYWNpb3VzLXNlbGYtY2hhcmdpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D81E65FF0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vcGx1Z2JvYXRzLmNvbS9zaWxlbnQtNjAtc2VhLXRyaWFsLXF1aWV0LXNwYWNpb3VzLXNlbGYtY2hhcmdpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBsYW5ldGFyeS5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZXMvd2F0ZXItb24tdGhlLW1vb24tZ3VpZGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Your Guide to Water on the Moon,"When was water on the Moon discovered?

Scientists have long suspected water might exist on the Moon but exactly how much there was and where it was located has been the source of much debate. In a 1967 paper lunar scientist Harold Urey mocked his colleagues for believing the Moon’s river-like channels were caused by anything other than water such as “lava dust-gas or possibly even vodka.”

The definitive discovery of Moon water came in 2008 when India’s space agency ISRO launched the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft to lunar orbit. Chandrayaan-1 carried with it a NASA-provided science instrument called the Moon Mineralogical Mapper—M3 for short—that observed how the surface absorbed infrared light. Using this data M3 determined that previously suspected water molecules were ice inside the Moon’s polar craters.

A year later in 2009 NASA launched the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and an impact probe called LCROSS. The upper stage from the rocket used to launch LRO and LCROSS was deliberately smashed into a dark crater on the Moon’s south pole. LCROSS flew through the debris plume and detected 155 kilograms of water before it too crashed into the Moon.

Since then many other Moon missions have seen hints of water in different forms and in different regions. Though these discoveries are vital incremental steps in the scientific process they are occasionally over-hyped by the media.

In 2020 NASA and the German space agency’s flying SOFIA telescope observed the Moon in infrared and confirmed water's presence in non-polar regions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vY29sbGlkZXIuY29tL3NvbGFyLW9wcG9zaXRlcy1zZWFzb24tNC10aG9tYXMtbWlkZGxlZGl0Y2gtc2Vhbi1naWFtYnJvbmVtYXJ5LW1hY2staW50ZXJ2aWV3LXNkY2Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Solar Opposites': Thomas Middleditch Sean Giambrone and Mary Mack Talk Favorite Storylines & Season 4,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='collider.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /solar-opposites-season-4-thomas-middleditch-sean-giambronemary-mack-interview-sdcc/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D81E66A70>, 'Connection to collider.com timed out.

The grant will be presented at DAV’s national convention at the Hyatt Regency Orlando in Orlando Florida on Aug. 6.

Ford’s gift will fund the purchase of eight new Ford Transit Connect vehicles for the organization’s nationwide Transportation Network which provides no-cost rides for veterans to and from Department of Veterans Affairs medical appointments. In 2021 alone Ford also donated $45000 to the DAV Scholarship Program which incentivizes young people who volunteer to help veterans and their families.

Ford Motor Co.’s support of America’s veterans dates back to 1922 when Henry Ford organized a cross-country caravan of 50 Model Ts to take disabled veterans to the 1922 DAV National Convention in San Francisco.

“We are extremely proud and appreciative for our long partnership with Ford Motor Co.” said DAV National Commander Andy Marshall. “Volunteers nationwide will use these Ford vehicles to guarantee our injured and ill veterans get to and from their medical appointments. Without this program many of these veterans would simply not be able to access the care they need and have earned.”

Since 1996 Ford has donated 256 vehicles to DAV’s fleet. That’s in addition to the 3618 Ford vehicles purchased by DAV its chapters and departments and the DAV National Service Foundation’s Columbia Trust since 1987. In total more than $90 million has been dedicated to supporting this critical program.

“Ford has truly made supporting and empowering veterans a part of their mission and legacy” said Marshall. “Ford is an iconic American brand and we’re thankful they continue to support the men and women who preserve the American way of life.”

""This family borrows heavily from the original Mirai source code but what separates it from other IoT malware families is its built-in capability to brute force credentials and gain access to SSH servers instead of Telnet as implemented in Mirai"" Fortinet FortiGuard Labs said in a report.

The malware which gets its name from an embedded URL to a YouTube rap music video in an earlier version is said to have amassed a growing collection of compromised SSH servers with over 3500 unique IP addresses used to scan and brute-force their way into the servers.

RapperBot's current implementation also delineates it from Mirai allowing it to primarily function as an SSH brute-force tool with limited capabilities to carry out distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

The deviation from traditional Mirai behavior is further evidenced in its attempt to establish persistence on the compromised host effectively permitting the threat actor to maintain long-term access long after the malware has been removed or the device has been rebooted.

The attacks entail brute-forcing potential targets using a list of credentials received from a remote server. Upon successfully breaking into a vulnerable SSH server the valid credentials are exfiltrated back to the command-and-control.

""Since mid-July RapperBot has switched from self-propagation to maintaining remote access into the brute-forced SSH servers"" the researchers said.

The access is achieved by adding the operators' SSH public key to a special file called ""~/.ssh/authorized_keys"" permitting the adversary to connect and authenticate to the server using the corresponding private private key without having to furnish a password.

""This presents a threat to compromised SSH servers as threat actors can access them even after SSH credentials have been changed or SSH password authentication is disabled"" the researchers explained.

""Moreover since the file is replaced all existing authorized keys are deleted which prevents legitimate users from accessing the SSH server via public key authentication.""

The shift also enables the malware to maintain its access to these hacked devices via SSH permitting the actor to leverage the foothold to conduct Mirai-styled denial-of-service attacks.

These differences from other IoT malware families have had the side-effect of making its primary motivations something of a mystery a fact further complicated by the fact that RapperBot's authors have left little-to-no telltale signs of their provenance.

The ditching of self-propagation in favor of persistence notwithstanding the botnet is said to have undergone significant changes in a short span of time chief among them being the removal of DDoS attack features from the artifacts at one point only to be reintroduced a week later.

The objectives of the campaign ultimately remain nebulous at best with no follow-on activity observed post a successful compromise. What's clear is that SSH servers with default or guessable credentials are being corralled into a botnet for some unspecified future purpose.

To fend off such infections it's recommended that users set strong passwords for devices or disable password authentication for SSH where possible.

""Although this threat heavily borrows code from Mirai it has features that set it apart from its predecessor and its variants"" the researchers said. ""Its ability to persist in the victim system gives threat actors the flexibility to use them for any malicious purpose they desire.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Given this new law we will be forced to plan for more employment growth outside our home state"" the company said in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital on Sunday.

Republican Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb signed into law Senate Bill 1 on Friday which bans abortions at any stage with exceptions for when the mother's life is at risk and in cases of rape incest or fatal fetal anomalies.

""Following the overturning of Roe I stated clearly that I would be willing to support legislation that made progress in protecting life"" Holcomb said the Indy Star reported. ""In my view SEA 1 accomplishes this goal following its passage in both chambers of the Indiana General Assembly with a solid majority of support.""

CALIFORNIA PROPOSES $1.65B FILM TAX CREDIT TO DRAW PRODUCTIONS FROM ANTI-ABORTION STATES

Republicans such as Indiana state Rep. Wendy McNamara celebrated the new law saying it makes Indiana ""one of the most pro-life states in the nation."" The law will take effect on Sept. 15.

The move set off condemnation from Eli Lilly fellow Indiana-based corporation Cummins as well as the White House.

Wade and eliminate women's constitutionally protected right to abortion"" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement Saturday. ""And it's another radical step by Republican legislators to take away women's reproductive rights and freedom and put personal health care decisions in the hands of politicians rather than women and their doctors.""

Eli Lilly continued in its statement that it is worried the law will hinder both the company and Indiana from attracting ""diverse scientific engineering and business talent from around the world.""

A TikTok user called out feminine care giant Tampax after finding a strange object inside a tampon.

""My brain instantly said tracker"" one commenter said on the issue.

""We want to reassure you this was an isolated issue"" P&G told Fox News in a statement.

A woman claimed to find a small mystery object in her Tampax brand tampon in a now viral video on TikTok.

In the video which has now been viewed over 8 million times since it was posted on July 12 TikTok user Celia Piemontes said she purchased Tampax tampons instead of her usual organic brand due to a shortage. Upon opening the box she quickly grew concerned with the contents inside.

The tampons in her video each had a purple applicator except for one that was bright red and marked with the letters ""SS"" on the applicator. The tampon inside held a tiny shiny object that appeared to be metal.

""So I just opened it up"" Piemontese says in the video. ""What is that? What the f***?""

The video currently has nearly 10000 comments and over 1 million likes. Some commenter wrote that it was likely a quality control test that went undetected while others were more suspicious of the mysterious object.

The Honey Pot & Co an organic feminine care brand also weighed in on the situation in the comment section.

""Bestie this is your sign to stick to organic"" the company commented.

In a follow-up video Piemontese gives a closer look at the tiny ""clearly metal"" object and the tampon she in which she found it.

In another video Piemontese says that Tampax reached out to her via direct message and offered to compensate her for the mistake. In yet another post she later admitted she received the tampons from a friend who worked for Tampax not from a store.

Given this new law we will be forced to plan for more employment growth outside our home state"" the company said in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital on Sunday.

Republican Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb signed into law Senate Bill 1 on Friday which bans abortions at any stage with exceptions for when the mother's life is at risk and in cases of rape incest or fatal fetal anomalies.

""Following the overturning of Roe I stated clearly that I would be willing to support legislation that made progress in protecting life"" Holcomb said the Indy Star reported. ""In my view SEA 1 accomplishes this goal following its passage in both chambers of the Indiana General Assembly with a solid majority of support.""

Aug 7th 2022

Port Adelaide great Kane Cornes has ripped Lance Franklin after the champion forward released a statement on Saturday declaring he'd put contract talks on hold until the end of the season.

The news dropped by Franklin's manager Adam Finch came after the 1000-goal superstar was linked to a move to the Lions as he nears the end of his nine-year $10 million contract with the Swans.

Journalist Damian Barrett said the timing was audacious with the Swans travelling to Melbourne for their game against North Melbourne at Marvel Stadium.

""It's a provocative statement to release through his manager - another new manager - on the day he was travelling with his team to Melbourne to play a game of footy to say he's putting all contract talks on hold"" Barrett told Nine's The Sunday Footy Show.

""If you want to read into it which we (as the media) do - we critique and analyse and dissect - it's a statement that says [he's] not going to be at Sydney next year unless they considerably up the ante which they have been reluctant to do for their own reason to this point.""

With the statement also opening the door to Franklin possibility retiring at season's end Cornes suggested the particulars were self-centred.

""It was a very 'me me me' thing to do I thought from Buddy Franklin when the Sydney Swans are flying"" he said.

""They've paid him $10 million over nine years … I understand that (he's delivered on his contract) but I'm not sure you need to release a statement prior to the game. What was the point of Buddy doing that?

""It didn't alleviate any of the talk … it made the talk fester more.

""The day before a game to release a statement like that I thought it was really strange.""

Last Friday when I woke in my little tent the Garmin Forerunner 955 wished me Happy Birthday. This as it turns out would be a new feature on the Garmin Forerunner 255 and Forerunner 955 which were just launched two months prior. The feature is included as part of the ‘Morning Report’ functionality which normally shows details like training status sleep & HRV status as well as upcoming structured workouts.

This day though it wished me Happy Birthday In fact it technically had a small animation throwing confetti which you can see below:

However unlike when Wahoo added this feature to their Wahoo Rival watch Garmin does not sing you Happy Birthday. Which is probably a good thing in this rare context as then I didn’t have to disclose to the couple of other tents directly next to mine on the side of a mountain at 6AM that it was my birthday. Something that undoubtedly would have surfaced at a refuge food stop later in the day. Phew saved by lack of features!

In any case since I didn’t know this feature existed I figured I’d share. I checked with Garmin and this is indeed new/first seen on the Forerunner 255/955. Undoubtedly as more Garmin watches get the Morning Report Feature (such as the Fenix/Epix series in a future firmware update) it’ll probably include this as a baseline. It’s worthwhile noting that this actually isn’t the only ‘unique’ Morning Report alert that occurs. When you have a scheduled race it shows an entirely different morning report too encouraging you for the day. Further on that day it won’t list any of your training/readiness stats. Garmin says the idea being that whether or not you slept well that night isn’t something that needs to distract you from the race ahead. And while I’m sure someone will invariably complain/say that resources should have been spent elsewhere the reality is that we as humans judge our devices based on our attachment to them. And companies that go the extra mile to do minor things that we remember strengthen that bond and one’s likelihood to buy from them again. We see this across not just the tech industry in numerous ways and the companies that ‘surprise and delight’ almost always do better than the ones that stay the course and go out of business.

In any case after taking some photos of the Birthday message I packed up my tent and carried on ready to tackle an upcoming fugly day of rain and wind in the Alps. Which gets me to why it’s been a bit quiet around here the last 10 days or so – I’ve been off solo camping and hiking the Tour du Mont Blanc a 170km/105mi trek that goes around the Mont Blanc range. It includes some 10000m/30000ft of elevation gain with lots of cell phone dead spots. For the first time in a few decades I separated from a laptop for more than week. And for the first time ever on this site I didn’t post something in over 10 days. I just stepped off into the mountains and enjoyed it.

I’ve been publishing roughly daily story sets to Instagram Stories plus my Strava. Which includes plenty of epic hilariousness especially the items posted in the last 24 hours.

You can see all my Instagram stories by tapping my profile picture. Additionally I’ve placed all of the Instagram Stories into two archives at the top. Each archive is limited to 100 stories thus I’ll probably have to add a third one for the last two days. You can see these here:

Fear not later in the week I’ve got a fully detailed post about it all plus a video. Most of my Instagram Stories are just using my phone photos/videos whereas the bulk of what I shot was actually on a GoPro. But offloading that mid-hike is too much of a battery drain.

With that – enjoy! And expect the sports tech goodness to resume in full force this week!

Two-minute review

The Garmin Venu 2 is still one of the best Garmin watches you can buy today. It straddles the line between smartwatch and running watch remarkably well balancing advanced workout tracking tools with essential everyday apps to create a smartwatch for all occasions. There's not been anything to replace it in Garmin's stable quite yet especially in its price bracket.

Like many modern wearables the Venu 2 puts a heavy emphasis on wellness with all-day stress monitoring and a running Body Battery energy score reminding you to take care of your mental health. You can also log water intake see your daily steps stairs climbed and calories burned and monitor your sleep patterns.

However this is no simple fitness tracker – the Venu 2 is packed with serious tools for monitoring a wide range of sports. Runners are particularly well catered for. As you'd expect from Garmin a company that made its name in accurate satellite navigation the on-board GPS is extremely accurate providing measurements with a tiny margin of error and constructing highly detailed maps that show your changing pace throughout your training session.

Delve into the watch's built-in apps and as with the Venu Sq you'll find advanced tools like Garmin Coach (which works together with training plans downloaded from the Garmin Connect app) leaderboards for any challenges you're participating in and a detailed breakdown of your most recent workouts. Venu Sq users can also download the Challenges app but it's not pre-loaded.

When you're out training Venu 2 users will also benefit from auto-pause split recording and elevation tracking courtesy of the on-board altimeter. It's not quite as advanced as the Fenix 7 or Forerunner 955 which offer more advanced tools for managing training plus live navigation but it's a very strong offering particularly for the price.

Gym-goers are well catered to as well; this is the first Garmin device to feature muscle map graphics that helps you plan workouts based on training load for each major muscle group. The small touches make a difference too. Unlike some sports watches we've tested recently the Venu 2 doesn't mistakenly log steps during a spin class and the always-on screen option means it's easy to monitor which heart rate zone you're currently in during tough training sessions.

Swimmers will benefit from underwater heart rate monitoring stroke type detection and pool metrics and golfers will find the Venu 2 is as capable as many dedicated golf watches.

All of these tools are delivered on a super crisp AMOLED display with a high resolution that allows you to see a huge amount of data at once without the need to consult the Garmin Connect app on your phone. It's a hugely impressive package and its features combine to make a sports watch that's smart and practical enough to wear all day and all night.

$399.99 / £349.99 / AU$629

Frequently found on offer

The Garmin Venu 2 was released in April 2021 priced at $399.99 / £349.99 / AU$629 for both the 40mm and 45mm case sizes. That's slightly higher than the launch price of the original Garmin Venu when it debuted in 2020 and around twice the price of the Garmin Venu Sq (without music). Now you can pick one up on offer for significantly less. Check out the Garmin promo codes currently available to potentially save more.

Garmin Venu 2: Design

Similar to original Venu

Choice of 44mm and 40mm case sizes

Range of band case and bezel colors

Design Score: 5/5

The Garmin Venu 2 looks much like its predecessor with a classic design that's smart enough for daytime wear yet practical enough for workouts. It's not groundbreaking with a silicone band metal bezel and polymer case but the new watch addresses one of our biggest complaints about the original Venu which was its lack of different size options.

The standard Venu 2 has a 44mm case and 33mm display while the smaller Venu 2S (the version we're testing here) has a 40mm case and 27.9mm display. Both sizes accept Garmin's standard 18mm bands so you can exchange the standard strap for something a little different.

The 44mm version is available in two colorways: slate with a black case and granite blue with a matching case. Both have a silver-colored stainless steel bezel. The 40mm Venu 2S comes in four colors: graphite with a slate bezel light sand with a light gold bezel mist gray with a silver bezel and white with a rose gold bezel.

If you're in the US you can put together a 'custom' design when you order your watch picking and mixing straps and cases to create a combination that suits you.

Garmin Venu 2 rear sensors (Image credit: Future)

The watch is controlled via a touchscreen and two physical buttons on the right-hand edge. The lower of these serves as a back button while the upper right is context-sensitive with icons appearing on-screen to show what action it will perform at a particular time in a similar manner to the Garmin Instinct's dual-screen display.

There are several attractive watch faces to choose from including a selection of options that are animated when the watch wakes (though there's also an always-on option if you don't mind the extra battery drain).

Garmin Venu 2: Display

Vivid AMOLED screen

High resolution for extra detail

Adjustable brightness levels

Display score: 5/5

Like the original Garmin Venu one of the Venu 2's most striking feature is its vivid AMOLED touchscreen. This has received a resolution upgrade for 2021 and is now packing 416 x 416 pixels for the 44mm Venu 2 and 360 x 360 pixels for the 40mm Venu 2S.

For comparison the original 43.2mm Garmin Venu has a resolution of 390 x 390 pixels and the display of the flagship Fenix 6 is just 240 x 240 pixels.

That pixel density means graphics and text are crisp and clear and it's possible to see graphs and charts in fine detail right on your wrist without consulting the smartphone app. The sheer amount of data visible at a glance is very; if you want to see a graph of your heart rate or stress levels throughout the day or even the week it's all right there.

The watch is set to its lowest brightness setting by default and we found this was suitable for most situations but you can also turn it up higher for viewing in sunny conditions. Again this will cause battery life to take a hit but the difference wasn't as much as we'd expected only reducing longevity by a few percentage points each day.

Smartwatch features

Detailed calendar view and app notifications

Music playback from multiple sources

Third-party apps are a mixed bag

Features score: 4/5

The Garmin Venu 2 is a well-specced smartwatch and its high-resolution screen means you can view detailed information about the day's schedule the weather app notifications and more right on your wrist.

Like the Venu Sq the Venu 2 also includes optional women's health tracking which you can set as one of the shortcuts in your list of activities. Surprisingly this is more comprehensive than the tool featured in the women-focused Garmin Lily with a wider range of symptoms and moods to choose from to help you better understand your cycle.

Garmin Pay allows you to make contactless purchases via NFC provided your bank is one of those supported. You'll need to set this up in the Garmin Connect app on your phone before you can use it; you won't see the option in the watch's menu by default unless you do this.

The watch is capable of playing music from a third-party app like Amazon Music Deezer or Spotify (apps for which are available via Garmin Connect IQ) or from its own internal storage. Whereas the Venu Sq Music had space for up to 500 songs the Venu 2 and 2S both have space for 650 which should give you plenty of options during long training sessions.

To download songs you'll first need to connect your phone to a Wi-Fi network in Garmin Connect. This is quite a straightforward process; just tap the device shown at the top of the app's homescreen and follow the instructions

You can also use the Venu 2 to control music playback on your phone with options to play/pause the current track skip forward and back and adjust the volume. Unlike many watches the display is able to show the artist and track name plus a progress bar and timer. It's also possible to use the watch to control playback of YouTube videos on your phone which is very handy if you're casting them to a TV.

Garmin Connect IQ apps (Image credit: Garmin)

The Garmin Connect IQ store certainly isn't as feature-packed as Google Play or the App Store and its contents are a thoroughly mixed bag. The best offerings tend to be focused around fitness and navigation (Google Maps Komoot and Stryd are all great tools that really add to your watch's functionality) but the many basic timer apps and dull games aren't too impressive.

A handful of apps are pre-installed on the Venu 2 which has space for 35 in total. Any you don't use regularly can be uninstalled through Connect IQ.

Fitness tracking

Extremely accurate GPS

Detailed workout metrics at a glance

Wide range of activities supported

Tracking score: 5/5

The Garmin Venu 2 can track dozens of indoor and outdoor workouts and during setup you'll be prompted to choose a handful of your favorites – a helpful feature that avoids the need to scroll through a long list each time you want to work out.

GPS accuracy has proved very impressive in our tests matching our pre-measured 5km route to within 10 meters (a margin of error easily accounted for by the width of the roads and footpaths). That's what we've come to expect from a company founded on the strength of its satellite positioning technology and it's good to see that it's unchanged.

Once you've completed a workout you'll be presented with a small map (if it was GPS-tracked) plus distance time steps pace calories and heart rate data. If your watch is connected to an ANT+ enabled sensor like a power meter stats from this will able be available at a glance.

One of Garmin Connect's best features is the ability to set up training plans to help you achieve a particular goal (such as hitting a certain time in your next half marathon) with workout suggestions that adapt depending on your fitness level and past performance. Browse through the Venu 2's optional widgets and you'll find a Garmin Coach shortcut that lets you view these plans on your wrist and start your next planned training session with a quick touch.

For gym workouts the Venu 2 again performs well. We put it to the test in several intense spin classes and the watch quickly detected changes in heart rate resulting in the expected spikes during sprints with no irregular peaks or troughs.

You can scroll through past workouts on the device any time (detailed statistics and maps are stored on the watch) and if you're thinking of upgrading from a different Garmin device you'll be pleased to learn that you can scroll through all recent workouts synced with Garmin Connect – not just those recorded by the Venu 2 itself.

On the subject of workouts it's also worth noting that most smartwatches only have a single physical button or dial while dedicated running watches are often controlled by multiple buttons. This prevents you accidentally cancelling a workout with an errant flick of the screen and makes it possible to use your sports watch while wearing gloves in cold weather. The touchscreen can even be locked.

With two physical buttons the Venu 2 strikes a good balance. You'll need to deliberately press one of the buttons to pause or resume your workout and finer controls can be operated through the touchscreen (which can be locked to prevent accidental taps or swipes).

Garmin Venu 2 workout history (Image credit: Future)

As we've mentioned above the upper button is multi-functional and performs different tasks depending which workout widget you're using. This is never confusing thanks to Garmin's use of contextual icons which let you know exactly what it will do at any point – a feature carried over from the Garmin Instinct which used a small secondary display to perform the same function.

Companion app

Fully customizable homescreen

Deep dives into health data

See graphs of streaks and challenges

Companion app score: 5/5

Like all Garmin devices the Venu 2 links to the Garmin Connect app on your smartphone via Bluetooth. It's a well-designed app that pools together data from all the company's devices including smartwatches smart scales cycling power meters and foot pods and presents it all clearly and consistently.

The app's homescreen is fully customizable with quick-view widgets for details of your last workout heart rate sleep score stress level body battery calories burned menstrual cycle and more. You can add remove and reposition these at will and the app can also offer 'health insights' on the homescreen if it detects a pattern or change in your daily activities. On a streak for achieving your daily steps goal or becoming noticeably more active on a Monday? Connect can let you know.

There are also some impressive social features including the ability to create challenges with friends participate in community challenges (complete with leaderboards which you can view on the Venu 2 once you've signed up) and set up emergency contacts in case you have an accident while you're out training.

If your training buddies don't use Garmin devices all your workout data can be synced with third-party apps like Strava automatically. You can also sync data with an impressive range of other diet and fitness apps including MyFitnessPal Nike+ TrainingPeaks Noom and Zwift to name just a few. In our tests workouts synced with Strava and Nutracheck almost instantly.

Health metrics in Garmin Connect (Image credit: Garmin)

To use the Venu 2's golfing features you'll need to install the separate Garmin Golf app. This is free and it's understandable that it's not part of Connect by default; with details of over 40000 courses it would increase the app's download size significantly.

Garmin Connect has received some major updates in recent months with new features such as pregnancy tracking and we anticipate it will continue to develop over the coming years adding extra functionality to the company's devices.

Buy it if...

You want one watch for all occasions

The Garmin Venu 2 has an understated design that doesn't scream 'sports watch' and offers an impressive range of everyday smartwatch features but also offers a huge set of advanced workout tracking and training tools.

You want workout stats at a glance

The Venu 2's excellent screen means it's possible to drill down through impressively granular detail without using your smartphone. Charts graphs and maps are all well represented right on your wrist.

You enjoy a variety of sports

While Garmin is perhaps best known for its expertise in running and cycling the Venu 2 is also an excellent watch for the gym with accurate metrics for all the most common training types including weights spinning HIIT treadmill running and resistance machines to name just a few.

Don't buy it if...

You don't work out regularly

The Venu 2 is equal parts sports watch and general-purpose smartwatch so if you're not already training or planning to start then you'll be missing out on half its features.

You're on a tight budget

This certainly isn't the most affordable smartwatch around and if money is tight then take a look at our roundup of the best cheap smartwatches for some other options. They won't have the same feature set as the Venu 2 but they might offer a suitable compromise.

You want lots of third-party apps

The Garmin Connect store is a lot more limited than Apple's App Store. If you want a device that you can pack with fun games to keep you occupied you're better off with an Apple Watch.

Also consider

Apple Watch Series 7 If you're an iPhone and Apple TV user it makes sense to use Apple's ability to seamlessly connect its devices with kit like Apple Fitness+.

The Garmin HRM-Pro heart rate monitor was released in 2020 and continues to serve as a very capable chest strap. If you bought one in 2020 you may have changed the battery out one or two times and experienced the inconvenience of the small screws on the battery access door. Battery compartment access is the only noticeable design change in the HRM-Pro Plus with the one software improvement also available on the HRM-Pro.

If you don't already have a chest strap heart rate monitor go with the HRM-Pro Pus.

While we often look for significant improvements in new products there were no real faults in the HRM-Pro except for the terrible battery access design. Creating a new product that improves something and then serves as the default product for that category is perfectly acceptable. If you don't already have a chest strap heart rate monitor go with the HRM-Pro Pus. However if you already have the HRM-Pro then there is no reason to upgrade to the new heart rate monitor until your existing model fails.

Also: The 5 best Garmin watch models: Which is right for you?

In the early days of GPS watches I wore a chest strap since heart rate monitoring from the wrist was not very accurate. After a while chest straps bothered me and I found wrist-based monitoring to be good enough for my needs. With Garmin's heart rate monitors serving as the data source for running dynamics and now with the 2022 Garmin watches as the data source for running power I am back to working out with a chest strap. I am also now an active Hydrow user so a chest strap is needed to get the most accurate workout experience.

The HRM-Pro (top) and HRM-Pro Plus (bottom) have different battery compartment access panels Matthew Miller/ZDNet

With the HRM-Pro there were four screws that needed to be removed to replace the coin cell battery in the monitor and an O-ring that you had to make sure was properly positioned to maintain the 5ATM water resistance. On the HRM-Pro Plus you simply rotate the back battery cover to remove the cover and replace the battery. There is even a small tab positioned under the battery so you can easily pull it up and remove the battery. This is a nice touch as I often have had to use a screwdriver or other pry tool to get coin cell batteries out of things. Don't remove the white battery assist device from the pod. The same silicone cover over the battery compartment is present but it is now white instead of yellow.

The strap itself is made of the same flexible material as the HRM-Pro including the clasp backing piece that keeps the strap connection from running on your skin. There are also two contact areas on the inside of the band. The band length is also adjustable and like the HRM-Pro I have it near the maximum length to fit around my chest. The strap is very comfortable for extended periods of wear and does not shift around when secured properly.

Don't remove the white tab as that helps you remove the battery Matthew Miller/ZDNet

The HRM-Pro Plus provides heart rate data over ANT+ and Bluetooth so it works with your Garmin watch smartphone apps compatible equipment in the gym and other GPS or smartwatches. Swimmers will appreciate the 5ATM water resistance and storage of heart rate data on the band that syncs to your device but the strap may slide down since it is not optimized for swimming in all conditions. If you take your Garmin device off for team sports and other activities the HRM-Pro Plus can be worn to track steps intensity minutes and more that can later be synced to your Garmin device.

Also: Garmin Forerunner 955 Solar review: Garmin's most powerful watch built for runners

The one software improvement in the HRM-Pro Plus is the ability for the heart rate monitor to track indoor run pace and distance so when you are on a treadmill Garmin will help track these metrics. This software improvement is also now available on the 2020 HRM-Pro via a software update so the HRM-Pro will have the same software as the HRM-Pro Plus at no additional cost to the HRM-Pro owner.

With new Garmin watches such as the Forerunner 955 Solar running power support is now native to the watch. This means when you have the Forerunner paired to the watch then running power and running dynamics (stride length run cadence vertical ratio and ground contact time) will appear on the watch and in your running summary report. Running power support is also provided to older Garmin watches that don't have native running power support through ConnectIQ apps.

I only run outside so to fully understand the new indoor running support features of the HRM-Pro Plus and upgraded HRM-Pro I recommend you check out the extensive review on the DC Rainmaker website.

The Garmin HRM-Pro Plus is available now for $129.99 the same price as the HRM-Pro. It offers solid and reliable heart rate monitoring with deep integration in the Garmin ecosystem. The coin cell battery should last you about a year and Garmin actively keeps the strap updated with the latest support and features.

(Gray News) - A former police officer in Fresno County is facing federal charges after authorities said he sexually assaulted four women while on active duty.

According to the Department of Justice a federal grand jury returned a 10-count indictment in charging 38-year-old J. DeShawn Torrence a former Sanger Police Department officer with depriving the women of their constitutional rights under the color of law.

According to the indictment on multiple occasions from August 2017 to June 2021 Torrence engaged in nonconsensual sexual conduct that ranged from directing a victim to remove her clothing without a legitimate law enforcement purpose to forcing his victims to engage in sex acts.

Authorities said four of the charged counts carry a maximum statutory penalty of life in prison and a $250000 fine. One count carries a maximum statutory penalty of 10 years. The remaining five counts each carry a maximum statutory penalty of one year in prison and a fine of up to $100000.

The Justice Department reports the Sanger Police Department no longer employs Torrence and any sentence given would be determined at the court’s discretion.

Officials said the FBI Sacramento Field Office is investigating the case with assistance from the Fresno County Sheriff’s Office.

Authorities urged anyone with further information on this case to contact the FBI at 916-746-7000.

According to Study Finds environmental physiologist Dr. Shawnda Morrison is sounding the alarm in a comprehensive review of studies on this topic.

She said physical fitness is the key to tolerating higher temperatures and unfit children could face heat-related health problems such as dehydration and heat stroke as global warming continues.

According to the doctor obesity and physical inactivity among children are leaving many struggling to regulate their body temperature in the heat leading them to do less exercise.

Morrison said she found that children are 30% less aerobically fit than their parents were at their age with fewer children reaching the World Health Organization’s recommendation of 60 minutes of daily exercise.

The doctor criticized failures to sufficiently prioritize children’s health needs in climate change policy arguing more action is necessary to get children exercising so they will cope in a hotter world.

Morrison shared that the pandemic made children less likely to exercise notably when schools closed and she fears rising heat could similarly obstruct children from physical activity. Parents may also tell their children it’s too hot to play preventing children from maintaining their healthy physical activity requirements.

The study recommends physical education and for children to play sports when it comes to helping them stay fit along with active play among friends and family.

For more than a century Wall Street has been a wealth-building machine for those who are patient. Over long periods high-quality companies and the indexes they're a part of tend to increase in value.

Something else that's commonplace on Wall Street is change. It's perfectly normal for innovation acquisitions competitive advantages and other factors to shake up the world's largest publicly traded companies on a fairly regular basis.

Just 18 years ago companies like General Electric AIG and Intel were among the 10 largest publicly traded companies by market cap. As of Aug. 4 Intel wasn't even in the top 50 any longer while GE and AIG had fallen out of the top 125 and top 250 respectively. Eight years from now in 2030 the stock market's 10 largest stocks could look vastly different than they do today.

While absolutely nothing is set in stone I predict that the following 10 stocks will have the largest market caps by 2030. Note that these 10 companies aren't listed in any particular order.

1. Berkshire Hathaway

The first stock conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.61%) (BRK.B 0.60%) should retain its spot in the top 10 even if billionaire CEO Warren Buffett isn't at the helm come 2030. After overseeing an average annual return on the company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of 20.1% since 1965 Buffett has clearly shown he's set his company up for long-term success.

One factor that makes Berkshire Hathaway such an incredible company is the mountain of passive income it collects every year. Over the next 12 months Buffett's company is expected to bring in well over $6 billion in dividend income with $4.25 billion coming from just a handful of companies. Because dividend stocks have a long history of outperforming nondividend payers holding these time-tested companies for years or decades provides an added boost.

2. Apple

Perhaps the least-surprising prediction is that the largest publicly traded company in the U.S. Apple (AAPL 1.00%) will remain in the top 10 largest stocks by market cap by 2030.

Aside from an easily recognized brand name and faithful customer base Apple's innovation is key to its success. Introducing a 5G-capable iPhone quickly pushed up its market share in the U.S. while CEO Tim Cook is busy leading a multiyear transition that emphasizes subscription services. Ultimately subscriptions should boost Apple's operating margins and lessen the sales volatility witnessed during product replacement cycles.

Apple has also repurchased $520 billion worth of its own common stock since the beginning of 2013. If this aggressive buyback program continues value investors are likely to continue plowing into Apple.

3. Visa

Payment processor Visa (V 0.49%) currently finds itself on the outside looking in (No. 11). By the turn of the decade I expect it to firmly find itself as one of the 10 largest companies by market cap.

Visa's opportunity for expansion is enormous. Most global transactions are still being conducted in cash which means it can expand organically into underbanked regions such as the Middle East Africa and Southeastern Asia or lean on acquisitions to grow (e.g. the Visa Europe buyout in 2016). Sustained double-digit annual growth should be the expectation throughout the decade.

What's more Visa strictly sticks to payment processing. Although the company would probably do just fine as a lender it would also expose Visa to potential loan delinquencies and losses during recessions. By avoiding lending Visa is able to bounce back from economic downturns faster than its peers and maintain a profit margin above 50%.

4. Alphabet

Another FAANG stock that has an exceptionally high likelihood of retaining its top-10 ranking by market cap come 2030 is Alphabet (GOOGL 0.34%) (GOOG 0.24%) the parent company of internet search engine Google and streaming platform YouTube.

Google has long been Alphabet's foundational operating segment. Over the past two years it's handled no less than 91% of global internet search share a big reason why Alphabet sports such incredible ad-pricing power. As traffic acquisition costs decline over time Google should continue to be a cash cow for the company.

But Alphabet's future is about its higher-growth initiatives like YouTube and Google Cloud. YouTube has grown into the second-most-visited social site in the world while Google Cloud has gobbled up 8% of global cloud infrastructure spending.

5. Salesforce

Cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software provider Salesforce (CRM -1.36%) could make one of the biggest leaps (currently No. 43) in terms of market cap by 2030. CRM software is what's used to help businesses enhance customer relationships and boost sales.

Global CRM software sales are expected to sustain double-digit growth through at least mid-decade which is great news for the industry's unquestioned leader. According to IDC Salesforce commanded a 23.8% share of CRM software spending in 2021 (over four times its next-closest competitor).

In addition to its commanding market share co-CEO and co-founder Marc Benioff has a penchant for making earnings-accretive acquisitions. These deals broaden the Salesforce ecosystem and help with the company's cross-selling opportunities.

6. Amazon

E-commerce stock Amazon (AMZN 0.80%) is another really strong bet to retain its spot in among the 10 largest stocks by the turn of the decade.

Most folks know Amazon for its industry-leading online marketplace. In 2022 eMarketer projects that Amazon will account for 39.5% of all U.S. online retail sales. But the real crown jewel is the more than 200 million Prime members who've signed up as a result of its leading marketplace. The fees collected from Prime members help Amazon expand its logistics network and reinvest in high-growth initiatives.

There's also Amazon Web Services (AWS) which is the global No. 1 in cloud infrastructure spending with 33% market share. Corporate cloud spending is still in its early innings which means Amazon's operating cash flow could skyrocket in the years ahead.

7. PayPal Holdings

The company I predict will make the biggest leap into the top 10 stocks by market cap is fintech giant PayPal Holdings (PYPL 1.00%). PayPal is currently No. 88 with a $112 billion market cap.

Digital payments are still in their infancy which bodes well for fee-based payment platforms. Even with U.S. gross domestic product declining in back-to-back quarters PayPal's total payment volume on its network continues to grow by a double-digit percentage on a constant-currency basis.

Arguably even more important active users are more engaged than ever. At the end of 2020 active users were completing 40.9 transactions over the trailing 12 months (ttm). This figure is up to 48.7 transactions per active account on a ttm basis through June 2022 and it continues to climb.

8. Microsoft

Software kingpin Microsoft (MSFT 0.43%) the only company from the 10 largest stocks by market cap in 1999 to still have a top-10 position today has a good shot at sustaining its dominance throughout the decade.

Microsoft's success is a function of raking in mammoth amounts of cash flow from its legacy operations and funneling this cash into faster-growing projects. For instance even though its high-margin Windows franchise is generally a slow grower it still accounts for a 76% share of global desktop operating systems.

Microsoft is utilizing this cash flow to reinvest in a variety of cloud initiatives -- Azure is the global No. 2 in cloud infrastructure spending and grew sales by 46% on a constant-currency basis in the June-ended quarter -- and fuel acquisitions. For instance Microsoft offered $68.7 billion to acquire gaming company Activision Blizzard in January.

9. Chevron

Despite a feverish renewable energy push by most developed countries I predict oil and gas major Chevron (CVX 1.79%) will find its way into 10 largest publicly traded companies by market cap in 2030.

The biggest reason for this push is the expectation that oil and natural gas prices will remain elevated for many years to come. The pandemic resulted in multiple years of reduced domestic and international drilling and pipeline investment. Couple this with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and you'll see there's a clear risk to global energy supply.

Chevron is also in excellent financial shape compared to most other integrated oil stocks. By prudently deploying its capital and minimizing debt Chevron has been able to maintain its superior dividend repurchase its own stock and fund key natural gas projects in the Asia-Pacific region.

10. Meta Platforms

Lastly social media stock Meta Platforms (META 0.60%) the company formerly known as Facebook should find itself as one of the 10 largest stocks in 2030. You'll note that current top-10 stocks Tesla (TSLA -1.57%) UnitedHealth Group (UNH 0.76%) Nvidia (NVDA -1.84%) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 0.60%) didn't make the cut.

Although social media usage statistics can be extremely fickle to project one year in advance let alone in eight years Meta has four of the most downloaded apps in the world. On a combined basis Facebook Instagram WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger attracted 3.65 billion monthly active users in the June-ended quarter. That's over half the global adult population and a big reason why Facebook's ad-pricing power is exceptionally strong more often than not.

The wild card is the company's metaverse ambitions the ""metaverse"" being the next iteration of the internet that allows connected users to interact with each other and their surroundings in a 3D virtual environment. It will be years before the necessary infrastructure is in place to support the metaverse. But once there Meta's hefty investments could make it a key player in this potentially $30 trillion opportunity.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Sign up for it here.

It took me two years to post my first TikTok. I’d press “Record” mumble into the camera and hastily hit delete before anyone could see just how awkward I was on video. I took the plunge only after practicing enough to eliminate any telltale signs that I was a near-30-year-old trying to be cool. Or so I thought.

Apparently I’m still guilty of the “Millennial pause.” After hitting “Record” I wait a split second before I start speaking just to make sure that TikTok is actually recording. Last year @nisipisa a 28-year-old YouTuber and TikToker who lives in Boston coined the term in a TikTok about how even Taylor Swift can’t avoid the cringey pause in her videos. “God! Will she ever stop being relatable” @nisipisa herself a Millennial says. Gen Zers make up a larger portion of TikTok’s base and have grown up filming themselves enough to trust that they’re recording correctly. Which is why as short-form video comes to Instagram (Reels) YouTube (Shorts) and Snapchat (Spotlight) the Millennial pause is becoming easier to spot.

Unfortunately for me today’s most culturally influential social platforms are not geared around Millennials anymore and the pause is far from the only giveaway. Millennials—and their mannerisms—defined the online ecosystem that has ruled for a decade plus treating sites such as MySpace Tumblr Facebook and Twitter as the jungle gyms in their internet playground. But now that we’re well into the TikTok era the cracks are starting to show. Instagram and Facebook while still popular are attempting to capture the magic of TikTok by pivoting to videos and other ultra-sharable content that doesn’t come quite as naturally to Millennials (even ones born in the early 1990s like me). Now that Gen Z has all the attention the internet quirks that Millennials have called their own for years can feel a bit stale if not downright cringey. The first generation to grow up with social media in the mobile web era Millennials are now becoming the first generation to subsequently age out of it stuck parroting the hallmarks of a bygone digital age.

Once my eyes were opened to the Millennial pause I started noticing my age in every part of my internet experience. I get confused whenever Instagram changes its layout. I use GIFs to make jokes in Slack. I have posted song lyrics on my Instagram Story. The range of mannerisms is so broad the signs such a staple of my online behavior for the past 15 years that it’s not even worth trying to fight them.

Naturally Gen Z has picked up on them too and the mockery that was once reserved for Boomers is now coming for me. “The way the quintessential Millennial behaves online is basically a bunch of silly little nuances strung together to create a personality that is very giddy and excitable about the normal or mundane” Michael Stevens a 24-year-old TikTok creator based in New England told me over email. His impressions of Millennials have received millions of views on TikTok. Those “silly little nuances” include starting videos with a sigh doing dramatic zooms into their own faces for emphasis and using phrases popularized on Twitter and Tumblr—like “doggo” and “I can’t even”—in real life. “My husband just went to the new Trader Joe’s next to our house and I think it wins the internet for the day” Stevens says in a Millennial parody from July. “If this is adulting sign me up.”

Millennial internetisms exist because they were at one time the mainstream way of talking online. In 2014 someone tweeting that Parks and Recreation’s Leslie Knope and Ben Wyatt gave them “all the feels” would have been acceptable but now Gen Z just uses it as fodder for some secondhand embarrassment the same way that Millennials groan when their Boomer parents try to navigate an Apple TV. Millennial-isms have made for a whole genre of parody. On TikTok the creator Bianca Scaglione makes Millennial parodies for her 910000 followers specifically skewering their awkwardness on a livestream. (“And then they accidentally end the live by trying to do a filter” she captioned one impression.) Other creators have mocked Millennials for how they pose in photos (taking selfies from above is so over) for using Gen Z phrases (“slay bestie”) on TikTok for adopting something called a “BuzzFeed accent” when they talk to the camera. The list goes on: Millennials take Instagram way too seriously using portrait mode and filling their captions with forced puns. They love to turn their social-media bios into lists—for instance mine would read: “Kate. Ravenclaw. Cat mom. Knitting enthusiast. PA > OH > NYC.”

And given their need to insert themselves into every new internet trend Millennials are also sometimes active participants in their own critique. Since they can’t beat the Gen Z creators parodying them some Millennials have joined them re-creating the fashion hair and makeup of their youth in similarly popular videos.

Millennials aren’t the only generation that has been boiled down to broad and often unflattering stereotypes online: the notions that Boomers hate change for example or that Gen Xers are slackers. In 2019 the phrase OK Boomer took off online across both Gen Z and Millennial users as a symbol of collective exhaustion with battling the stereotypes handed down to them from above. That same year a Facebook group titled “A group where we all pretend to be boomers” launched; 285000 members still role-play daily posting pixelated memes about cars and asking things like “DID anyone ELSE LOSE POWER??”

But that kind of mockery is different. Although Boomers fell out of the internet zeitgeist they never had as far to fall as Millennials—the first cohort to watch their youth fade in real time with evidence of their growing irrelevance meticulously documented in memes trends and headlines published on the very internet they once reigned over. They’re no longer the hot new item brands are scrambling to attract nor the ones the world is turning to for the next fashion trend. The internet has moved on and Millennials can either adapt or like a Gen Xer still listening to Pearl Jam not care if their choices make them seem old.

None of this is necessarily a bad thing even if it bruises my ego. A 35-year-old desperately adopting the mannerisms of a 20-year-old is a different kind of cringe. Instead in spite of the occasional embarrassment the Millennial tics that remain have gone from trend to nostalgia. And besides when Gen Alpha comes for Gen Z’s internet you better believe I’ll have been taking notes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2hvbWUtdGhlYXRlci9sZy10b25lLWZyZWUtdDkwcS1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LG Tone Free T90Q review: Spatial audio for everyone,"LG Tone Free T90Q review: Taking a spatial shot at the AirPods Pro with a little help from Dolby MSRP $230.00 Score Details “Hyper-immersive listening and an insane number of features.” Pros Head-tracking spatial audio

Good ANC and transparency

Very comfortable

Wired listening option

Good call quality

AptX Adaptive

Bluetooth multipoint Cons May sound too processed for some

Let’s just get this out of the way: The $230 LG Tone Free T90Q not only look just like Apple’s iconic AirPods Pro — they offer almost all of the AirPods Pro’s signature features (and many it lacks) including head tracking spatial audio. That latter part is important though given that there are so many copycat earbuds that look the part but fall short where it really counts.

Apple’s AirPods Pro are known for many things like their superb noise canceling and almost magical transparency mode. But in the last year much of the focus has been placed on their spatial audio capabilities which use a form of head tracking for an extra level of immersive sound. And while spatial audio might not be everyone’s cup of tea Apple is no longer the only company serving it up on a set of wireless earbuds.

LG has brought in the big guns for its earbuds — the T90Q incorporate Dolby Labs’ head tracking tech. Does that matter? Given that Dolby more or less wrote the book on spatial audio when it launched Dolby Atmos it certainly should matter. But can the dynamic duo that is LG x Dolby outclass Apple’s aging knight in white armor? Only one way to find out.

What’s in the box?

The Tone Free T90Q ship in an admirably recyclable box. Inside you’ll find the Tone Free already inside their charging case with two extra sizes of silicone ear tips and two cables. One of them will look familiar (the USB-A to USB-C charging cable) and the other won’t (it’s a USB-C to 3.5mm headphone jack cable). What’s a headphone cable doing in a wireless earbuds box? Don’t worry it’s not a mistake and I’ll explain in a moment.

Design

In size shape and weight the Tone Free T90Q — which come in black or white — are very similar to the AirPods Pro. If you like the look of the AirPods you’ll feel right at home with the Tone Free.

Like Apple’s buds these are IPX4 water resistant which means workouts or the occasional splash of water should be fine — just don’t shower with them or dunk them in water. Each bud has a touch-sensitive area near where the stems meet the main housing for tap controls.

So far so similar but their charging cases couldn’t be more different.

Both offer wireless charging but LG goes further with “UVnano” a unique ultraviolet light inside the case that gets triggered whenever you place it on a charger or plug it in. LG claims that light can rid the tips of the Tone Free from up to 99.9% of bacteria. I’ve never thought much about ear bacteria but it kinda makes sense and if LG’s system even helps a little between routine cleanings I’m all for it.

For a lot of folks the big selling feature will be that little switch you can see on the case’s side something the T90Q has inherited from the Tone Free FP9. Flip it toward the headphone jack icon and it transforms the case into a hi-res audio Bluetooth transmitter which can be used with digital and analog audio sources using either of the included cables.

The analog cable (that one with the headphone jack on it) is perfect for airplanes or older TVs while the USB-A to USB-C is what you’d use to get digital audio — say from a PC or Android device. Given most of these types of digital audio devices already have Bluetooth the real benefit is being able to use the case’s aptX Adaptive capability because PC and Macs rarely use this hi-res audio codec.

Using this feature pulls power from the case’s internal battery and there’s no way to charge and transmit at the same time so keep that in mind if you decide to use it somewhere where there’s no easy access to an outlet. (Hmm … like an airplane?)

Comfort controls and connections

Thanks to a very ergonomic design and a smooth plastic surface the T90Q are super-comfy. And though they aren’t intended as earbuds for working out I found them to be quite stable and secure even at the gym. The only times they worked themselves a little loose was when I talked for 10 minutes or more but I find most earbuds I use do that too. Maybe it’s me.

Using the fit test built into the LG Tone Free app I could tell that even though the default medium eartips felt fine I needed the large size for a proper seal. I encourage you to do the same — comfort doesn’t always tell the whole story and an improper fit will lead to worse sound quality (especially in the low frequencies) and poor active noise cancellation (ANC). By the way I’ll be heaping a lot of praise on the Tone Free app in this review – it’s superb.

Regular readers of my earbuds reviews will know I generally prefer physical buttons over touch controls but the Tone Free T90Q’s touch controls are nearly perfect.

I say nearly because the one thing that’s less than ideal is the size of the touch-sensitive area. It’s located at the top of the stem and there’s a small raised bump to help you locate it but it still takes some precision to hit it accurately.

You do however get used to it over time. And thankfully the buds let you know when you got it right with an audible and satisfying click that sounds like a button-press.

You get single double and triple-tap gestures to work with plus a tap-and-hold option for a total of eight different commands. By default they cover all of the essentials: play/pause call answer/end volume up/down track skipping and activating your preferred ANC mode. But inside the Tone Free app LG lets you change these gestures to do whatever you want including the option to access your phone’s voice assistant.

Wear sensors let you auto-pause/resume your tunes when you remove/replace an earbud and it works almost instantly. Don’t care for that feature? You can turn it off in the app.

Getting the T90Q paired is a snap for Android users thanks to Google Fast Pair support (it’s pretty painless for iPhones too). And with Bluetooth Multipoint you can pair two devices simultaneously which works seamlessly between phones and computers. Once again the Tone Free app kicks it up a notch by giving you a device pairing control panel of a sort — it visually represents all of the devices you’ve previously paired to the earbuds and lets you manage those connections just by tapping. You can also force the earbuds back into pairing mode from the same interface by using the plus sign — so handy!

In my short time with these earbuds they proved to have a rock-solid connection but with Bluetooth 5.3 there should be little cause for concern. You can use each earbud independently for both calls and music.

That app

These days getting the most out of an advanced set of wireless earbuds means having a well thought out companion app for iOS and Android and I think LG has absolutely nailed that requirement with its Tone Free app.

It’s not only chock-full of features — in fact I can’t think of any that are absent — but it also lays those options out in a clean easy-to-use interface that doesn’t bury settings within multiple layers of menus or clutter things up with multiple tabs.

Sound quality

“Immersive” is a word that’s on the verge of being overused. But if ever there were a set of wireless earbuds that I can safely say will give you a heightened sense of immersion it’s the LG Tone Free T90Q. That’s both good and possibly bad depending on how you like to listen.

Inside the Tone Free app there’s an Equalizer Setting section divided into three parts. In the first part Meridian the storied UK audio group that has worked extensively with LG contributes five EQ presets inside the Tone Free app including Immersive and 3D Sound Stage.

A second part lets you toggle Dolby head tracking. Dolby’s spatial audio tech — which senses the movements of your head and adjusts the sound field accordingly — has shown up in earbuds before (notably the Galaxy Buds Pro) but the T90Q are the first set to let you enjoy its benefits on any connected device and any audio. The third part lets you set two of your own EQ preferences using an eight-band graphic equalizer.

These parts operate independently with each one giving you a specific type of listening experience. The Meridian presets — especially the Immersive and 3D Sound Stage ones — create a gigantic sense of space and presence. The soundstage feels like it extends outward in all directions with your head in the center of it all. Bass response (and just about everything else too) is big and bold. If you like EDM or hip hop you’ll be convinced that you’re on the floor of your favorite club. If you’re at the gym it will lend a new level of energy to your workouts.

Tracks like Edamame by Bbno$ and Blinding Lights by The Weeknd benefit the most from this treatment but it can also lend an energetic boost to arena rock standards like AC/DC’s Thunderstruck.

Immersive mode has a tendency to spike up the high frequencies at times to the point of harshness. But true to its name it feels all-encompassing. 3D Sound Stage tones things down a bit and pushes out the boundaries of space even further. They’re both highly entertaining as effects but I found they also produced listening fatigue after a while sending me in search of a neutral EQ. That’s where I ran into a bit of a problem — a neutral EQ is hard to find.

The closest thing Meridian’s presets offer is something called Natural which is way less processed for sure but still noticeably enhanced. Strangely when you jump into the Custom section to create your own presets the default flat EQ — which one would normally expect to sound pretty — sounds dull and lifeless. To bring some energy back into the mix requires some deft manipulation of those eight sliders.

I think the audiophiles out there already know where I’m going with this: these are not the earbuds for those looking for pure unadulterated stereo sound reproduction.

Now let’s talk about Dolby head tracking. It’s trippy. It works similarly to the version that Apple employs on its AirPods Pro AirPods Max and Gen-3 AirPods by treating the direction your head is facing as “forward.” The moment you turn your head the majority of the sound shifts toward the ear that is now in the forward position which creates the very effective illusion that the sound you’re hearing is coming from that forward position — not from two tiny speakers inside your ears.

That positioning isn’t absolute: if you keep your head turned the sensors will re-align the music in about 5 to 7 seconds giving you a new forward to work from. It’s probably not the best choice for the gym but when sitting on a couch or even on your daily commute it’s kinda fun.

Dolby head tracking works with any audio content to create a greater sense of space — that’s a big difference from Apple’s version which is strictly limited to Atmos Music and certain kinds of Atmos or Dolby 5.1 soundtracks. As you might guess Dolby’s version is also a natural companion to Dolby Atmos content whether it’s a movie soundtrack or Dolby Atmos Music. But I found that once I enabled it the effect was available for all of the audio I listened to including standard stereo tracks and TV shows.

Apple and Dolby’s head tracking also differ in how they manage the actual sound. With Dolby when you turn your head most of the audio stays in the forward position. Apple’s version is more subtle sometimes pinning only one or two elements like the vocals or lead guitar while the rest of the music follows your moves. Which is better? As with all things audio it’s a matter of taste. For movies I prefer Apple’s system. For music I’m happier with Dolby’s.

I mentioned it earlier but it’s worth repeating for those that care about Bluetooth codecs the T90Q support SBC AAC and aptX Adaptive for up to 24-bit/96kHz lossy hi-res audio on devices that support it but for those that don’t (or don’t support Bluetooth at all) the Tone Free’s clever case is a remarkable workaround.

Simply sliding the switch connects the case to the earbuds giving you the ability to hear analog or digital music sources via the included cables. I tried it with my laptop’s headphone jack as well as the machine’s USB-C port and both worked just fine although the audio quality from the USB port was much better.

Noise canceling and transparency

The Tone Free T90Q do an admirable job of ANC dealing very effectively with all but the highest sound frequencies. Whether it’s the roar of traffic or construction or the constant droning of a fan you’ll find everything’s a lot quieter with ANC mode turned on.

Between the AirPods Pro and the T90Q it’s hard to say which one does a better job — they’re very similar but if you’re looking for the best ANC at this price I’d say it’s still the Technics EAH-AZ60.

On the transparency side of things no wireless earbuds have been able to best the AirPods Pro and that goes for the Tone Free as well but it’s still more than adequate for letting in the sounds that matter be it a conversation or just all of the little cues that keep you safe while negotiating a busy intersection.

Switching between the two modes is fast and easy and you can choose inside the Tone Free app if you want to toggle between ANC transparency and off or any two of those options.

Call quality

The mics on the T90Q do an excellent job of preserving your voice with a full resonant sound that feels more lifelike and less like you’re talking through a metal pipe. That sound quality is at its best when you’re indoors and things are relatively quiet but it can still manage outside situations too — it just struggles a bit when competing sounds get really loud.

Thankfully wind proved to be very well-managed and it’s easy to switch to transparency mid-call so that you can hear your own voice more clearly.

Battery life

LG claims you’ll get nine hours of use from the Tone Free buds without ANC turned on and an additional 20 hours from the charging case. Those are decent if not stellar numbers but keep in mind that ANC and optional features like the use of a case as a transmitter or choosing to engage the UVnano cleaning when the case isn’t charging will take a pretty big bite out of both of those stats. I found that with ANC turned on and volume set at 50% I got just under five hours of playtime.

LG includes a fast-charge feature which can give you an extra hour of playtime for just five minutes of charging — similar to what you get with the AirPods Pro.

Our take

The LG Tone Free T90Q are an impressive set of wireless earbuds: comfy and packed with features that are both handy and innovative. And while their sound might not be to everyone’s tastes they bring a level of immersion to your music and movie experience that has to be heard to be appreciated.

Is there a better alternative?

If it’s an immersive spatial audio experience you seek two options come to mind. The first and obvious choice is the $249 AirPods Pro. They’re a bit pricier and don’t have as many features and they don’t play nicely with Android but if you’re an iPhone user they’re superb and have a fun and engaging (if somewhat limited content-wise) head-tracking spatial audio option.

The second choice is the $129 Sudio E2 a very affordable set of wireless earbuds that make use of spatial audio processing for an experience that can’t quite match the T90Q’s Dolby head tracking but that nonetheless offer a far more immersive listening experience than standard stereo.

Want fantastic (but far less processed) sound ANC and transparency look no further than the $230 Technics EAH-AZ60.

How long will they last?

If you’re careful with them the Tone Free T90Q should give you many years of service. Battery life will shorten over time so if you anticipate needing to listen for long sessions between charges keep in mind you may need to keep ANC turned off to do so.

Should you buy them?

Yes. LG has given the Tone Free T90Q a huge array of features for the price and I think that most people will really enjoy the combination of Meridian’s EQ presets and Dolby head tracking. The fact that it has very good ANC transparency and can connect to almost any device you can think of are the cherries on top.

From what was shown off in the first three Star Wars movies to the game-changing work done on Jurassic Park if you’ve watched an effects-heavy blockbuster from the last several decades there’s a decent chance that ILM worked on it in some form or fashion. For Lynwen Brennan executive vice president and general manager of Lucasfilm she sees the George Clooney-led The Perfect Storm as a movie that wasn’t just important for the company but VFX history overall.

I had the opportunity to speak with Lynwen Brennan as part of the press event for the docuseries Light & Magic which explores ILM’s origins and its impact on the film industry. and can be watched in its entirety with a Disney+ subscription now. During our chat I asked Brennan what she considered to be ILM’s greatest technical achievement whether that be a character creature ship or simply a general effect. She started off by saying the following:

There's so many and it's constantly evolving and constantly changing. My easiest answer to that is the last one we did because every day in this job we start at the beginning thinking ‘How we're gonna do that?’ Because everything that comes to us is really about solving a story problem or getting something on the screen that's in a director's head but we have no way of doing it. My favorite is the one that we’ve just done because then you have that euphoria of knowing that you pulled it off. Over the time I think often it's the ones that we know were the hardest to get done. So whether that be the water in Perfect Storm because if you think at the time that we were doing Perfect Storm digital water wasn't really a thing. And we took on a film where digital water was the main character in the film and had to do it in a believable way. Everybody knows what water looks like. They don't necessarily know what a monster looks like. So you can get a lot away with a lot more with a monster.

If you’re unfamiliar with The Perfect Storm the movie (which some might consider to be one of George Clooney’s best) was based off of the real-life story of the Andrea Gail a commercial fishing ship that was lost at sea during the 1991 Perfect Storm. Naturally since one can’t recreate such conditions in real life it was up to the minds at Lucasfilm to convincingly bring to life that violent water in a digital setting and make it work with the footage shot by director Wolfgang Peterson and his team.Along with George Clooney The Perfect Storm’s ensemble cast included Mark Wahlberg John C. Reilly Dian Lane and William Fichtner The Perfect Storm was one of six movies released in 2000 that ILM worked on the others being Mission to Mars The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle Space Cowboys Pollock And Pay It Forward.

More than two decades after The Perfect Storm’s release Lynwen Brennan is still impressed with how well the digital water turned out in the movie but that isn’t all she had to say about the ILM achievements that stick in her head. She continued:

So that's one that comes to mind that feeling of relief from when we actually completed the work on that to our current work in some of the digital human work we're doing. And then Stagecraft is another one where when we agreed to take that on at a budget and within a time we didn't know whether we were gonna be able to put it off. To be able to walk into that Volume and have your brain be so fooled it doesn't cease to astound me. So that's my current favorite anything that we're doing on Stagecraft because it really is quite remarkable how they're pushing that every single series.

StageCraft is the on-set virtual production technology comprised of video walls that was initially developed for the Star Wars series The Mandalorian and has since been used on productions not only set in a galaxy far far away but also Marvel movies like Thor: Love and Thunder and the upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and DC movies like The Batman and the upcoming Black Adam. These facilities a.k.a. “volumes” have already made waves (to borrow from The Perfect Storm) in the visual effects industry and even known how StageCraft came together Lynwen Brennan continues to be astounded by just what this technology can do.

The next Lucasfilm production coming up is the Star Wars series Andor and upcoming 2022 movies that feature ILM’s work include Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and Avatar: The Way for Water.

Pretty incontrovertibly it marks the arrival of a new star – which won’t surprise Reich whose immense ego and self-fascination is its presiding joke. “I will never not exist / Because I am life’s protagonist” runs one of several sung interludes that garnish the 23-year-old’s introductory hour. Here then is another – one of the best – of those shows that fashion the Gen-Z experience (performance as identity; everything commodified; a burning world) into uproarious bleak-brilliant comedy.

In doing so it clearly treads in the footsteps of acts like Kate Berlant Catherine Cohen and before them Bo Burnham. Reich doesn’t opine on his generational experience he embodies it parading his now-booming now-brittle self-regard before us like so many Instagram images. Like Berlant he considers the audience privileged to be in his company. Like Cohen he sings about having sex with people who hate him. But in Reich’s hands none of this feels stale as he hyperbolises the trauma of growing up queer bemoans the burdens of adulthood (“we are made to do the emotional labour of knowing stuff about things”) and posits Love Island as a metaphor for our troubled times.

Reich is an absolute master of this material delivering it with a camp flounce here an exaggerated pout there – and always in inverted commas. If now and then one of his many veils of irony seems briefly to withdraw isn’t the point that irony is the truth for Reich’s cohort of twentysomethings and artifice the mortar with which they assemble their personalities? Unable to recall his actual beliefs (he lost the phone on which he’d jotted them down) and vague on what he actually feels (there’s a rich running joke about how acting oppressed or happy triggers the same endorphins as the real thing) there’s a bleakness Reich incorporates into his work without any sacrifice of joy. The gags here after all – there’s a cracker about gay monogamy and the oppression of women – are top-drawer and the show a must-see.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5haHJhbS5vcmcuZWcvTmV3cy80NzI3NzIuYXNweNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,64% of Egyptian increased their use of digital payment solutions surpassing global rate: Mastercard - Tech - Business,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://english.ahram.org.eg/News/472772.aspx on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5haHJhbS5vcmcuZWcvTmV3cy80NzI3NzIuYXNweNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

~

Press Release San Diego 05 August 2022: General Dynamics NASSCO a subsidiary of General Dynamics announced today that it received $1.4 billion in US Navy contract modifications for construction of a sixth Expeditionary Sea Base ship (ESB 8) and two additional John Lewis-class fleet oilers (T-AO 211 and 212). This award comes in addition to $600 million already received to procure long-lead time materials for the same ships. The contract modification also provides an option for the Navy to procure an additional oiler T-AO 213 bringing the total potential value to $2.7 billion for the four ships.

“NASSCO is committed to working together with the Navy to deliver these much needed ships to the fleet” said Dave Carver President of General Dynamics NASSCO. “As partners with the Navy we remain dedicated to ensuring the success of both of these programmes to help enhance and expand the Navy’s forward presence and warfighting capabilities while providing sustained growth for our workforce.”

Construction of the four ships is scheduled to begin in the third quarter of 2023 and continue into 2027.

In 2011 the Navy awarded NASSCO with a contract to design and build the first two ships in the newly created Mobile Landing Platform programme the USNS Montford Point and USNS John Glenn. The programme evolved adding the USS Lewis B. Puller (ESB 3) USS Hershel ‘Woody’ Williams (ESB 4) USS Miguel Keith (ESB 5) the future USS John L. Canley (ESB 6) and the future USS Robert E. Simanek (ESB 7) configured as ESBs. ESB ships are highly flexible platforms designed to support multiple maritime-based missions including Air Mine Counter Measures Special Operations Forces and limited crisis response.

Acting as a mobile sea base this 784-foot ship has a 52000 square-foot flight deck to support MH-53 MH-60 MV-22 tilt-rotor and H1 aircraft operations. The future USS John L. Canley (ESB 6) and USS Robert E. Simanek (ESB 7) are currently under construction.

In 2016 the Navy awarded NASSCO with a contract to design and build the first six ships in the next generation of fleet oilers the John Lewis-class. Designed to transfer fuel to US Navy ships operating at sea the 742-feet vessels have a full load displacement of 49850 tons capacity to carry 157000 barrels of oil and significant amounts of dry cargo as well as providing aviation capability while travelling at speeds up to 20 knots. The first ship USNS John Lewis (T-AO 205) was delivered to the US Navy in July 2022. The USNS Harvey Milk (T-AO 206) USNS Earl Warren (T-AO 207) and USNS Robert F. Kennedy (T-AO 208) are currently under construction.

Nudi group vice president North American Retail.

Nudi participated in a question-and-answer discussion about the General Mills business June 1 as part of the RBC Capital Markets Consumer and Retail Conference. Conducting the Q&A was Sunil Modi RBC’s lead consumer analyst.

“We’re seeing 10 times the number of disruptions in our supply chain from an ingredient standpoint coming into our plans than we ever experienced before” Nudi said. “And this gets really challenging because we can’t see them coming in many cases. So a truck is supposed to show up with oil at our refrigerated dough plant in Tennessee and doesn’t show up. So we have to shut the line down. Obviously that creates lots of issues in terms of having the right amount of product and supply to our customers. And at the same time it drives a lot of incremental costs as well. So we have thousands of these material disruptions every single month now and it’s something that we haven’t seen before.”

A tight labor market has been a longstanding issue compounded by COVID which precipitated global supply chain problems Nudi said. The subsequent war in Ukraine and resultant material disruptions have created unprecedented challenges he said.

The difficulty isn’t completely around availability General Mills’ principal ingredient – grain. He said 90% of the company’s grain supply is sourced in North America.

“So availability is really not the issue for us” he said. “We have the ingredients that we need. It’s really price and it’s a global grain market. So we’ve been impacted by that... Starch frankly it’s something I didn’t realize what we use in so many different products. It’s really used as a processing aid and starch has been constrained for over a year now and that’s been a real challenge for us. Oil a little bit of knock-on impact of what’s happening in Ukraine has become a challenge from a supply standpoint. Even beyond that again I’m learning all kinds of things I didn’t know but oil has to ship in specific trucks that are built for shipping oil and have drivers that are specifically trained to drive this truck. There’s a shortage of those truckers right now.”

General Mills has disclosed its supply chain difficulties and how they have affected the company’s baked foods Totino’s hot snacks business and refrigerated dough. Conditions have improved Nudi said. The difficulties are also hitting the company’s pet food and treat segments as consumer demand for its Blue Buffalo Nudges True Chews and Top Chews brands continues to grow.

“If you look at our on-shelf availability we’re back to where we need to be” he said. “But then other things pop up. The oil issue that I talked about is a real challenge for us right now.”

The challenges have management’s full attention Nudi said.

“I have a weekly control tower meeting where I meet with our team on the biggest issues that we’re facing and really help try to break down barriers and do things differently than we’ve done before” he said. “So trying to build resiliency back in the supply chain will help us from a sales standpoint as well actually being better in stock levels and at the same time hopefully take out some costs over time as all these disruptions are very costly as well.”

While General Mills has experienced challenges associated with COVID and the tight labor market the difficulties have not been principally at facilities the company operates Nudi said.

“Our frontline workers showed up at work every day and kept cranking out products for our consumers that needed food and our products more than ever before” he said. “And we didn’t lose many of them throughout the pandemic obviously as people had family issues or health issues they would take care of those but they would come back. And part of it is we have a long history with these employees and we treat them well and they treat us well. So that’s been great.

“The bigger knock-on effect has really been at many of our suppliers have had real issues with labor. And I think that drove a lot of these ingredient issues that I talked about as well.”

He added that the company’s distribution centers have experienced labor issues but that those have been improving recently.

This might be particularly good news to cereal box collectors. According to Comic Book Frute Brute is ""considered by many collectors to be the most sought-after vintage cereal"" due to its appearance in various hit 90s movies. (A Reddit post helpfully points out where the cereal appears in both ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction."")

The popular mobile game Clash of Clans is celebrating its 10th anniversary and General Mills is marking the occasion with a special Barb’s Choco Boom Booms Clash Of Clans Cereal.



To create the new cereal General Mills teamed up with Clash of Clans to create Barb’s Choco Boom Booms cereal – which is a cult classic cereal based on the 90s racing game “Clash Dash.” For those unfamiliar Clash Dash is a Clashiversary racing game – a game that takes players through what it would have been like if Clash of Clans had launched back in the 1980s (instead of when it was actually released).



The new Barb’s Choco Boom Booms feature chocolatey-flavored frosted corn puffs cereal pieces and are available exclusively from Walmart.com (however it has reportedly already sold out completely).

Months after media personality Sheletta Brundidge called out Target and other large companies for making equity commitments but not investing in local Black media Target has signed on as an advertiser for her podcast network Sheletta Makes Me Laugh. The retailer which will begin airing ads on the network’s 10 shows in September joins a growing list of large Minnesota companies to support the Twin Cities-based platform including General Mills UnitedHealth Group and Comcast.

“All of a sudden I’m hotter than fish grease on Good Friday” Brundidge quipped in a recent interview with TCB. Brundidge an Emmy-winning comedian author mother and autism activist who was recently honored as one of USA Today’s Women of the Year hosts a Saturday show on WCCO Radio and does some fill-in work for the station. But after years of feeling sidelined by mainstream media she decided to launch her own podcast platform in 2020. Sheletta Makes Me Laugh draws around 25000 to 30000 listeners each week Brundidge estimated. The shows go beyond humor to cover finance parenting fitness and success with expert hosts including executive coach author and speaker Dr. Verna Price.

“I’ve been fighting for this and it feels amazing” Brundidge said. “I win and they don’t lose. I think [corporate sponsors] are starting to see the value in partnering with a Black outlet like mine.”

Target’s commitment

Target’s sponsorship of Sheletta Makes Me Laugh is part of the retailer’s commitment to spend 5% of its annual media budget with Black-owned media partners by the end of 2022. In May the company released an update on its progress reporting that Target has doubled the number of Black owned media partners it works with since 2020 and invested four times more with them compared to two years ago. Target also introduced a funding program from its in-house media company Roundel to increase the exposure of diverse-owned brands through paid media. The Roundel Media Fund will award $25 million in media to diverse owned and founded brands by the end of 2025.

Target touted its multiyear deals with large Black-owned media outlets including Revolt Essence and Black Love. In late 2021 when Target announced a startup competition show for Black Founders produced by Revolt Brundidge spoke out on social media saying that the retailer was ignoring local platforms with strong community ties like hers.

Target recently signed a two-month contract with Sheletta Makes Me Laugh which Brundidge called a strong start. She’s pushing advertisers for 12-month agreements which she received from General Mills Comcast and some others.

“This is not just a Juneteenth or Black History Month thing” Brundidge said. “They’re actually putting some weight on the promise. I needed to make sure they understand: we want to take your money but you also have to make a commitment to partner in community. We’re problem solvers.”

Advertisers as community partners

Brundidge urged General Mills and Children’s Minnesota to donate 1000 children’s books that she hand-delivered to the public library in Uvalde Texas following the shooting massacre that claimed the lives of 21 at the local elementary school. Back in April she arranged for one of her first big corporate sponsors HyVee to donate Easter hams to hundreds of North Minneapolis families.

“People are hurting—they need love. We’re in the community. People know us and trust us” said Brundidge who gets the calls from locals when they can’t afford a ham for the holiday. “These companies want an impact for their dollar. I’ve got people going out of their way to shop HyVee after they saw on my Twitter that HyVee brought an 18-wheeler full of hams to the neighborhood. You’re not going to get that in a 30 second ad. They’ve got to get out of the mindset of traditional media partnerships.”

That sort of grassroots support is exactly what Comcast wanted when the media and technology company engaged Brundidge’s platform to promote the Comcast RISE Investment Fund an economic development program to support small businesses. That let to promotions for Comcast’s efforts to get qualifying families in need connected to the Internet.

“We love her knowledge of the local landscape the reach and connections she has to help raise awareness. She goes above and beyond” said Jill Hornbacher senior director of external communications for Comcast Twin Cities Region which has a history of partnering with local influencers and diverse publications and platforms.

“Micro influencers are far more effective in delivering sales to the people who support them.” — University of Minnesota journalism professor Christopher Terry

These sorts of partnerships are the future but also University of Minnesota journalism professor Christopher Terry pointed out not all that different than the Golden Age of television when George Burns and Gracie Allen would be seen mopping the floor of their set with an advertiser’s cleaning products.

“If there’s one thing influencers have taught us: micro influencers are far more effective in delivering sales to the people who support them” said Terry whose research focuses on policy regulatory and legal analysis of media ownership. “For the quarter million it costs to get the Kardashians think how many ads these companies can buy with Sheletta. She can market to people in specific neighborhoods. That kind of targeting is very powerful.”

With the new funding Brundidge said she will be able to pay her podcast hosts and train the next generation of broadcasters and producers. “I’ve got to build generational wealth not just for me but for my community” Brundidge said. “I want to be able to pass out those Easter hams without calling HyVee.”"

Car parts especially those intended for premium vehicles and specifically those made by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) can be expensive. So it might be tempting to jump on a cheap part when you find one online. Mercedes is warning though that you might not want to.

The automaker reports that in 2021 alone authorities seized more than 1.86 million counterfeit Mercedes-Benz products in more than 650 raids. That’s an increase of six percent over the previous year.

“The counterfeiting industry has organized crime structures and often generates higher profits than drug trafficking” said Renata Jungo Brüngger Mercedes’ head of legal affairs. “We are working closely with authorities around the world in order to curtail these structures and combat threats to road safety.”

Through the pandemic Mercedes says that counterfeiters have increasingly moved online. Using social media channels groups can post parts online and sell them quickly making these methods very difficult to police against.

That’s why Mercedes says it’s expanding its strategic and operational measures to fight counterfeit products and the online trade in them. The company’s efforts will be based around three measures: detect attack and prevent. To that end it will be assigning “brand protection experts” to sniffing out suspicious offers online.

“The trading in counterfeit products on online platforms and social media is further increasing” said Jungo Brüngger. “Our brand protection experts have quickly adapted to the counterfeiting industry’s growing business model. In 2021 more than 126000 counterfeit products were removed from online platforms.”

If Mercedes’ commitment to this seems a little over the top to you it may not after you learn that some counterfeiters sell structural vehicle parts that could be of lower quality than a genuine part. The automaker claims in fact that the quality of these parts is often so poor that they don’t even meet minimum legal safety requirements like an aftermarket part might putting drivers at risk.

Parts are often also produced under inhumane conditions. In some cases environmental standards occupational standards and even human rights are not respected making these operations important to shut down.

It can be hard for customers to know whether they’re getting genuine parts or not but Mercedes says that buyers should look out for extremely low prices and should not buy from dubious online sources.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Here are some of the other legal challenges Jones and his company now face.

TEXAS CONNECTICUT LAWSUITS

Jones faces a separate trial over damages in the same Austin court for defaming the family of another victim of the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting. His lawyer said Friday that the case is on pause due to his company’s bankruptcy.

Jones is due to stand trial to decide damages in a different case in Waterbury Connecticut after he was found liable by default judgment for defaming families of several Sandy Hook victims with falsehoods about the shooting that killed 20 children and six staff in Newtown Connecticut.

Jones had called the shooting a hoax by the US government staged using crisis actors to serve as a pretext for taking away Americans’ guns. He has since acknowledged that the massacre was real.

The Connecticut trial which had been set to begin in September was put on hold after Jones’ company Free Speech Systems LLC declared bankruptcy last week. Jones said during a Monday broadcast of his Infowars program that the filing will help the company stay on the air while it appeals.

TEXAS BANKRUPTCY

In the bankruptcy case Sandy Hook parents told a Houston judge this week that Jones might continue to draw money from Free Speech Systems the parent company of his far-right Infowars website while using its bankruptcy case to avoid paying court judgments in the defamation cases.

The families have said Jones took $62 million from Free Speech Systems while burdening it with $65 million in “fabricated” debt owed to PQPR Holdings a company owned by Jones and his parents. They asked the bankruptcy court not to allow Free Speech Systems to send money to Jones or his companies until they have an opportunity to get to the bottom of Infowars’ finances.

POSSIBLE PERJURY CHARGE

A lawyer for the plaintiffs in the Texas trial on Wednesday disclosed that Federico Andino Reynal a lawyer for Jones had inadvertently sent him a file containing two years of Jones’ text messages along with trial strategy notes and medical records.

Jones has maintained that he searched his phone for texts about Sandy Hook and never found any. He denied on the witness stand that he had lied but the disclosure raised the possibility that Jones could be charged with perjury a crime.

Judge Maya Guerra Gamble on Tuesday admonished Jones for not being truthful during his testimony when he said he was bankrupt and had complied with plaintiffs’ requests for information before the trial.

Defence lawyers in Texas said perjury prosecutions are rare particularly for conduct in a civil case.

ATTORNEY REPERCUSSIONS

The judge in the Connecticut case on Thursday ordered Reynal and another lawyer for Jones to appear for hearings this month on whether they should face sanctions for the unauthorized release of the plaintiffs’ medical information apparently in reference to the disclosure of Jones’ records in Texas. Reynal did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter.

US CAPITOL ATTACK FALLOUT

The disclosure could also have implications for the inquiry by a US House of Representatives committee into the January 6 2021 attack on the US Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump. Mark Bankston a lawyer for the parents in the Texas defamation case said in court on Thursday that the committee asked him to hand over the text records he received.

What started out in 1985 as Cashback a Gaeltacht SME organising VAT refunds in Shannon for American tourists now has over 2200 staff is active in 120 global markets and has ambitions to become the leading software and payments company in Europe.

Original founders Gerry Barry Aidan Daly and Jim Ward checked out of what became the Fintrax business a decade ago with Barry and his family grossing over €100m for his endeavour. There is still a founder's family connection at Planet through Peter Daly who heads up the company's retail division. He recently announced that Planet plans to add 500 new jobs globally this year.

Planet is now owned by two large private equity investors Eurazeo and Advent International. The man with an inside view of how these PE giants have transformed Planet is Patrick Waldron (59) who was CEO for nine years until he retired in March 2022.

Back in the day Waldron used to handle retail marketing for Bank of Ireland. He progressed up the corporate ladder and was a key player in the 2000s when the bank was expanding activity in the UK. Waldron's entry into the Planet role was a roundabout route that commenced when Bank of Ireland tried to acquire Abbey National. That deal fell over and the bank was rebuffed by Alliance & Leicester too. Instead Bank of Ireland did a deal to become the banking arm of the UK's post office network.

""I worked on the due diligence for those businesses and in 2004 the bank asked me to relocate to London to set up and run the post office joint venture"" Waldron recalls. ""I thought it would be an adventure for a couple of years and I'm still here.""

Business Bulletin

Waldron was in the role for nine years when he got itchy feet. He was mulling a sideways move into insurance when he was approached by Exponent Private Equity. They had a deal lined up to acquire Fintrax and as Waldron hails from Cong in Mayo Exponent suggested that heading up Fintrax might suit. The Irishman demurred though he agreed to assist Exponent with the due diligence.

In 2012 American Express was also keen to acquire Fintrax. ""American Express do what they normally do - they agreed a price and then dragged out the due diligence"" says Waldron. ""Gerry Barry opened up the sale again Exponent bought the business and I joined Fintrax as CEO in November 2012.""

Waldron changed his mind about leading Fintrax because he did not have to relocate. His first learning under his new PE master was that his career outcome had become binary. ""You either do very well or you get fired in the first year"" he observes. ""That's why a lot of people don't take it on.""

The Fintrax business that Exponent purchased had two activities: VAT cashback processing and dynamic currency conversion. With DCC a hotel merchant in Columbia for example can present a bill to a customer in the customer's home currency. The facility enables Fintrax to win merchant accounts with the company charging a fee on each transaction.

Private equity strategy is to buy and build for the eventual flip. Fintrax was the number two VAT refund company in the world with about 20% market share and the business expanded market share in existing territories while Waldron overhauled Fintrax processes. ""Very quickly we tripled the profit to €42m and sold it to Eurazeo for €550m in 2015"" he recalls.

As Waldron explains it private equity operates at incremental levels. A typical Exponent fund would have €1bn to invest while at Eurazeo fund sizes are €3bn to €5bn. Exponent had tripled its investment at the Galway company in the space of three years and Waldron stayed on the for the next part of the ride.

With more financial firepower Waldron and Fintrax went on a buying spree. The most significant purchase was the 2017 acquisition of Planet Payment in the US for c.€220m. That moved Fintrax into the payments space so the company could process and acquire the transactions. Next on the shopping menu was a gateway and then Proximus which links everything together according to Waldron.

Another piece of the jigsaw was buying payments services provider 3C Payment a deal that Waldron describes as ""a brave move"" as it was executed in the midst of global lockdowns in July 2020.

With the annual profit run rate up to over €100m Fintrax now renamed as Planet came on the radar of Advent International a global private equity giant. In May 2021 Advent bought into Planet with Eurazeo staying on board in a deal that reportedly valued the business at c.€1.8bn.

Advent's arrival in Planet was despite the UK scrapping VAT cashback for overseas shoppers in January 2021. That move blew a large hole in the Planet tax refund business while Covid lockdowns in 2020 cratered Planet's tax refund activities globally. Accounts for Planet Payment Group Holdings show revenue declining from €41m in 2019 to €7m in 2020 and the net loss expanded to €98m from €10m the year before.

However there was no let-up in the deal-making for Waldron with five new buys in the first five months of Advent's involvement. Planet is still big in VAT refunds and DCC but the bigger play is to be the entire payments and e-commerce backend for hospitality and retail businesses.

Waldron observes that large luxury brands were late to online retail and Planet systems are bringing them up to speed. He instances order management capability that links into a retailerís stock management system so that if a product is out of stock in London but in-store in Birmingham Planet can arrange for the London shopper's order to be fulfilled.

""We can mix and match online and offline and bring it together"" he says. ""We can do that on behalf of the brands. This is their bread and butter so you'd imagine they would be good at it. Surprisingly many of them are not.""

For hotel chains Planet offers management systems that track and process guest payments all through their stay and the companyís reach also extends to systems for consumer retailers like Starbucks and Costa Coffee.

Planet is currently advertising 246 job openings 35 of them in Ireland. Technology and back office are concentrated in Galway with sales teams based in-country. Filling those roles is now the responsibility of Waldron's successor as Planet CEO Brent Warrington who joined from PayPal.

Waldron retains a vice-chairman role and reflecting on the Planet experience he references the on-the-job travel experience that would never have happened at Bank of Ireland.

""I've been to Japan and Korea about 20 times the same for Dubai and about ten times up and down to Latin America. You learn an appreciation of different cultures particularly the Asian culture which is soft and incredibly welcoming. In South America the culture wants you to dance everywhere while in the UAE it's very reverential in terms of how you conduct business. It was a tremendous learning experience.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitAFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZXhwbGFpbmVkL2V4cGxhaW5lZC1nbG9iYWwvZXhwbGFpbmVkLXdoby1pcy1hbGV4LWpvbmVzLXRoZS1hbWVyaWNhbi1jb25zcGlyYWN5LXRoZW9yaXN0LW9yZGVyZWQtdG8tcGF5LTQ1LW1pbGxpb24taW4tdGhlLXNhbmR5LWhvb2stdHJpYWwtODA3NTI3My_SAbkBaHR0cHM6Ly9pbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2V4cGxhaW5lZC9leHBsYWluZWQtZ2xvYmFsL2V4cGxhaW5lZC13aG8taXMtYWxleC1qb25lcy10aGUtYW1lcmljYW4tY29uc3BpcmFjeS10aGVvcmlzdC1vcmRlcmVkLXRvLXBheS00NS1taWxsaW9uLWluLXRoZS1zYW5keS1ob29rLXRyaWFsLTgwNzUyNzMvbGl0ZS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Explained: Who is Alex Jones the American conspiracy theorist ordered to pay $45 million in the Sandy Hook trial?,"A Texas jury decided on Friday (August 6) that well-known American conspiracy theorist Alex Jones must pay $45.2 million in punitive damages to the parents of a six-year-old boy killed during the Sandy Hook massacre on top of the $4.1 million in compensatory damages awarded to the plaintiffs on Thursday.

This was the first time Jones was financially penalised in court for the repeated lies he has told his audience about the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting of 2012. Soon after the death of 26 people in 2012 of which 20 were young children Jones had begun to claim that one of the deadliest school shootings in the United States was a hoax.

Jones had portrayed the lawsuit against him as an assault on his freedom of speech which is guaranteed by the First Amendment of the US constitution. He had previously described the proceedings as a “Constitution-destroying absolute total and complete travesty.” The parents who successfully sued him said his statements were so malicious that they fell outside the bounds of speech protected by the constitution reported the Associated Press.

Who is Alex Jones?

Alex Jones 48 is perhaps America’s biggest and most influential conspiracy theorist and has been spreading falsehoods for more than two decades on his popular website Infowars. He also broadcasts ‘The Alex Jones Show’ to over 100 radio stations reaching an audience of millions. He peddles unverified claims in his unique shouty style of delivery along with growls and yells occasionally rips off his shirt and punches the table.

Jones had spread some bizarre conspiracy theories. One such theory is that the US government is putting chemicals in the water supply to turn people gay and has even been able to “turn the friggin frogs gay”. He argued that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were not humans but demons from hell that smelled of sulphur. Jones has also been instrumental in the spread of the infamous “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory that a pizzeria in Washington DC is a front for a child sex trafficking ring involving Hillary and Bill Clinton.

According to a profile published in German news organisation Der Spiegel in 2017 two-thirds of Jones’s revenue comes from selling the products often mentioned in his shows like toothpaste “brain pills” bulletproof vests and potency pills. As a result his shows and product line have made him a very wealthy man. On August 5 a forensic economist testified in court that he estimated the combined net worth of Jones and his business entities was around $135 million and $270 million.

What was the Sandy Hook killing?

In a mass shooting 26 people were killed at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown Connecticut on December 14 2016. It took the shooter a few minutes from around 9:35 am to 9:40 am to massacre 20 children aged between six and seven years old and six adult staff members before he turned the gun on himself and took his own life.

The 20-year-old shooter Adam Lanzer had commenced the killing at his home when he shot his mother four times with a .22-calibre rifle. He then drove her car to the elementary school where more than 400 children ranging from kindergarteners to class four students were present.

Lanzer was armed with four guns that had been legally purchased by his mother – one 0.22 AR-15 style semi-automatic rifle two semi-automatic pistols a shotgun and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. Investigators found the shooter used the AR-15 as his primary weapon. The sheer magnitude of the violence and the fact that the majority of the victims were small children renewed the age-old American debate on gun control with proponents advocating for a ban on certain kinds of semi-automatic weapons.

What did Alex Jones do?

Disinformation campaigns are deliberate attempts to spread false information unlike misinformation which simply means wrong information being conveyed without the intention to do so. Alex Jones became a leading figure in spreading disinformation a lot of which began to surface very soon after the massacre took place.

Jones spread a conspiracy theory saying the killings never even took place. For years he has been arguing on his show that the mass shooting in Sandy Hook was a “giant hoax” and “false flag” perpetrated by the US government so that it could take away guns from the American public. He also claimed that no one died at the event and accused the parents of being “crisis actors” to sway public opinion.

However during his testimony as part of the defamation lawsuit on Wednesday (August 3) Jones said he now believes that the massacre was “100 per cent real” especially after he met the parents of the victims.

Neil Heslin and Scarlett Lewis the separated parents of a six-year-old victim named Jesse Lewis told jurors that for years they faced harassment and death threats by people that were convinced by Jones’s conspiracy theories aired on Infowars. “I can’t even describe the last nine-and-a-half years the living hell that I and others have had to endure because of the recklessness and negligence of Alex Jones” Heslin said in court on Tuesday (August 2). Earlier that day Jones had continued his usual diatribe on his broadcast program and told his audience that Heslin was “slow” and was manipulated by bad bad people as reported by the Associated Press.

Who brought the case against Alex Jones?

In 2018 Jones was sued for defamation by 10 families of Sandy Hook victims in four different lawsuits. The New York Times reported Jones was found liable by default in every case because he did not provide his financial records and other documents over the years despite being ordered by the courts.

The case decided this week in a Texas court was brought by Neil Heslin and Scarlett Lewis to determine the amount of damages Jones had to pay them for his falsehoods as he had already been found liable in September last year.

ARLINGTON Texas Aug 6 — Fans tuned in to the Adolis Garcia show at Globe Life Field on Saturday as the Texas Rangers beat the Chicago White Sox by a final score of 8–0. Garcia drove in five of the Rangers’ eight runs and it looks like his bat is beginning to heat up once again. Rangers fans are hoping that this sudden outburst of offense continues for Garcia. It would also be good if it rubbed off on his teammates as well. The fourth and final game in this series is set for Sunday afternoon. White Sox right-hander Lucas Giolito (7–6 5.06 ERA) will start the finale. The Rangers meanwhile will send their own righty Spencer Howard (2–3 6.82 ERA) to the hill. First pitch is scheduled for 1:35 PM Central.

The Adolis Garcia Show

The Rangers provided offense in several different ways on Saturday night on their way to a shutout of the White Sox. The game would remain scoreless until the bottom of the third inning. Rangers third baseman Ezequiel Duran hit a solo home run to right-center field to put the Rangers on top 1–0. It was Duran’s third home run of the season. Incidentally it was also Duran’s first home run since June 12 against this White Sox team at Guaranteed Rate Field in Chicago. He hit that home run in the 11th inning of that game.

Later on in the inning They extended their lead to 3–0 on an RBI single by right-fielder Adolis Garcia. Marcus Semien and Corey Seager both scored on the base hit. Their fourth run came in the bottom of the fourth inning. A wild pitch thrown by White Sox reliever Jose Ruiz allowed Meibrys Viloria to score from third base.

Five RBI Night for Adolis Garcia

The Adolis Garcia show continued in the bottom of the seventh inning. With the Rangers leading 4–0 Garcia stepped up to the plate once again with the bases loaded. He promptly blasted a three-run double to centerfield. Marcus Semien Corey Seager and Nathaniel Lowe all scored on the play. Moments later the Rangers would add another run to make it 8–0. Ezequiel Duran grounded into a force out that allowed Garcia to score from third base. García recorded five RBI on Saturday to tie his career high (for the fifth time) and season high for the second time (the first time was on May 15 against the Boston Red Sox. Saturday was his fifth game with five RBI since the start of 2021. No other Ranger has more than one such game over that span. All five of his five-RBI games have come at Globe Life Field.

Pitching Notes

Right-hander Dane Dunning started this game for the Rangers. Dunning earned his first win since April 30 against the Atlanta Braves (7 2/3 IP 1 R-ER) snapping a 15-start winless span that was the longest single-season winless span in franchise history. He pitched seven innings. Over the course of those seven frames he allowed only one hit and one walk. He also struck out six batters.

Dunning’s record for 2022 now sits at 2–6 with an ERA of 4.04. Right-hander Michael Kopech took the losing decision in this contest for the White Sox. He pitched 3 1/3 innings in which he gave up four runs all earned on five hits. He also walked two and struck out four. Kopech’s record for 2022 now sits at 4–8 with an ERA of 3.38. There was no save recorded in this game.

Chicago's lone hit against Dunning was an infield single up the middle by Yoán Moncada with two outs in the second. Yasmani Grandal doubled off Taylor Hearn with two outs in the ninth for the only other White Sox hit.

Dunning (2-6) struck out six and walked one winning for the first time in 16 starts since a 3-1 victory April 30 over Atlanta. Chicago traded the right-hander to Texas in a December 2020 deal for pitcher Lance Lynn.

Dunning had something to prove against his old club.

“It was just emotional for me. I felt just as nervous as much as I was at my debut” he said. ""It went away as soon as I stepped on the mound. I tried to slow myself down a little bit.”

The game was scoreless until Ezequiel Duran hit Michael Kopech’s first pitch of the third into the Rangers’ bullpen in right-center for a home run. With two outs two walks and a single by Corey Seager loaded the bases for García. He lined a 3-1 pitch for a two-run single and a 3-0 lead.

Kopech (4-8) got out of the third with a groundout by Leody Taveras on the 38th pitch of the inning.

García added a three-run double in the seventh equaling a career high with his fifth five-RBI game — all at home.

“I feel comfortable here” he said. “The fans love me they cheer for me. That makes me feel comfortable here and allows me to perform at my very best.”

The bespectacled Dunning is 2-1 at home this season. His win over Chicago was the seventh of his career at Globe Life Field tied for the most by any pitcher with Jordan Lyles whose seventh win at the stadium came four days earlier when the Orioles beat the Rangers 8-2.

Texas had won only one of Dunning's previous 12 starts but he was the losing pitcher in just four of those.

Rangers manager Chris Woodward pointed to how Dunning prepared himself mentally while on the 15-day injured list with a right ankle impingement in July.

“He's a competitor. It him him hard"" Woodward said.

Dunning came back with two no-decisions allowing four runs in 11 innings.

“When I was on the IL I used that time to reflect and be able to see mechanically what I was doing wrong. I'd had a loss of power and location as well” he said. “I wanted to be stronger with my front half and to ride down the mound better.”

On this night Dunning got 12 outs on the ground and only three in the air. He threw a career-high 103 pitches.

Texas had given Dunning just 3.45 runs of support per nine innings over the last two seasons second-lowest in the majors to Miami ace Sandy Alcantara (3.24).

Kopech was removed with two runners on and one out in the fourth. One scored on a wild pitch by reliever Jose Ruiz.

In his last six road starts Kopech is 2-4 with a 6.00 ERA in 27 innings.

TRAINER'S ROOM

White Sox: RHP Reynaldo Lopez (lower back strain) threw a simulated game. ""He was in command of it” manager Tony La Russa said. Lopez is expected to come off the 15-day injured list on the first day he's eligible for Tuesday's doubleheader at Kansas City.

Rangers: RHP Joe Barlow (blister on index finger) made his second rehab appearance at Double-A Frisco. He matched his first game Wednesday allowing only one walk in 1 2/3 innings.

DUST-UP

To end the bottom of the eighth Rangers left fielder Josh Smith had words with Grandal the White Sox catcher after Smith struck out.

""Hit his glove with a swing and maybe he did it before that” Woodward said.

The two earned the label at the 10th annual A Shot For Life Challenge at Starland Sportsplex in Hanover which raised more than $40000 for cancer research.

HANOVER — After two hours of bucket-getting Dedham graduate Avery O’Connor and St. Sebastian’s rising senior Trevor Mullin were crowned the Best Shooters in Massachusetts on Sunday.

“It’s a nice feeling to know you’re doing something out there to help and it’s a part of something you love as well” O’Connor said. “So it’s a really nice combination.”

While O’Connor was Sunday’s girls’ champion Nina Minicozzi a rising senior at Rivers who has committed to Dartmouth was named co-winner. Because of a scheduling conflict she took her shots on a different day draining 79.4 percent.

The challenge features free throws midrange shots and 3-pointers. Two hours of near-constant shooting is deceptively exhausting — O’Connor’s right hand was still shaking well after her final jumper. She paced herself with three-minute increments in her final 25-minute leg of threes holding onto her halftime lead to beat 17 challengers.

“Free throws I know I’m really good at those” O’Connor said. “So I got up as many of those as I could and same with the mid-range. And then [for] threes I kind of slowed my pace.”

Defending girls’ champion Avery Burns came to the challenge with crutches and a walking boot after undergoing right foot surgery this past week. The former Deerfield Academy and Nauset star didn’t plan to participate but after warming up and feeling the itch to join jumped onto the court to finish out her third year with the organization.

“In warm-ups I just started to shoot a couple and then was like ‘I’m doing it’” Burns said. “I came here to help out or volunteer or somehow be a part of it still and then I ended up shooting.”

Rising seniors Blake O’Grady of Dexter Southfield (73.7 percent) and Mia Mancini of New Hampton (71.8) finished second and third in the girls’ competition.

On the boys’ side Mullin faced stiff competition from rising seniors Liam McBride (86.3 percent) of Hingham and Joe Nugent (82.2 percent) of Tabor who finished second in 2021. Mullin tried to save his legs by shooting near the sidelines whenever possible.

Mullin dedicated the victory to his late grandmother Helen who died from lung cancer six years ago.

“Last year I didn’t place for her and I was a bit tight” he said. “But now winning it it was basically — this is for [Helen] right here.”

A Shot For Life began with the boys’ challenge a decade ago and has rapidly expanded orchestrating a 24-hour basketball “gauntlet” and All-Star games while expanding into baseball softball and lacrosse with future sports in the works. For founder Mike Slonina reaching 10 yearsis a milestone but not a surprise.

“I believe that we’re going to be a huge influence in the fight against cancer for the rest of my life and afterwards as well” he said. “We’re taking very measured steps to continue to scale to make that happen.”

Slonina created A Shot For Life after completing his own 24-hour challenge in 2011 to raise money after his mother was diagnosed with a brain tumor. Since forming the organization he has brought in more than 150 players representing some of the top talent in the state.

“It’s exciting because it takes so much work to be this consistent. We really had to build up the base of A Shot For Life for three years to where now our impact is really jumping exponentially every year. And that’s why we exist” Slonina said. “Ultimately we are a cancer research organization that uses sports not a sports organization that uses cancer.”

And Dylan Cease has been doing plenty right during a historic run.

The Chicago White Sox right-hander followed up a fantastic June with a July that was just as impressive. He was named the American League Pitcher of the Month in both months.

He allowed one run on two hits in six innings Friday in his first August start earning the win in a 2-1 victory against the Texas Rangers at Globe Life Field.

It was his 13th consecutive start allowing one or no earned runs. He’s the first starter (non-opener) in American or National League history to accomplish the feat according to STATS.

“Truthfully I don’t really think about it that much” Cease said of the stretch after Friday’s game. “I’m more focused on what I need to do to keep it going.”

Manager Tony La Russa credited Cease for avoiding distractions.

“The most important thing is the way that he’s handling it mentally” La Russa said after Friday’s game. “Feels good and he’ll come to work tomorrow and prepare for his next start. He’s done a terrific job of putting it behind him. And it’s what’s next.”

Cease is 12-4 with a 1.98 ERA and 166 strikeouts in 22 starts this season. He’s the first Sox to earn Pitcher of the Month honors twice in the same season and joins Chris Sale (twice) José Contreras (three times) and Mark Buehrle (twice) as the only Sox to win the award multiple times.

Here are three more numbers during the stretch that illustrate why Cease is in the discussion for the American League Cy Young Award.

0.59 ERA

White Sox starting pitcher Dylan Cease receives a high-five in the dugout after retiring the Blue Jays in the sixth inning on June 21 2022 at Guaranteed Rate Field.

Cease has a 0.59 ERA and a .174 opponents average during the remarkable 13-start streak. That’s the fourth-best ERA since 1913 over any 13-start stretch in the same season.

Hall of Famer and St. Louis Cardinals great Gibson tops the list with a 0.53 ERA from June 6-Aug. 9 1968. He won the National League Cy Young and MVP awards that season.

Jake Arrieta had a 0.57 ERA for the Cubs from July 30-Oct. 2 2015 in his Cy Young season.

Hall of Famer Don Drysdale had a 0.59 ERA for the Los Angeles Dodgers from May 5-June 26 1968. He allowed seven earned runs in 107? innings.

Cease has allowed five earned runs in 76 innings during his stretch that started May 29. His 1.98 ERA is the third-lowest by a Sox pitcher over his first 22 starts of a season since 1920 trailing only Gary Peters (1.50 in 1963) and Tommy John (1.94 in 1968).

“I’m just trying to do the same thing every start really” Cease said Tuesday. “The biggest emphasis and focus for me is what I have to focus on to actually execute. I try not to get carried away with anything other than ‘Hey what’s my focus today?’ I try to visualize it try to focus on it.

“I think that’s maybe where consistency comes from. I’m just trying to take the ball every day execute pitches and be stable and be someone that can be relied on.”

95 strikeouts

White Sox starting pitcher Dylan Cease delivers to the Tigers in the first inning on July 7 2022 at Guaranteed Rate Field.

Cease retired the last 13 batters he faced Friday. He concluded his night striking out Adolis García to wrap up the sixth inning.

He had five strikeouts Friday and has 95 during the 13-game stretch.

His 166 strikeouts this season rank second in the American League and he leads the AL with 12.18 strikeouts per nine innings.

“It sucks for me coming in after him because we have the same stuff but his is actually just better. That is not fun for me” Sox closer Liam Hendriks joked Friday after earning the save the 100th of his career. “Obviously he wasn’t as crisp as he would have liked (Friday walking three) but (he) was able to get us through six and keep us in position to win.

“After the first inning he was pretty much untouchable. That’s something that he does. He has that ability even when he doesn’t have his stuff even when he doesn’t have location or the crispness or anything like that he grinds through and makes sure he continues to put us in a chance to win the game. And he kept it to one run. This is a testament to his ability to mitigate the danger.”

8 wins

Cease is 8-2 during the stretch. He has won his last five starts a career-best streak. The Sox are 17-5 in his starts this season and 37-47 otherwise.

“What he’s doing right now is really good and he shows everybody that he’s competing right now and it’s good to be on his side” Sox left fielder Eloy Jiménez said after Friday’s game.

Jiménez hit a go-ahead solo homer in the fourth inning Friday. He has homered in 10 of Cease’s starts (12 total) over his career and the Sox are 9-1 in those games. Jiménez and Cease were acquired from the Cubs as part of a 2017 trade for José Quintana.

Cease who is in his fourth season is one win shy of matching his career high for a season (13 in 2021). His 4.1 WAR is tops among pitchers in the American League according to Baseball Reference.

“I’m really happy with where I’m at” Cease said Tuesday. “I’m never really content. It’s always a process but this is about as good as I could have drawn it up so far.”

Reynaldo López nears return from IL

Reliever Reynaldo López anticipates returning from the injured list for Tuesday’s doubleheader against the Royals in Kansas City Mo.

López who has been on the IL since July 25 with a lower back strain pitched a simulated game Saturday at Globe Life Field facing Tim Anderson and Gavin Sheets. He said he threw 20 or 21 pitches.

“I feel good” López said through an interpreter. “No soreness no pain. That was the most important thing: that I felt 100%.”"

Many young workers on the first few rungs of their career ladder do not see offices as welcoming places buzzing with collaboration and mentorship despite what their bosses promise.

Meanwhile many senior executives are mystified by calls for change to office systems and cultures that from where they sat looked like they were working just fine.

They weren’t. The pandemic showed a realistic alternative to the daily commute to the office and now many workers aren’t willing to go back to the status quo. Some two-thirds of those who have worked remotely during the pandemic do not want to return to the office according to a survey conducted by the jobs platform FlexJobs last year. A large survey taken in November 2021 of workers in 17 countries found that 71 percent of 18- to-24-year-olds said that “if my employer insisted on me returning to my workplace full-time I would consider looking for another job.” And they can for the moment at least do just that: In a tight labor market research suggests that recent college graduates have high expectations of their first jobs including work flexibility and alignment with their employers’ mission and values.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA4LTA3Ly1pdC1zLW92ZXItaG90dGVzdC1tYWNyby1zaG9ydC1vZi0yMDIyLWlzLWRvbmUtYW5hbHlzdHMtc2F50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Yen Shorts Crumble As 2022's Hottest FX Trade Comes to an End,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.bloomberg.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/articles/2022-08-07/-it-s-over-hottest-macro-short-of-2022-is-done-analysts-say (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D820DD3F0>, 'Connection to www.bloomberg.com timed out.

IRVING Texas — Read this story and other North Texas business news from our content partners at the Dallas Business Journal



On Thursday night Irving City Council approved incentives totaling $31 million for a forthcoming office development that is expected to be home to a new Wells Fargo regional campus.

For years sources have said that Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) was targeting hundreds of thousands of square feet of office space to house thousands of workers eventually settling on a build-to-suit option in the Dallas suburb of Irving after scouring North Texas.

The banking giant has settled on two 400000-square-foot buildings with the potential to hold 4000 workers that are expected to be set within a broader mixed-use development.

A spokesperson for the San Francisco-based Wells Fargo declined to comment again on Monday when asked about the office development which was directly tied to the bank for the first time by this week’s city council agenda.

Is DFW becoming the nation’s new finance hub?

While North Texas has a deep history of homegrown firms focused on private equity banking and wealth management the region has added to that might with the addition of several financial heavyweights over the past several years.

That includes snagging headquarters for Charles Schwab in tandem with its TD Ameritrade merger in addition to expansions from JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs among others.

A more recent victory for the region includes the approval of a half-billion-dollar Goldman Sachs-anchored tower in Dallas developed by Hunt Realty.

With $18 million in incentives tied to the project the investment banking giant is expected to retain or create a minimum of 5000 full-time jobs by the end of 2028 in addition to occupying 800000 square feet with a 15-year lease term.

Dallas Director of Economic Development Robyn Bentley said in June that Goldman was considering ""the full spectrum of headquarters services"" not focused on a specific facet of the business when it comes to the jobs that would be housed in the new office. Those roles could range from accounting to finance and from tech to corporate jobs such as human resources and legal roles she said.

Since 2018 eight Fortune 500 companies have relocated their headquarters to Texas with five of those landing in North Texas. Irving scored McKesson’s move from San Francisco and Catepillar’s recently announced pilgrimage from Chicago. Dallas is now the home of CBRE and AECOM both of which migrated from Los Angeles while Charles Schwab headed to Westlake.

Some sources believe that a Wells Fargo regional campus of this size meant for this many employees could mean an eventual headquarters move as well. A spokesperson said in June that the firm had ‘no plans’ to move its headquarters.

What will Wells Fargo’s future regional campus look like?

Two separate incentive agreements passed on Thursday night: consisting of $19 million tied to improvements in a Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone through the Financial Services and Economic Development Departments and $12 million to aid in the construction of the regional campus through the Office of Economic Development. The latter was approved unanimously.

In order to receive the agreed-upon incentives Wells Fargo or company affiliates must purchase 22 acres near Las Colinas Blvd. and Promenade Parkway by the end of the year; construct and occupy two office buildings that are a minimum of 400000 square feet that are at least 10 stories by December 31 2026; and construct a parking garage housing at least 4000 spaces; among other requirements.

AMTD Family

Growing Pattern









Even after a retail frenzy that saw GameStop Corp. become the hottest stock in the world and a dog-themed joke cryptocurrency gain billions in value the whirlwind trading in an obscure Hong Kong financial business stands out as spectacular.The rapid rise of AMTD Digital Inc. -- a barely profitable financial services firm -- is a tale that while reminiscent of last year’s meme-stock frenzy is even more mysterious. In a move that has puzzled the financial community the company’s shares skyrocketed in less than three weeks from their $7.80 initial public offering price to an intraday high of $2555 an eye-popping jump of more than 32000%.Perhaps even more perplexing unlike other publicly traded financial juggernauts that report hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue each year AMTD’s IPO prospectus lists total sales of just $25 million for the year ended April 2021. Still that didn’t stop the company’s market value from ballooning to $310 billion at Tuesday’s close making it larger than industry stalwarts like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of America Corp.“I’m not entirely sure what the business model there is but that hasn’t mattered to the Reddit crowd who are dipping in like piranhas” said Max Gokhman chief investment officer at money manager AlphaTrAI Inc.Much like the retail-induced mania of early 2021 which catapulted stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. to baffling highs before they plunged just as quickly AMTD’s run as a financial giant seems likely to be short-lived. Since hitting a record on Tuesday ATMD Digital has fallen by 57% erasing about $175 billion in market value along the way. That’s more than the entire current market capitalization of companies including Morgan Stanley  Intel Corp. and Goldman Sachs.Still it’s hard to pin the stock’s wild moves entirely on the retail crowd. While AMTD Digital appeared high on Fidelity ’s list of most actively traded stocks multiple times during the week it lacks a few key characteristics.For starters AMTD Digital doesn’t yet have any options available to be traded. Frenzied buying of call options was a hallmark of the GameStop and AMC stock surges. Trading volumes meanwhile have also been extremely low for a majority of the past week’s moves. Despite seeing swings of at least 40% in either direction on all but one day this week the stock has yet to crack 500000 shares traded on a single day. On Friday just over 50000 shares changed hands its sixth straight session of declining volume.As for the retail traders themselves even a cursory search of the top posts on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum shows a flood of denials of any involvement.AMTD Digital’s frenetic moves also led to extreme volatility in the shares of one of its parent companies AMTD Idea Group. That firm which is part of the larger AMTD Group umbrella owns roughly 88.7% of AMTD Digital’s outstanding shares. It too saw a wave of buying this week soaring as much as 520% on Tuesday alone.On Friday AMTD Digital announced that the underwriters of its mid-July IPO had decided to exercise their full greenshoe option. That means they’ll be able to purchase an additional 2.4 million American depositary shares at their listing price of $7.80 each roughly 99% below where they closed on Friday.AMTD Global Markets Ltd. was the lead underwriter on AMTD Digital’s IPO responsible for nearly 90% of the shares meaning it could potentially profit off its involvement.That’s all shone a spotlight on Calvin Choi AMTD Group’s chairman chief executive officer and major shareholder who’s currently facing an industry ban in Hong Kong for failing to disclose conflicts of interest when he worked at UBS Group AG.Already some firms are cutting ties. Billionaire Li Ka-shing’s CK Group said Thursday that it would sell its remaining stake in parent company AMTD Group Co.As shocking as the post-IPO surge for AMTD Digital has been it’s far from alone in such moves. On Friday another Hong Kong-based financial firm Magic Empire Global Ltd. made its US trading debut only to see its shares halted for volatility multiple times as it surged as much as 5799%.Other Hong Kong and Chinese stocks have seen similarly outsized gains after debuting in the US in recent weeks. At least five other companies including Ostin Technology Group Co. Golden Sun Education Group Ltd. and Intelligent Living Application Group Inc. have posted intraday gains of 395% or more on their first day of trading.Michael Burry the investor who famously predicted the housing crash in 2008 tweeted a screenshot of Magic Empire’s stock chart Friday and said “Gamblers gamble more the more they lose.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvbmVwb3Rpc20taW4tdGhlLWNpdHktdW5mYWlyLWltcHJvcGVyLWFuZC1lbmR1cmluZy0yZjZwNjBzcDfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nepotism in the City: unfair improper — and enduring,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvbmVwb3Rpc20taW4tdGhlLWNpdHktdW5mYWlyLWltcHJvcGVyLWFuZC1lbmR1cmluZy0yZjZwNjBzcDfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D820DC790>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvbmVwb3Rpc20taW4tdGhlLWNpdHktdW5mYWlyLWltcHJvcGVyLWFuZC1lbmR1cmluZy0yZjZwNjBzcDfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

The AIG Women's Open isn't the only major taking place in East Lothian Saturday. Sean Zak

NORTH BERWICK Scotland — This country doesn’t need your mega millions to “grow the game.” It’s doing just fine on its own.

Just down the street from Muirfield where the best women in the world are pegging it on one of the best courses on the planet there is the old Ladies Links. It’s nine holes each around 60 to 100 yards and has hosted golfers for over a hundred years. From members of the North Berwick Lady Golf Club back in 1888 to Luke List and some other restless Tour pros during last month’s Scottish Open. Today it goes by ‘The Wee Course’ and naturally it hosted the wee lads and girls Saturday morning.

“This is one of their uh majors. There are five of them” said proud dad Tom Halliburton. His 11-year-old son Aedan won this event in 2020 and was back for more. It’s called the Malcolm Cup an under-14 competition played every year on the Wee Course with five different trophies up for grabs across the field of 29.

Before the 11 a.m. shotgun start under a grey cloudy sky boys and girls covered the tiny practice green. Some grinded over 8-footers; others practiced their birdie celebrations. Moms carried clubs dads carried scorecards. Grandparents delivered an extra sleeves of balls just in case.

North Berwick is the type of tiny golf community that enriches itself just by being itself. Great golfers will grow up here because of the above paragraph. But others in the field came from across East Lothian and even the Lane-Fox family from Oxford. They’re summering up in Scotland for a few weeks staying at Grandma and Grandpa’s just off the 9th tee.

Sean Zak

Harold Lane-Fox and his brother Walker were late additions to the field. Harold joined Aedan little Harvey Blair and another older boy Luke McLaughlin. It was seven threesomes and two foursomes and because of that tournament officials reminded players to play quickly. They gleefully obeyed. Within seconds of the starting horn little Harvey had already slapped an iron up over the hill on the 1st.

There was running between shots because why not?

Players complimented each other constantly even from other groups. Ooh unlucky when a putt missed the hole. They learned that from their dads. It was a nice reminder that although the people most keen to “grow” some to-be-determined corner of “the game” are the professionals who took mega-million appearance fees the first golf coaches are always Dad or Mum.

The occasionally unfortunate truth is professionals matter a lot too. And you can see it in the mannerisms at the Malcolm Cup. The kids plumb-bobbed like pros marked their balls meticulously and stepped back off their ball visualizing shots. Luke raved about watching Catriona Matthew. Aedan’s favorite player is Justin Thomas. Harvey was among the lucky few to meet Rickie Fowler during a clinic at the Scottish Open last month. He was still wearing his Scottish Open hat Saturday morning.

I couldn’t get a favorite pro out of 9-year-old Harold — he couldn’t decide — but his favorite course is Gullane No. 3. He and his brother Walker play off the forward tees. The Lane-Fox family has a favorite game: three-ball sixsomes. That is alternate shot played by three two-man teams chosen at random between Mom and Dad Harold and Walker Grandma and Grandpa. No sport accommodates generations like this one.

Mom Chrissy grew up in Kansas but now has one of those split accents that comes from many years abroad. She never played golf growing up but she does now that she lives in Scotland. She attributes it to the barrier-free nature of golf here. They call this nook of the country the “Golf Coast.” It’s cheap social and all are welcome.

“You can play with men in their 50s and older ladies in their 80s” she said. “And you can always have a good game.”

She’s right.

There was plenty on offer at the Malcolm Cup. Sean Zak

Chrissy carried Harold’s bag and was the unofficial chaperone of the group teaching pace reminding who had the honor keeping track of who was keeping track of each other’s scores. They whipped around fast as they could 75 minutes of birdies pars bogeys and doubles. Before long every competitor and their toting parents gathered around the starter shed to hand in their scores. The top eight would advance to match play. Anyone else who wanted to keep playing would be grouped up for separate nine-hole rounds. There were still four more trophies to give out.

The tournament official began reading the names of the lucky eight advancing to match play. Aedan’s name came first. Luke’s came next. Harold and Harvey waited next to each other anxious to see if their score was good enough. Finally Harold’s name was called followed immediately by Harvey’s. Their faces said it all — a blend of Wow I made it and Hoo boy here comes match play. All four players from the group had made it through stroke play and now they were about to compete head-on. They grabbed their scorecard and bags and eagerly turned to the 1st tee.

""The Biggest Little Fair in the World"" is set to open Sunday with an entire return to normal after a COVID-related cancellation of everything except for junior fair events statewide in 2020.

Fair Manager Rod Arter said ""it's a different feeling"" seeing a return to normalcy for the fair after the previous couple years during the COVID pandemic.

""We had a pretty full fair last year. We were down a few exhibitors and entries because some people were still a little skeptic"" Arter said. ""All our entries seem to be back up to normal and all our sponsorships.""

Among the biggest changes to the fair this year he said is the opening of a beer garden behind the grand stands in the evenings. He noted people can carry beer around about half of the race track in the midway and commercial buildings but beer will not be permitted in the barns or the 4-H areas. Arter added the fair will have four types each of beer and seltzer.

According to Arter Intel has also sponsored a premium bank for the fair. He explained if someone shows livestock and wins money the fair has a bank at the fairgrounds and will pay the junior fair member cash. Arter said all that money will be coming from Intel.

Lisa McCutcheon extension educator of the 4-H Youth Development Program at the Ohio State University Licking County Extension said although their programs were back to full last year this year it will be full swing like before the pandemic. She said they expect much better attendance at this year's fair.

Out of the townships from Licking Delaware and Knox Counties that are included in the Hartford Fair District McCutcheon said they have some 1700 junior fair exhibitors this year.

""I think they're really excited. For many of our exhibitors this is a premiere week. They not only get to exhibit and show off their hard work but they get to spend time with family and friends"" McCutcheon said adding a lot of people camp at the fair so many exhibitors will spend the entire week at the fair.

McCutcheon encouraged people to look at the fair's schedule and determine a time they can visit and see what the fair has to offer. She said their kids put a lot of time and work into the whole year regardless of whether they're showcasing in the livestock or project barns. She said there's a lot to see beyond the food rides and entertainment.

Last year The Hartford Fair only had rides six days due to some staffing challenges for the ride company. Arter said this year the fair board hired a new ride company and will offer rides all seven days.

This fair marks Arter's first fair as manager although he previously served as a fair board member for 28 years and prior to that served as an electrician for the fair many years. Arter said he vowed to serve as fair manager for the next five years.

During his tenure Arter said he hopes to move The Hartford Fair into the next generation. He hopes to start with offering online admission tickets.

""We're trying to make things more easier and comfortable for the fairgoers"" he explained.

According to Arter his father also served as fair manager previously. Arter said he grew up being involved in the fair and took his dad's fair board seat when he passed.

""The fair is in my blood there's no doubt about that"" he said.

The Hartford Fair is also participating in a ""stock the trailer"" contest. People can participate by bringing non-perishable food items to the Hartford Fair for the Food Pantry of Licking County. Financial donations are also being accepted with that money being used to purchase food items.

Food and donations can be dropped off to the stock trailer located at the front of Grubb Arena or the Junior Fair Board Office at The Hartford Fair.

Submitted

West Hartford Community Theater proudly presents tick tick… BOOM! an autobiographical musical written by Jonathan Larson the Pulitzer Prize- and Tony Award-winning composer of Rent.

Different from the 2021 major motion picture directed by Lin-Manuel Miranda this is the musical version that started it all with its off-off Broadway debut in 2001 leading to multiple national and international productions national tours and two revivals in 2014 and 2016.

The show tells the story of an aspiring composer questioning his life choices on the eve of his 30th birthday. His girlfriend wants to get married and move out of the city his best friend is raking it in on Madison Avenue but Jonathan is still a waiter trying to finish writing his musical. His fuse has been lit. How much time does he have left before he can achieve his dreams? Or will it all just blow up in his face? This exhilarating funny and moving work by the late Larson will speak to anyone who’s ever gotten lost on the way to finding their dreams.

Directed by Corinne Kravetz with Musical Director David Jarkey the three-person cast features Brandon Allen as Jonathan Reilly Lincavicks as Susan and Henley Solomon as Michael. Guided by Co-producers Theresa Szymanski and Marybeth Lavelle this musical marks a departure from the larger musicals West Hartford Community Theater fans have come to expect.

“Coming off of the restrictions theaters faced during the pandemic we chose this play specifically for its smaller cast. We then discovered that just like in the Broadway productions this smaller cast really enhanced the intimacy of the show” says Szymanski. “Just like the Broadway version our show has multiple characters all portrayed by just three actors and it really heightens the passion and excitement; it really intensifies the relationships depicted. It deepens the whole experience” says Lavelle.

Theater lovers in Connecticut may recognize director Corinne Kravetz from her previous work as former acting teacher and director at Conard High School and a variety of experiences with other local schools.

About her newest directorial work on tick tick…BOOM! Kravetz says “Any time I get to direct an exciting show like this it’s great. But with these incredibly talented actors it’s very special. Everyone is so excited to bring this beautiful piece of theatre to life onstage in front of a live audience. We can’t wait to share this very relevant show with everyone!”

Musical Director David Jarkey described the cast’s singing ability “Brandon Reilly and Henley are not to be missed. They are vocal powerhouses.”

The show runs four nights Sept. 9-10 and 16-17 2022 at The Theater at Braeburn School 45 Braeburn Road in West Hartford CT. Tickets cost $25 in advance and $30 at the door (students $20 in advance $25 at the door with valid student ID). The show is expected to sell out so those interested are strongly encouraged to buy tickets in advance. Please note this show contains some language and situations which may not be suitable for younger audiences.

One of these is through their incredibly popular GI Joe Classified Series of action figures. This line of 6in figures takes the classic Joe and Cobra figures and gives them either a more modern design or a new design inspired by their classic look from the 1980s.

RELATED: HASBRO RELEASING EPIC SPIDER-MAN MARVEL LEGENDS COLLECTION ON 4/20

Recently Hasbro sent out a special box of free GI Joe items to influencers to take a look at what they have to offer for “A Real American Hero.”

NEWEST GI JOE FIGURES

Some of the newest figures to come out in the GI Joe Classified Series include Spirt Iron-Knife and Storm Shadow. While this is not the first release for Storm Shadow in this line it is the first time Hasbro is making one based on his original design.

Spirit includes his pet eagle Freedom as well as a number of accessories that can be clipped onto the figure. That’s one of the biggest draws of the Classified Series; as with most figures nearly all of them have some sort of storage for their weapons that are included.

In the case of Spirit you can position Freedom either on his backpack or on his arm and with Storm Shadow there is an optional hood piece along with storage for an arrow bow and swords on his back. These figures are shipping now from online retailers and should be in stores soon.

ANIMALS AND TROOPERS

One of the best figures to enter the line is the new release of Croc Master & Fiona. This set includes not only the first release of Croc Master inspired by his classic look but Hasbro gets to show off the incredibly talented engineering that goes into the Classified Series with the crocodile Fiona. Fiona is a fully articulated crocodile that is sure to be a challenge to any Joe figure in your collection.

Cobra’s army can continue to grow with the many troopers released in the line. In this box Hasbro sent over the Target Exclusive Python Patrol Cobra Viper figure. This one is part of their special line of figures for Target and with this one it features a special paint job not seen on the regular Cobra Viper being released in an upcoming three-pack.

RELATED: HASBRO REVEALS NEW G.I. JOE ACTION FIGURES & PRE-ORDERS DURING FANSTREAM

Speaking of Cobra Troopers exclusive to Hasbro Pulse are the Retro O-Ring figures of the Cobra Trooper and Officer. These special GI Joe releases recreate the iconic O-Ring 3.75in action figures fans know and love down to the original packaging.

BRINGING BACK RETRO GI JOE

Also included was the Retro Classified Series Baroness figure that is exclusive to Walmart. Similar to the O-Ring figure sets these recreate the iconic 1980s packaging but this time with a full 6in Classified Series figure on the card back. There is a whole set of these available at Walmart and even more launched at Walmart Collector Con!

Speaking of Retro there is a number of places you can get new versions of classic G.I. Joe products today! Up on Hasbro Pulse until August 16th is the HasLab Classified Series 6in scaled H.I.S.S. Tank which just reached its final unlocked stretch goal in record time. You can also catch classic episodes of the G.I. Joe cartoon series on the Hasbro YouTube channel and follow the brand on social media @GIjoe on Instagram @GIJoeOfficial on Twitter and @OfficialGIJoe on Facebook!

HeroQuest was relaunched last year after the original Games Workshop version ceased production in the 1990s. The revised HeroQuest started out as a crowdfunding campaign on Hasbro Pulse and hit the market during the Christmas season of 2021.

The game has proven popular as it has received several expansions. The Frozen Horror an expansion for the original game is also being reimagined and should be on the market this September.

Invest in These 3 Stocks,"Investing roughly $55500 across these stocks will be enough to generate $300 in monthly dividend payments.

Passive income is the best type of income -- it doesn't require you to do any work for it. In the case of dividend stocks all you need to do is buy shares of a company that pays a good safe yield and watch the recurring payments boost your portfolio's balance.

And although it can be difficult to find dividend stocks that pay every month one way around that is to buy multiple stocks. With just three dividend stocks that pay at different schedules you can collect passive income on a monthly basis.

Here's how investing in Healthpeak Properties (DOC 1.57%) Lumen Technologies (LUMN 4.69%) and Altria (MO 0.95%) can generate $300 in dividend income for your portfolio each month.

1. Healthpeak Properties

Healthpeak is a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on the healthcare industry. It invests in life science campuses medical offices and continuing-care retirement communities. It has a diverse tenant mix that makes it an ideal dividend stock for risk-averse investors to own.

This year the company projects that its funds from operations (what REITs normally rely on instead of net income) will total $1.70 per share or greater. That leaves plenty of room to cover its dividend payments which will total $1.20 per share during that same time frame.

At 4.3% Healthpeak pays more than twice the S&P 500 average of 1.6%. If you were to invest approximately $27900 into the stock you would collect a $300 dividend every quarter. Healthpeak pays a dividend normally at the end of February or early March along with payments in May August and November.

2. Lumen Technologies

Lumen is the highest-yielding stock on this list paying 9.2% per year in dividends. That high of a yield may be worrisome but the company's payout ratio has actually been very manageable at under 50%.

The telecom company unfortunately hasn't been a great buy over the past five years losing more than half of its value over that period as its sales numbers have been declining. However that could change as Lumen is in the process of upgrading its network onto its new Quantum Fiber service which will improve speed and should lead to more growth in the business. This should make Lumen a more tenable investment for the future.

Lumen makes dividend payments every March June September and December. And given its high yield you'll only need to invest roughly $13000 to collect $300 in quarterly dividend payments from the stock.

3. Altria

Another high-yielding stock that can generate lots of passive income for you is tobacco maker Altria. It has an impressive track record as a Dividend King raising its payouts for decades.

However its future is a bit hazy as the U.S. government is looking to crack down on nicotine levels in cigarettes and wants to ban Juul -- an e-cigarette company that Altria had invested in a few years ago. As a result Altria's future remains murky but it certainly does have options it can pursue to generate growth including pivoting to cannabis.

The government's latest moves suggest there is a bit of risk with Altria but legislation can take years to drag out and with plenty of cash still coming through its business the company has time to strategize as to how it can address those issues (if and when they do take place). Over the trailing 12 months Altria's free cash flow totaled $8.1 billion -- 24% higher than the $6.5 billion it paid out in dividends during that time.

For the foreseeable future this is still a safe dividend stock to own. It pays an 8.2% yield which means that you would need to invest approximately $14600 into the tobacco giant to collect $300 from its quarterly dividend payments which normally take place every January April July and October.

By investing in Altria and the other stocks noted you can ensure that you're collecting a dividend on a more regular basis than just every three months.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Bourque will have his number 17 retired at Giant Center on January 14 before a home game against the Springfield Thunderbirds.

Bourque will become the eighth player in franchise history to receive the distinction. His number 17 will become the fifth number in team history to hang from the rafters.

“Chris Bourque is one of the greatest players to ever wear the Chocolate and White and it’s only fitting that his number 17 be raised to the rafters among the finest players in our organization’s rich history” Bryan Helmer the Bears’ vice president of hockey operations said in a press release. “Chris is synonymous with the success the Bears enjoyed during his playing days and the impact he had in Chocolatetown is timeless. We’re excited to be able to honor his legacy with his friends family and our fans on Jan. 14.”

The Boston native announced that he was retiring from pro hockey last April. He had spent the last three seasons playing in Germany’s Deutsche Eishockey Liga.

Bourque the son of Hockey Hall of Famer Ray Bourque was originally drafted by the Capitals in the second round of the 2004 NHL Draft. He played nine seasons with Hershey over three separate stints and ranks fifth all-time in team history in scoring collecting 586 points over 604 regular season games. Bourque helped the Bears to three Calder Cup championships (2006 2009 2010) and is the only person in franchise history to claim three championships as a player. He is also the franchise’s all-time leader in playoff scoring (86 points) and playoff games played (106). Bourque’s 82 career playoff assists are the most by any player in league history.

Bourque ends his career ranked 20th in AHL scoring all time recording 746 points in 794 games in parts of 13 seasons with Hershey Providence Hartford and Bridgeport. He also played in 51 games in the NHL including 13 with the Capitals.

The last time Hershey celebrated a player by retiring their number came in 2002 when the Bears added defenseman Ralph Keller’s name to the number 3 banner previously hung in 1991 to honor former defenseman head coach and general manager Frank Mathers. Mike Nykoluk Arnie Kullman Tim Tookey Willie Marshall and Mitch Lamoureux are the other players that pre-date Bourque.

The Hershey Bears American Hockey League affiliate of the Washington Capitals announced on Saturday that the team would be retiring the No. 17 jersey during the 2022-23 season for forward Chris Bourque the son of NHL great Ray Bourque.

Drafted by the Capitals with the 33rd overall pick in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft Bourque failed to crack an NHL lineup during his professional career (he played 51 games with three NHL clubs) but spent parts of nine seasons during his professional career with the Chocolate and White helping the club to three Calder Cup championships in 2006 2009 and 2010.

The Bears posted a video of Hershey Bears Vice President of Hockey Operations (and a former teammate of Bourque’s) Bryan Helmer calling the Boston Massachusetts native with the news.

The ceremony which will take place on January 14 2023 will be the first such event to grace Hershey since the Bears added alumni Ralph Keller’s likeness to the No. 3 banner already raised for Frank Mathers. Just one other player in franchise history the late Mike Nykoluk (who spent 14 seasons in a Bears sweater) has been solely honored with a number retirement.

Lewis-Neely also shared her happy news on Instagram posting the same pic of her son. ""Noah Tayloe Taylor is finally here!"" the first-time mom wrote. ""We're so in love already and he's so sweet. What a true blessing it is to bring this beautiful bundle of joy into the world.""

Neely first announced that Noah had been born on Instagram Wednesday.

""Noah is HERE!!!!! 6 lbs. 4 oz."" the proud grandmother captioned a celebratory selfie from the hospital in which she is holding a blue balloon. ""My heart is about to explode! 💙💙💙💙.""

""I had to kind of take a step back because Spenser she checked me on it. I pressed her and she said 'But Mom who said it was right that way?' "" she went on. ""And I realized I thought that because my mama got in my head and her mama in hers and her mama in hers etc. etc. This generation they're not doing that. So I had to snap out of it.""

In September 2020 Suarez Navarro announced she was diagnosed with Hodgkin Lymphoma.

Fortunately Suarez Navarro's battle with cancer went smoothly as she was declared cancer-free the following year and was able to return to the Tour. After returning to action Suarez Navarro represented Spain at the Tokyo Olympics and the Billie Jean King Cup Finals before she retired from the game at the end of the season.

""I was diagnosed with lymphoma in late 2020 and it was a surprise"" Suarez Navarro said in a video for the WTA's YouTube channel per Sportskeeda. ""You never expect it but luckily everything went well. As I've said many times you may feel fine or appear to be fine but deep down that's not the case.

I think getting check-ups going to the doctor getting tests done is very important especially to detect possible future illnesses.""

Suarez Navarro on the WTA teaming up with Hologic

This year the WTA signed a partnership deal with medical technology company Hologic.

Hologic is primarily focused on women's health and Suarez Navarro thinks the WTA made the right decision by partnering with the company. ""I think it's a very positive partnership it's also very important for female players"" Navarro said.

""I believe they will be more protected. They will also be more aware of the importance of health. I have personally suffered from it so I'm happy that a company like this wanted to partner with a group of women. Hopefully as time goes on women and female players will become more aware of these yearly checks."" Suarez Navarro 33 has been fortunate enough to beat cancer and now she is advising everyone not to underestimate the importance of regular check-ups.

""The message I would give to everyone about health would be to tell them about the importance of health visiting the doctor and getting regular check-ups"" Navarro said. ""It is very important to detect possible illnesses. Detecting them in time can save many lives.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

The suspect then picked up the box and walked out of the store.

The suspect was described as a Hispanic male adult approximately 5’9” tall. He was wearing blue jeans a grey-colored gator covering his face a tan-colored hat a black shirt with a star on the back and a grey-colored long sleeve shirt underneath with a black wrist watch on his left wrist.

MCDONOUGH GA — A man who bears an uncanny resemblance to award-winning actor Bradley Cooper is wanted by police for stealing from an Atlanta-area Home Depot according to authorities.

In a photo posted to Facebook the Henry County Sheriff's Office asked the public's help identifying the suspect who they say stole a Bosch rotary laser kit from the store on July 23. Facebook users were certain they nailed the culprit.

""Well this is easy. Bradley Cooper. There ya go"" wrote one user. ""Bradley Cooper has seen better days"" another quipped.

""Bradley Cooper stealing? He's really far from the shallow now..."" one user wrote referencing the song from Cooper's hit movie ""A Star Is Born.""

Tyler was 30 years old a graduate of Dartmouth High School and Bridgewater State University when he took his own life in 2018.

His uncle Joel Baptista said Tyler's smile could light up a room but it was amazing how much that smile could hide.

""We saw some signs and help was provided but sometimes the pain is just too much and people can't see the light at the end of the tunnel"" Baptista said. ""We have a close-knit family but we just didn't know it would come to that.""

Jenelle Hickey is the coordinator of a program at Child and Family Services that assists young people at risk of suicide giving them the help they need to hopefully move forward.

Both Baptista and Hickey joined Townsquare Sunday this week to discuss suicide in our area.

After Tyler's death Baptista said his family decided to form a foundation to assist organizations working with young people on suicide prevention. That organization is Child and Family Services and Janelle Hickey's CBAT unit.

""We work with kids (ages) four to 17 who are in an acute mental health crisis"" Hickey said. ""That might mean depression anxiety or having suicidal thoughts and feelings.""

She said youngsters in the program stay about two weeks while personnel work on getting them to feel better.

CBAT currently has nine beds but it will grow to 15 when the program moves to the former Regal House building on Church Street sometime after the New Year. Hickey said her program is always full and sadly it's not uncommon for people at risk to have to wait for placement.

The Tyler Joseph Leonard Memorial Foundation will hold a fundraiser on September 10 from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. at the Allendale Country Club in Dartmouth. It will feature music dancing a silent auction and much more.

Proceeds from the event will fund a scholarship for a Dartmouth High School student and the CBAT program at Child and Family Services. For information and tickets visit thetylerjosephleonardmemorialfoundation.org.

Paso Robles police announced this week the arrest of one suspect and identification of a second suspect in an armed robbery of the Carl’s Jr. on Black Oak Drive on July 21.

At about 6:30 a.m. the robber entered the restaurant armed with a small black semi-automatic style handgun. He then ordered the two employees into a freezer where he instructed them to stay for 10 minutes. The robber took an undisclosed amount of cash.

Officers arrested 24-year-old William Caraway of Paso Robles on charges of accessory to a crime and violating his probation. He remains in the San Luis Obispo County Jail with his bail set at $75000.

Officers have identified a 52-year-old Paso Robles resident they believe was also involved in the robbery but are not yet releasing his name.

Investigators are asking anyone with information about the incident to call the Paso Robles Police Department at (805) 237-6464.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vYmdyLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvbWFzc2l2ZS1wb3dlci10b29sLXJlY2FsbC0xLTQtbWlsbGlvbi10b29scy1yZWNhbGxlZC05LXBlb3BsZS1hbHJlYWR5LWluanVyZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Massive power tool recall: 1.4 million tools recalled 9 people already injured,"It’s time to recheck your power tools following a big recall earlier this year. Two new recall actions are in place concerning devices that might cut you while you’re using them. One of them is DeWALT’s 12-inch Sliding Compound Miter Saws which sold more than 1.4 million units across the US and Canada. The other involves Makita’s cordless hedge trimmers which sold only about 2600 units in the US.

Both devices have the same problem. A part that should protect the user might lead to laceration injuries. DeWALT already received 571 malfunction reports including 9 injuries.

DeWALT’s power tool recall

DeWALT announced the 12-inch Sliding Compound Miter Saws recall this week. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) posted the announcement at this link. Similarly the Canadian recall authority published its own report — you can see it here.

The company explains the power tool features a rear safety guard that can break or detach. If that happens the user and bystanders might be exposed to projectiles. They also risk coming in contact with the power tool’s saw blade which is obviously quite dangerous.

DeWALT sold 1364000 12-inch Sliding Compound Miter Saws in the US. Moreover Canadian buyers bought an additional 118600 units.

In the US the power tool models in the recall were available at Lowe’s Home Depot and other hardware stores nationwide. Customers might have also purchased them online at Amazon Lowes and other websites.

The company sold the saws for between $600 and $820 from April 2019 through May 2022.

DeWALT says the power tool recall involves models DWS779 DWS780 and DHS790 Miter Saws. You’ll find the model numbers on the saw’s nameplate. But only the models with date codes 2019 04 through 2022 04 suffer from the problem.

The date codes appear on the black plastic motor end cap adjacent to the nameplate on the DWS779 and DWS780 models. The DHS790 model has the date code on the outside of the yellow plastic housing adjacent to the batteries. Furthermore the recall only covers saws without a green dot on the nameplate or a black dot on the arm.

Makita’s cordless hedge trimmer recall

The next power tool recall also involves an electric device made for cutting. We’re looking at Makita’s cordless hedge trimmers which also pose the risk of injury to users. The company announced the recall this week and this action is limited to the US. The CPSC report is available at this link.

Makita explains that the teal guard on the hedge trimmer’s shear blade is missing. As a result the trimmer has an increased chance of causing injury while in use.

The company sold the power tool in the recall nationwide from February 2022 through June 2022. The device cost between $260 and $460. Makita sold about 2600 units which were available at various home improvement and hardware stores. It was also sold online via Home Depot and Amazon.

Various model numbers and serial numbers are included in the recall. You’ll find the model number on the side of the trimmer. The serial number sits on the battery mounting port.

Unlike DeWALT’s power tools the Makita hedge trimmer in this recall has not yet caused any known injuries.

What you should do

If you own any of these power tools you should stop using them to avoid the risk of injury. Both recalls offer the same remedy in the form of free repairs.

DeWALT urges customers to contact the company for info on how to receive a free repair kit. Alternatively you can take the power tool to a DeWALT service center for a free repair. The company will contact all known buyers but you can also reach out.

American buyers will find contact information for DeWALT at this link. Canadians should check out the local recall announcement.

Makita also instructs customers to stop using the power tools in the recall. They should contact the company to arrange a free repair.

Makita will provide consumers with a merchandise return label so they can ship the trimmer back for repairs. Then the company will return the fixed trimmer with a teal guard on the blade. Contact information for Makita is available at this link."

A multibillion-dollar aerospace and technology company with a Tulsa facility plans to finalize the building and configuration of at least six specialized aircraft for the military here beginning this fall.

With an initial government grant of $170 million L3Harris will equip and make flight-ready at least six AT-802U Sky Warden planes in Tulsa.

The manned single-engine turboprop aircraft is designed for airborne intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance as well as missions in extreme combat environments.

It is designed to perform in austere disaggregated combat environments with limited infrastructure. It has unparalleled range and endurance weapons sensor and communication capabilities the company said.

The contract for now has a cost ceiling of $3 billion.

“I was ecstatic” Luke Savoie president of intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance for L3Harris told the Tulsa World last week when asked about news of the grant. “This is very personal to me.”

Savoie is a former Air Force pilot of the AC-130 gunship and other aircraft and had a large role in designing and developing the Sky Warden platform.

Many of the Sky Warden’s features are proprietary and its capabilities — depending on its individual specifications for the military — are not available publicly Savoie acknowledged.

However he said depending on the aircraft’s sensors a pilot would be able to pinpoint a specific point where an enemy is firing.

“I can look out the window and I can see someone shooting. And I can sit there on the throttle and hit a button and drop a point of where I was looking at. I saw someone shooting a weapon — I drop a point right there” he said.

“And I can go over here and hit another button and the auto-pilot — based on what I was just looking at — will now automatically put the aircraft into orbit around that point.

“I hit another button ... and now the fire control is targeting that position. So I have a sensor looking at it the fire control has updated that — that’s what it should be targeting — and now I can just roll in and put a shot off and engage that and never have had to sit there in tight coordinates or do all these weird mouse clicks and all this other stuff (at a distance with drone military aircraft)” Savoie said.

“It’s fairly tightly integrated and digitally controlled. And that’s the greatest thing about the weapons system is how tightly that all works.”

He declined to say the cost range for each aircraft depending on its specific weapons and sensor configuration but a news release by the company said the Sky Warden is “affordable.”

The plane’s intended use is for close combat support by the Air Force Savoie said but could also potentially be sold to U.S. allies.

“Sky Warden has a demand out there. If you’re a nation state that deals with violent extremists — if you’re either budget constrained or you’re infrastructure constrained or you need things to be multi-role ... this provides options for those potential types of customers” he said.

“I’m honored to be part of this program and provide this capability to customers. We look forward to growing ... and expanding our presence in the state and look forward to supporting the state of Oklahoma” he said.

U.S. Special Operations Command selected L3Harris and Air Tractor Inc.’s Sky Warden system for its Armed Overwatch program.

With an initial program contract award of $170 million the program could include delivery of up to 75 aircraft.

Production of new fully modified Armed Overwatch mission-configured aircraft will begin in 2023 at L3Harris’ Tulsa modification center the company said in a news release following initial production at the Air Tractor Inc.’s Olney Texas aircraft manufacturing facility.

Air Tractor is a manufacturer of aircraft for agricultural firefighting and utility applications. Olney is about 130 miles northwest of Dallas and 40 miles south of Wichita Falls.

In Tulsa since 1974 and at Tulsa International Airport since 2013 L3Harris develops maintains and operates airborne missile tracking systems in support of the Missile Defense Agency Airborne Sensor Program.

The Melbourne Florida-based company is a technology supplier for military government and commercial partners.

The discover created a nostalgic gateway into the emerging online world of 1979:

TCA launched The Source at COMDEX in June 1979. The one-time $100 subscription fee deterred all but the determined and even off-peak it was $2.75 an hour billed to the minute and rounded up (in 2022 dollars that was $391 to start and $10.75 a pop). Off-peak was defined as 6 pm to 7 am Eastern time and all day on weekends and select holidays. If you were foolish desperate or rich enough to use it during business hours it was $15 an hour (about $59 an hour today).

Dialcom used Prime minicomputers Prime being at one time the sixth largest vendor of such systems. The earliest Prime systems from 1972 were upwardly compatible with the 16-bit Honeywell Series-16 machines. Their developers had originally worked on the machines at NASA but they were 32-bit. Because of this engineering-centric background early Primes were designed to run Fortran and Prime's operating system PRIMOS (or for a time ""PR1MOS""). The transcripts here all give the system version as 2.x so the Dialcom systems in use at the time were Prime 200 machines which ran that particular version.

Dialcom's servers were located in the Washington DC area where many of its customers were also located (including a large number of US Representatives); The Source was in nearby McLean Virginia. Accessing Dialcom from DC was a matter of dialing a local number which connected you directly to the server as a terminal.

The original Spam is a brand of precooked canned meat product made by the Hormel Foods Corporation. Today there are 15 varieties of Spam sold in 41 countries and trademarked in over 100. It has transcended social classes and become an integral part of culinary cultures worldwide. So how did this canned luncheon meat product become a worldwide phenomenon? It's due in large part to American GIs and WWII.

Introduced by Hormel in 1937 Spam aimed to increase the sale of pork shoulder an unpopular cut of meat. Its name is the result of a contest won by Ken Daigneau the brother of a Hormel executive. Hormel claims that the true meaning of the Spam name ""is known by only a small circle of former Hormel Food executives"" however it is commonly accepted that it's an abbreviation of spiced ham.

During WWII delivering fresh meat to frontline troops was an extremely difficult task. Spam offered the military a canned solution that didn't require refrigeration and possessed an extremely long shelf life. As Spam became an integral part of the GI diet troops gave the meat a variety of nicknames like ""ham that didn't pass its physical"" ""meatloaf without basic training"" and ""Special Army Meat."" The grease from the luncheon meat was used to lubricate weapons and waterproof boots and the empty cans could be filled with rocks and strung from wire perimeters as intruder alarms. By the end of the war the military had purchased over 150 million pounds of Spam. For reference a can of Spam today weighs 12 ounces.

Troops across all theaters of the war brought Spam with them as a convenient and preserved meat ration. As a result of the war and the following occupations Spam was introduced to European and Asian countries where it was quickly assimilated into local diets.

In the UK Spam's popularity grew out of necessity as the result of rationing. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher remembered Spam as ""a wartime delicacy"". The canned luncheon meat has been adopted into various British recipes like Spam Yorkshire Breakfast Spamish Omelette Spam Hash and Spam Fritters.

Spam was also included as a part of Allied aid to the post-war Soviet Union. Strict food rations made meat even more scarce there than in Britain. ""Without Spam we wouldn't have been able to feed our army"" Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev declared in his memoir. East Asian countries also adopted Spam as a result of rationing and the scarcity of meat. In Hong Kong the canned meat was incorporated into local dishes like macaroni with fried egg ramen and chicken soup. Spam was ingrained so deeply in Okinawan culture that it is used in traditional onigiri (rice balls or triangles usually wrapped in seaweed) and is used in the traditional dish chanpurū. In Korea Spam's popularity rose out of the Korean War. As fish became scarce Spam was used as a replacement in kimbap (rice and vegetable seaweed rolls). The cans of luncheon meat were also used by U.S. troops to trade for goods services and even information around their bases. Today Korea is second only by the United States in Spam production and consumption.

In Southeast Asia Spam is most popular in the Philippines. Following WWII Spam became a cultural symbol on the islands. It is most commonly eaten in Spamsilog a twist on a traditional Filipino breakfast composed of rice (usually garlic fried rice) a sunny-side up egg and a meat dish. Though Spam is commonly sliced and fried it is also used in sandwiches burgers and spaghetti. In the Philippines Spam transcends social class and is extremely popular across all walks of life. There are at least 10 varieties of Spam sold in the Philippines that mimic the flavors of traditional meats. It's estimated that 1.25 million kilos of Spam is sold annually in the Philippines. After Tropical Storm Ketsana in 2009 Hormel Foods donated over 30000 pounds of Spam to the Philippine Red Cross.

In the United States Spam is especially popular in Hawaii whose residents have the highest per capita consumption in the country. Spam is used most heavily in Spam musubi where a slice is placed on top of rice and wrapped in a band of nori seaweed. The Hawaiian market also features exclusive Spam variants like Honey Spam Spam with Bacon and Hot and Spicy Spam. Spam is even served in local McDonald's and Burger King chains. Every spring Oahu hosts an annual Spam festival called Waikiki Spam Jam where local chefs and restaurants compete to make new spam-themed dishes which are then sold at the street fair.

Although it is seen by some as a food of poverty or hard times due to its affordability and long shelf life Spam's popularity around the world is undeniable. Thanks in large part to the GIs that brought it with them Spam was able to fill food gaps in countries ravaged by war and evolve into a dietary staple and cultural icon.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

The company's portfolio achieved full-year revenue per available room of $211.71 which was up 8.1% year over year. Average daily rate was $300.66 which was 1.8% above full-year 2022. Hotel occupancy was 70.4% up 6.2% from 2022.

As of publication time Host's stock was trading at $20.48 per share up 5.2% year to date. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7% for the same period.

Since then three companies have signed up to deliver something for this program: Bell with its V-280 Valor  and the coalition between Sikorsky and Boeing with their SB-1 Defiant or Defiant X.It is the Defiant we’re here to look at today or more specifically the mighty engine that will underpin it once it’s ready and if the Army decides to go for this one.You see Sikorsky and Boeing both promise the helicopter will be the “fastest assault helicopter in history” and even if in the case of rotary-wing aircraft that’s generally not that fast compared to airplanes it should break new norms.The two companies already have a prototype helicopter being put through its paces and we’ve seen plenty of it in action this past year performing anything from high-speed zig-zag maneuvers to hovering in the trees and even departing Florida for the first time for a 800-mile (1287 km) trip (with stops) to the Army Aviation Association of America’s annual summit in Nashville Tennessee.For what it’s worth we were never told what engine this prototype uses but Sikorsky and Boeing both announced that should production begin Honeywell will be the engine supplier.This company is already a huge name in the industry its engines powering a wealth of military machines. One of the most famous powerplant Honeywell makes is the T55 which spins the blades of helicopters like the CH-47 and MH-47 Chinooks.The T55 will not be used for the Defiant but a successor of it called HTS7500 . It comes with the promises of 42 percent more power than the most recent T55 but an 18 percent reduction in fuel consumption as well.Honeywell says this thing can “fly farther faster with a higher power-to-weight ratio than any comparable engine” and it does so thanks to the 7500 shaft horsepower it develops at 15000 rpm.The current Black Hawk comes with a never exceed speed of 222 mph (357 kph) but the Defiant will likely drastically improve on that. The “fastest assault helicopter in history” should be capable of reaching a cruise speed of 286 mph (460 kph) once it’s ready for duty. For now during testing conducted at the start of the year it got to 272 mph (438 kph).A great helicopter engine is not only about speed though. It also has to allow the machine it powers to lift weight and perform aggressive maneuvers. As tested until now the Defiant proved it could easily navigate 60-degree banked turns and lift up to 5300 pounds (2.4 tons) of external payload.As per the calendar announced by the Army (somewhat delayed by now) the critical design review of the selected helicopter should take place in 2024. By the turn of the decade the first new assault helicopters should start replacing the aging Black Hawk.The price of a single unit of the FLRAA helicopter is estimated at over $50 million but if we are to judge by past experience that’s probably just wishful thinking.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9tYW5oYXJ0LXJlYWR5LXRvLXVubGVhc2gtODEwLWhwLWJlbnRsZXktYmVudGF5Z2Ev0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Manhart Ready To Unleash 810-HP Bentley Bentayga,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9tYW5oYXJ0LXJlYWR5LXRvLXVubGVhc2gtODEwLWhwLWJlbnRsZXktYmVudGF5Z2Ev0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1LmNvbS9zY2ktdGVjaC90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2dhZGdldHMvaHAtcGF2aWxpb24tcGx1cy0xNC1saWdodHdlaWdodC1uby1mcmlsbHMtbGFwdG9wL2FydGljbGU2NTczNjAyMC5lY2XSAX5odHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdS5jb20vc2NpLXRlY2gvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9nYWRnZXRzL2hwLXBhdmlsaW9uLXBsdXMtMTQtbGlnaHR3ZWlnaHQtbm8tZnJpbGxzLWxhcHRvcC9hcnRpY2xlNjU3MzYwMjAuZWNlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HP Pavilion Plus 14: Lightweight no-frills laptop,"August 06 2022 03:28 pm | Updated 03:42 pm IST

HP has been one of the pioneers in laptop production and with time the brand has established itself well in the market and holds a reputation for making strong and lasting laptops. The company has come up with the latest addition to its product line by launching HP Pavilion Plus 14. The latest model is the pro version of the previously launched Pavilion 14. The new model comes with Intel Iris Graphics a 12th Generation Intel Core i5 processor. Let’s find out in detail about the new HP Pavilion Plus 14 in this review.

Design

The new HP Pavilion Plus 14 features an aluminum look and there is no major change in the look of the laptop when compared to its predecessor. The design is simple and very neat with a big HP logo on the back. The body is carved out of metal and surprisingly the metal build does not add extra weight as the laptop is very light and very easy to carry around. The bezel around the display comes with a plastic lining to protect the display from touching the keyboard. The webcam is in the center of the bezel. The ventilation bar is just below the hinge. The hinge opens to a maximum of 120-125 degrees. At the bottom on the back side lies two speaker outlets placed on the two corners. The new laptop features 2x USB-C w/ DisplayPort 1.4 + Power Delivery HDMI 2.1 USB-A 5 Gbps on the right side while on the left side one can find a 3.5 mm audio jack USB-A 5 Gbps and microSD reader.

Touchpad

The new HP Pavilion Plus 14 comes with a large click pad measuring 12.5 x 8 cm. The cursor control feels very spacious and is very smooth while using it which is mostly due to the 90 Hz refresh rate of the display. It is one of the more comfortable clicks pads as compared to any other pavilion model laptops which we have used. The clicking is very smooth which we liked while working on the laptop. The experience of using the touchpad is very satisfactory and has smooth scrolling which is a bonus when you are working on a document and need to scroll down or up quickly.

Keypad

The keyboard features the same design and looks similar to its predecessor. Working on the keyboard is very comfortable. The keyboard does not make too much sound while typing and the placements of the keys are in sync with your fingers to allow fast typing. You can locate the power button on the extreme right side of the keypad. Working late at night with lights out is also no issue as you can enable the RGB light on the keyboard to type easily.

Display

The name of the laptop in itself is explanatory of the display size which is 14 inches. The new HP Pavilion Plus 14 comes with a 2.2K resolution LED-backlit IPS display with an aspect ratio of 16:10. Working on the screen is a comfortable experience as it does not exert too much strain on the eyes and you can use it for a longer period due to the blue light emission from the screen. The color reproduction is very good and the viewing angles are very wide. The display’s brightness level is great as it has 300 nits of peak brightness and you can comfortably use the laptop to work even in the open and under natural light.

Webcam

The 5MP webcam located at the center of the display is an upgrade compared to its predecessor in terms of resolution. The camera does a good job when you need to attend make video calls or attend virtual meetings as the clarity is very good.

Processor and Performance

The new HP Pavilion Plus 14 ships with 12th Gen Intel Core i5-12500H clocked at 2.50 GHz. For the graphics the new laptop ships with Intel Iris Xe Graphics. The processor is paired with 16GB RAM to offer a better user experience and has 512 GB PCIe NVMe TLC SSD M.2 SSD storage. The laptop runs on Windows 11 Home Single Language. HP Pavilion Plus 14 handles multi-windows very comfortably and we did not come across any glitch while switching from one tab to another.

The response time is very quick when giving commands to open a new folder or jumping from one section to another on the laptop. The graphic card installed surely isn’t for heavy gaming but normal games. Throughout our time with the new HP Pavilion Plus 14 we were very much satisfied with the task handling capability. You can also use Adobe Premier Pro Adobe Photoshop Canva Google Pixel etc. for graphic designing. We did use Adobe Premier Pro and we did not come across any lag or slow speeds. The laptop ships with two asymmetric fans and two heat pipes for providing the cooling solution. The noise of the fan is very low even when the laptop was heated due to heavy gaming.

Battery

The new HP Pavilion Plus 14 comes with a 3-cell 51 Wh Li-ion polymer battery pack on board. To charge the laptop the company has provided a 90W USB Type-C power adapter capable of charging the laptop to almost 50% in 30-40 minutes. You can also charge the laptop with a Type-C power adapter of mobile phones but the charging speed will be low. While using the unit which we received we found out that the battery lasts almost 5-6 hours continuously on a single charge.

Conclusion

For the workaholics the new HP Pavilion Plus 14 possesses all the required configurations to make it work smoothly. The lightweight design makes it easy to use from any place even by holding it in one hand and typing from the other. The simple and clear design gives an aesthetic look to the laptop. The company could have used a more powerful battery to boost the longevity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tLzM1MDAtaHAtY2hldnktY2FtYXJvLXNob290cy1mb3Itcm9hZGtpbGwtbmlnaHRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch Behind The Scenes Of The 3500-HP Chevy Camaro Legend Preparing For Roadkill Nights Racing,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tLzM1MDAtaHAtY2hldnktY2FtYXJvLXNob290cy1mb3Itcm9hZGtpbGwtbmlnaHRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi0wFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzd2lyZS5jYS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2JycC10cmFuc2Zvcm1zLXRoZS1ib2F0aW5nLWV4cGVyaWVuY2Utd2l0aC1hbGwtbmV3LW1hbml0b3UtYWx1bWFjcmFmdC1hbmQtcXVpbnRyZXgtbW9kZWxzLWFuZC10aGUtZ3JvdW5kYnJlYWtpbmctcm90YXgtb3V0Ym9hcmQtZW5naW5lLXdpdGgtc3RlYWx0aC10ZWNobm9sb2d5LTgzMjAxOTMwNC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BRP TRANSFORMS THE BOATING EXPERIENCE WITH ALL-NEW MANITOU ALUMACRAFT AND QUINTREX ...,"Introducing a distinctive holistic design from bow to stern

The Rotax Outboard Engine: Hidden Quiet and Efficient

BRP completely rethought reimagined and redesigned the engine for its boats. The new Rotax Outboard Engine with Stealth Technology is initially offered in 115 and 150 hp configurations. It delivers the same advantages of a traditional outboard engine — such as price performance handling ease of maintenance and full trim — with additional benefits: it's hidden it's quiet and it's efficient.

Partially submerged underwater hidden under the boat the engine is smooth and quiet at any speed. It doesn't block the way at the stern and therefore frees up valuable space. The Rotax Outboard Engine is also efficient allowing for up to 20% improved fuel efficiency compared to traditional outboard engines. What's more it is the cleanest combustion outboard engine in its class  with a 12% reduction in reportable emissions and a 98% reduction in carbon monoxide at idle compared to leading outboard engine brands[1].

The new Manitou pontoons and Alumacraft and Quintrex boats have been crafted for an optimal integration of the new Rotax Outboard Engine with Stealth Technology for an unrivalled experience that will wow boaters and their families. Competitively priced within their segments these new model year 2023 lineups offer incredible value and will be irresistible to any consumer in the market for a boat.

Manitou : Revolutionizing the Pontoon Experience

The new Manitou Cruise (20' 22' and 24') and Explore models (22' 24' and 26') break away from the sea of sameness that has defined the pontoon segment for decades. The innovative design features a bold modernized easy to maintain exterior thanks to an aluminum transformation process traditionally only used in the luxury automotive industry. The exterior bow area is also very distinctive with its new Manitou lighting signature encompassing the navigation lights and providing even more character. The forward-leaning Sport Bimini puts the final touch to create an elevated visual appearance.

The unique interior is also second to none. The helm area has been completely redesigned with ergo-specialists and design experts to convey functionality simplicity and modernity. The sleek new MAX Deck platform that simply doesn't exist on any other pontoon unlocks 38 square feet of additional usable space meaning more comfort and more possibilities for recreation at the stern. With flexible layout selections and seating configurations and a class-leading helm and dash including a Garmin digital dashboard and a Fusion stereo as standard options captains will take control for the perfect day on the water.

As a roller-coaster of musical styles set the beat to the usual frenetic tone for P.J. Fleck's high-octane practices the coach used his wireless microphone throughout to encourage correct and cajole his players who were wrapping up the first week of camp. The ""pig pen'' and ""axe tough'' intense sessions were back complete with the sounds of hogs squealing and chain saws running lest the Gophers forget the identity of their most bitter rivals Iowa and Wisconsin.

And when Fleck silenced the cacophony to emphasize a point such as when are the only times to stretch out a ball for extra yardage his players had the answer. ""You only reach the ball on fourth-and-1 fourth-and-goal and a two-point conversion'' wide receiver Chris Autman-Bell said.

Saturday's session was the first time media members could see the Gophers in training camp ahead of their Sept. 1 opener vs. New Mexico State and a handful of items stood out.

Ibrahim and Potts look sharp: Running backs Mohamed Ibrahim (Achilles' tendon) missed all but one game last season while versatile backup Trey Potts (undisclosed injury) missed the final eight. Both were impressive Saturday running hard and taking contact during the first day of full pads in training camp. Both also wore padded helmet caps for extra protection.

""They're just happy to be on the field and they never take a day for granted'' Fleck said. ""… To see what they've been through and then see it on the field and see the smile on their faces that's refreshing.''

Wright impresses again: Autman-Bell has been the Gophers top receiver over the past two seasons and through the small sample size of spring practice and training camp sophomore Dylan Wright could develop into a second go-to wideout. At a lean and explosive 6-3 and 210 pounds Wright certainly looks the part and Saturday the Texas A&M transfer made a spectacular sideline grab on an out pattern.

""There's going to be plays that you're going to miss out on but he is there he's not beat himself up'' quarterback Tanner Morgan said. ""He's responding. He's going to work. And it's been awesome to see his growth.''

It was T-Time's time: Fifth-year senior defensive back Terell Smith was a highlight machine Saturday breaking up at least four passes during team drills. On one long sideline route Smith knocked the ball away from Autman-Bell just before the receiver could catch the pass. ""T-Time shout out to him'' Autman-Bell said with a laugh.

Battle is on at RT: Four-fifths of the Gophers offensive line appears to be penciled in with Aireontae Ersery at left tackle Axel Ruschmeyer at left guard John Michael Schmitz at center and Michigan transfer Chuck Filiaga at right guard.

Right tackle is up for grabs with Martes Lewis JJ Guedet and Notre Dame transfer Quinn Carroll vying for the job. ""It's competitive'' Fleck said ""really competitive.''

Overall Fleck likes the work he has seen so far.

""When you've got a really committed team you can raise the bar and they come up to it every time'' he said. ""And that's what they've done for six straight days.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlYWNvbmpvdXJuYWwuY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvcHdvbzAyNzExNzDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Claire Rastetter Obituary,"Let the family know you are thinking of them

HII,Huntington Ingalls Industries,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvNTQ1NjYtYmVjaHRlbC0zYi1jb250cmFjdC1hd2FyZC1hdC1kb2Utc2l0ZS1oYWx0ZWQtYnktdHdvLWJpZC1wcm90ZXN0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bechtel $3B Contract Award at DOE Site Halted by Two Bid Protests,"Two bid protests are likely to delay the U.S. Dept. of Energy's final award of a multi-year management contract worth up to $3 billion to a Bechtel-led team to manage construction and operation of the country's key underground nuclear waste disposal site the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico sources tell ENR.

DOE announced the cost-plus-award-fee contract July 11 to Tularosa Basin Range Services a Bechtel single-purpose subsidiary for a four-year term with six one-year extension options. The contractor team also includes Los Alamos Technical Associates as a small business subcontractor was selected as “best value to the government” the agency said.

WIPP the world's first underground repository for permanent disposal of transuranic radioactive waste has operated since 1999 at a site 26 miles east of Carlsbad N.M.

DOE said there were five bidders for the contract but has declined to disclose their names or the identities of team members.

If finalized the Bechtel team would succeed Nuclear Waste Partnership a joint venture between contractors Amentum and BWXT that has managed WIPP operations since 2012. Its contract was set to expire on Sept. 30 with a DOE site spokesman saying previously that the transition would occur before the end of the year. An Amentum spokesman previously said Nuclear Waste Partnership would not rebid.

But the bid protests by two unsuccessful bidders within the last two weeks could push that into next year. A DOE spokesman in Washington D.C. confirmed the protest filings to the U.S. Government Accountability Office but would not comment further on whether Nuclear Waste Partnership’s contract would be extended or related to other transition schedule changes “until the protests are resolved.”

The two filings give GAO until Nov. 9 to rule on the protests so it is not clear what steps DOE will take in the interim. Agency officials have said at community forums that the WIPP workforce would not be affected according to local reports.

One industry source close to the competition who declined to be identified says “the protests will almost certainly delay the transition. GAO has 100 days to rule on the protests which puts us into November. It would be remarkable if GAO did not take the full time allotted.”

He says the contract of the incumbent Amentum-BWXT team “will very likely be extended” possibly for up to one year but “with the caveat that [DOE] can terminate early for any reason” such as if protests are resolved quickly. But the source says DOE would not likely “announce or confirm any extension until very close to when the current contract expires.”

The award schedule also hinges on whether the GAO decision requires “corrective actions” the source says and how DOE responds. The agency “won’t set a transition start date until all of that is resolved” with year-end holidays posing an added complication he adds.

No Details From Protesters

A GAO spokesman confirmed the latest protest from bidder Carlsbad Operations Alliance LLC on Aug. 1 challenging the Bechtel selection. Sources knowledgable about the bid say Westinghouse leads the team with Veolia Nuclear Services Solutions a team partner. Company spokespersons declined comment on the protest or the competition.

Also protesting is bidder National TRU Solutions which sources and media reports say is a joint venture led by Newport News Va.-based Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII). Other partners could include Atkins or BWX Technologies sources told Weapons Complex Monitor. An HII subsidiary and BWXT are teamed as the contractor managing cleanup at DOE's Los Alamos National Laboratory site also in New Mexico about 350 miles from WIPP.

An HII spokesperson for the firm’s nuclear work did not respond to ENR queries on its contract bid or reasons for the protest.

The protests are not “public documents” the GAO spokesman says noting that they contain a “contractor’s proprietary business information related to the procurement [and] source selection information.” He adds that GAO “has issued a protective order ... to prevent the disclosure.”

If the award proceeds Bechtel would manage WIPP projects that include building a new ventilation system at the transuranic waste repository buried in a salt deposit about 2150 ft underground.

Work on the system began in 2018 after two radiological leaks at the site in 2014 halted site operations for about three years and keeps them currently limited. The releases were linked to a mispackaged waste container sent from the Los Alamos site that ruptured causing site contamination and elevated radiation levels in the nearby environment. Bechtel was part of the team managing Los Alamos operations until 2018.

The new ventilation system is intended to boost airflow by about 270% at the WIPP site to enable full operation to resume including work to expand capacity.

A GAO report issued in March however noted the ventilation project that was set to finish in November at a total cost of $288 million was revised by DOE last year to cost about $486 million with completion pushed back to January 2026. GAO also noted that a new utility shaft being built at the site to complement the system is also facing cost overruns and schedule delays.

The report cited site contractor Nuclear Waste Partnership's ""inexperience managing construction projects"" among other reasons for the project completion issues which also include workforce staffing gaps and impacts from COVID-19. GAO specified the need for a required DOE “corrective plan” to look at ""root causes"" of the project cost and schedule problems to which the agency concurred in its response.

GAO also noted the pressing need for site disposal expansion citing ""a large amount of transuranic waste at sites around the country"" and concern ""whether the new space will be ready in time to prevent an interruption of disposal operations."" About 22 DOE nuclear sites ship waste to WIPP.

Bechtel noted its 44 years of experience in work at DOE sites in New Mexico Washington Idaho Nevada Texas Kentucky Tennessee and South Carolina. The firm remains site management contractor at the DOE Pantex site near Amarillo Texas and the Y-12 National Security complex in Oak Ridge Tenn. following the agency's June decision to extend its contract after bid protests resulted in cancellation of an award to a Fluor Corp.-led team and rebid of a revised contract. Bechtel also has been building a waste treatment complex at DOE's massive Hanford site in Washington for nearly two decades a project nearing the first stage of completion on facilities to immobilize low-level waste and prepare it for secure onsite disposal.",,,,,,,,,,,,

His predecessor Paul Cormier stepped down to move into the chairman role.

It’s never easy making a transition like this but Hicks has Cormier his longtime mentor to lean on as he takes the Red Hat reins. In his new role Hicks has to walk the line between reassuring customers and employees that there will be stability in the company’s leadership while moving it forward and putting his own mark on things.

For the most part Hicks said he will continue on the same path as Cormier. IBM has allowed Red Hat to be independent for the most part since purchasing it for $34 billion in 2018. IBM sells Red Hat services to take advantage of its sales clout but Red Hat has remained independent with many partners besides IBM.

As Cormier told me about his relationship with IBM CEO Arvind Krishna in a May interview: “The way Arvind characterizes Red Hat is that IBM will be opinionated on Red Hat but it can’t work the other way around. So what that means is IBM has completely standardized on Red Hat as the [company’s] hybrid platform” Cormier said.

Under Cormier Red Hat helped IBM return to growth after a long period of stagnation. Big Blue’s revenue was up 9% in its most recent earnings report last month. Red Hat grew 12% and has been a big contributor to IBM’s growth strategy

It’s up to Hicks to keep that going while taking Red Hat wherever it’s going to go next. I spoke to him recently about the transition to his new role and what it means for all parties involved from customers and employees to parent company IBM.

Moving on up

Hicks worked his way up through the company in his 16 years culminating in this promotion to CEO.

“I’ve really progressed up through Red Hat from the IT side and engineering” he said. “I was involved in the foundational days of what we now know as OpenShift. And I’ve just loved every aspect of how Red Hat works and that we focus on the open source model. I think that it has always been a model I’ve been drawn to of how open source development works and the opportunity they’ve associated with that.”

He recognizes the responsibility of being next in line. “I’m really excited about the opportunity just to be able to guide Red Hat to that next phase. I’ve worked with Paul and Jim [Whitehurst] prior to that for a long time. So you know it’s a humbling opportunity for me and it’s something that at its core I really love.”

He also pointed out that Cormier is still around just in a different role. “So the first thing in Paul’s role as chairman he’ll still be actively tied in on our strategy. Paul has phenomenal intuition both for Red Hat and I think the industry. He’s still going to be running our strategic advisory board. He’s still going to be working with customers and we both share a passion for the opportunity around open hybrid cloud” he said.

Cormier told me in that May interview that IBM maintains a hands-off approach to Red Hat when it comes to strategy. “We still run our own strategy. We run where we’re going to go and we never ever ever get pushback from IBM on that” he said.

Hicks said he will stick with that approach. “What does this [change] mean for the strategy of the company? It’s really nice to authentically say that the strategy doesn’t change. … Nothing you have bet on when you invested in us whether it’s with your career or your dollars changes [with this leadership change]” he told me.

Putting his mark on things

Holger Mueller an analyst at Constellation Research said that promoting Hicks was a big move and he sees a shift coming involving a focus on more products. “Hicks is even more product-centric [than Cormier was] and what customers and IBM need from Red Hat is more product than ever. Over time Red Hat should focus on more R&D and product focus will be important for all involved — Red Hat IBM and of course customers” Mueller told TechCrunch.

Hicks said the current approach was defined by Cormier and he doesn’t want to alter that too much as he takes over.

“I believe in this strategy to be honest” he said. “I’ve worked hand in hand with Paul helping to formulate and implement that strategy. So that’s one of the questions we get asked a lot and we fall back to I think [the notion of the] open hybrid cloud as the growth engine for the company. It’s the opportunity.”

But as he looks ahead he also sees new opportunities in edge computing. “The first area that we would definitely say is changing and growing quickly is just in the opportunity with hybrid cloud extending to the edge” he said.

“When we say edge this is really focused on what are these enterprise-critical workloads that run outside of the data center … with a tremendous increase in the number of applications built there” he added. For starters the company is looking at industries with big edge cases like telcos and automotive especially as cars become increasingly connected.

Hicks acknowledged that his leadership style is a bit different from Cormier’s.

“Our styles differ a bit and we probably both come a little more together in the middle where Paul has always had this core passion and I would say you always knew where you stood with Paul. He might be on the blunt side. But he brings engaged energy and drive. I loved that and it was inspiring to me. … I can be more on the patient side and diligent in the details and working through them” he said. And after working with Cormier all these years Hicks said their styles have merged a bit over time.

Hicks is still getting his feet wet as he takes over a role he’s been working toward his entire career. “It’s a little stunning to me still to get the CEO opportunity but I’ve had just a really nice progression over 16 years to get that opportunity to how we run the business experience in every aspect of how we do it. So I’m looking forward to it.”

In 1965 Herbert Simon a Nobel laureate in economics and also a winner of the Turing Award (considered “The Nobel Prize of computing”) predicted that “machines will be capable within 20 years of doing any work a man can do.” His misplaced faith in computers is hardly unique. Sixty-seven years later we are still waiting for computers to become our slaves and masters.

Businesses have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on AI moonshots that have crashed and burned. IBM’s “Dr. Watson” was supposed to revolutionize health care and “eradicate cancer.” Eight years later after burning through $15 billion with no demonstrable successes IBM fired Dr. Watson.

In 2016 Turing Award Winner Geoffrey Hinton advised that “We should stop training radiologists now. It’s just completely obvious that within five years deep learning is going to do better than radiologists.” Six years later the number of radiologists has gone up not down. Researchers have spent billions of dollars working on thousands of radiology image-recognition algorithms that are not as good as human radiologists.

What about those self-driving vehicles promised by many including Elon Musk in his 2016 boast that “I really consider autonomous driving a solved problem. I think we are probably less than two years away.” Six years later the most advanced self-driving vehicles are arguably Waymos in San Francisco which only operate between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. on the least crowded roads and still have accidents and cause traffic tie-ups. They are a long way from successfully operating in downtown traffic during the middle of the day at a required 99.9999% level of proficiency.

The list goes on. Zillow’s house-flipping misadventure lost billions of dollars trying to revolutionize home-buying before they shuttered it. Carvana’s car-flipping gambit still loses billions.

We have argued for years that we should be developing AI that makes people more productive instead of trying to replace people. Computers have wondrous memories make calculations that are lightning-fast and error-free and are tireless but humans have the real-world experience common sense wisdom and critical thinking skills that computers lack. Together they can do more than either could do on their own.

Effective augmentation appears to be finally happening with medical images. A large-scale study just published in Lancet Digital Health is the first to directly compare AI cancer screening when used alone or to assist humans. The software comes from a German startup Vara whose AI is already used in more than 25% of Germany’s breast cancer screening centers.

Researchers from Vara Essen University and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center trained the algorithm on more than 367000 mammograms and then tested it on 82851 mammograms that had been held back for that purpose.

In the first strategy the algorithm was used alone to analyze the 82851 mammograms. In the second strategy the algorithm separated the mammograms into three groups: clearly cancer clearly no cancer and uncertain. The uncertain mammograms were then sent to board-certified radiologists who were given no information about the AI diagnosis.

Doctors and AI working together turned out to be better than either working alone. The AI pre-screening reduced the number of images the doctors examined by 37% while lowering the false-positive and false-negative rates by about a third compared to AI alone and by 14%-20% compared to doctors alone. Less work and better results!

As machine learning improves the AI analysis of X-rays will no doubt become more efficient and accurate. There will come a time when AI can be trusted to work alone. However that time is likely to be decades in the future and attempts to jump directly to that point are dangerous.

We are optimistic that the productivity of many workers can be improved by similar augmentation strategies — not to mention the fact that many of the tasks that computers excel at are dreadful drudgery; e.g. legal research inventory control and statistical calculations. But far too many attempts to replace humans entirely have not only been an enormous waste of resources but have also undermined the credibility of AI research. The last thing we need is another AI winter where funding dries up resources are diverted and the tremendous potential of these technologies are put on hold. We are optimistic that the accumulating failures of moonshots and successes of augmentation strategies will change the way that we think about AI.

The survey is necessary to ascertain whether there was any manipulation in the extraction of iron ore.In a letter to the SIT IBM said the bureau’s Nagpur headquarters wants to ascertain the total work required to conduct the survey.The SIT had written to the IBM asking it to conduct the detailed survey to ascertain whether there was actual iron ore extraction from them between 2007 and2012 and to find the approximate loss to the state exchequer.A senior official said that it has been nearly three months but there is no progress on the issue.The SIT’s letter to the IBM said that the survey it requested is “necessary for the purpose of investigation”.Police said that during the investigation it came to light that 59 mining leases were operational between 2007 to 2012 and that the SIT wants to know whether there was really extraction from those leases or some manipulation.The SIT completed a preliminary report of over 50% of the mining leases. In all it is probing alleged violations in 126 mining leases.The report consists of verification of documents of mining leases whom the leases were allotted to and who was operating them and whether valid environment clearances were obtained. Based on this report a final decision pertaining to the investigation will be taken by the SIT.The SIT had filed 16 first information reports (FIRs) in the illegal mining cases of which eight have been chargesheeted three have been closed and three others transferred to the police stations concerned. Three other cases have been quashed by the court a senior police officer said.Incidentally not much progress has been made in the investigation despite the SIT having probed the case for over six-and-a-half years now.On July 26 2013 the mines department had filed a criminal complaint with the crime branch seeking that criminal liability be fixed against those involved in the mining scam.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L2RhdGEtc2NpZW5jZS90b3AtMTAtZGF0YS1zY2llbmNlLWNvdXJzZXMtd2l0aC1saXZlLXByb2plY3RzLXRvLWF0dGVuZC1pbi0yMDIy0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW5hbHl0aWNzaW5zaWdodC5uZXQvYW1wL3N0b3J5L2RhdGEtc2NpZW5jZS90b3AtMTAtZGF0YS1zY2llbmNlLWNvdXJzZXMtd2l0aC1saXZlLXByb2plY3RzLXRvLWF0dGVuZC1pbi0yMDIy?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 10 Data Science Courses with Live Projects to Attend in 2022,Udemy provides knowledgeable and hands-on projects for data scientists to have a deeper understanding of data management projects.

All experiments were performed according to the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals in China. The sampled fish in this study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the College of Animal Science and Technology of Sichuan Agricultural University Sichuan China under permit No. DKY-YS13287.

Sequencing libraries

Tissues from a two-year-old adult female largemouth bass (body weight 1487 g length 36 cm) obtained from an aquaculture farm of Chongzhou Sichuan province China were used to construct genomic DNA sequencing libraries (muscle) and transcriptome sequencing libraries (liver brain muscle heart kidney gill and gonad). All the tissues were stored in liquid nitrogen until use.

For short-read sequencing genomic DNA was extracted from 500 mg of muscle using cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) before chloroform purification. The genomic DNA was sonicated to a fragment size of 350 bp and the paired-end genomic library was prepared following the Illumina standard protocol including terminal repair polyA and adaptor addition target fragment selection and PCR processes (Illumina San Diego CA USA). The resulted library was quality checked using Agilent Bioanalyser 2100 and qPCR and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform with paired-end 150 bp read layout.

For long-read sequencing genomic DNA (~8 µg) was sheared into a large fragment by g-TUBE (Covaris) purified and recovered by AMpure PB magnetic beads and used to construct single-molecule real-time bell (SMRTbell) sequencing libraries by the SMRTbell Template Prep Kit 2.0 (PacBio)28. The end-repaired fragments were size-selected using the Blue Pippin Size-Selection System (Sage Science MA USA) and damage-repaired using the SMRTbell Damage Repair Kit (PacBio). Then the products were combined polymerase using the PacBio DNA/Polymerase Kit before sequenced on the PacBio Sequel platform.

The full-length transcriptome was used to generate RNA data for gene prediction from a sample pool consisting of muscle liver gonad kidney gut blood and gills. Total RNA was extracted by TRIzol extraction reagent (Invitrogen USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA purity was checked using the NanoPhotometer spectrophotometer (IMPLEN CA USA). RNA concentration was measured using Qubit RNA Assay Kit in Qubit 2.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies CA USA). Then these tissues RNA were equally mixed to product cDNA using the SMARTer PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit and sequencing by one SMRT flow cell on the PacBio Sequel platform. Raw reads were processed into error corrected reads of insert (ROIs) using Iso-seq pipeline with minFullPass = 0 and minPredictedAccuracy = 0.90. Next full-length non-chemiric (FLNC) transcripts were determined by searching for the polyA tail signal and the 5′ and 3′ cDNA primers in ROIs. Full-length consensus sequences obtained from ICE (Iterative Clustering for Error Correction) were polished using Quiver. Finally Full-length transcriptome sequencing yielded 20 Gb of clean data including 26369 high-quality consensus isoforms sequences with an average length of 2895 bp.

Genome survey and assembly

The size heterozygosity and repetitive sequences in the M. salmoides genome were estimated by the analysis of k-mer frequency distribution of Illumina paired-end reads using the kmer_freq_stat script (Biomarker Technologies Beijing China) based on the formula G = (N k-mer - Nerror_k-mer)/D (where G: genome size; N k-mer: the number of k-mers; Nerror_k-mer: the number of depth 1 k-mers; D: the k-mer depth). After removing the k-mers with abnormal depth a total of 49.16 M k-mers were obtained with a k-mers peak at a depth of 56 (Fig. 2). A total of 58.51 Gb high-quality filtered data was generated from the Illumina short read DNA library with 66.94 × genome coverage a Q20 of 96.63% and a Q30 of 91.36% (Table 1). The genome size was estimated at 874.14 Mb with 0.12% heterozygosity 30.03% repetitive sequences and 40.88% GC content (Table 1).

Fig. 2 K‐mer distribution of M. salmoides genome sequencing reads. The K-mers distribution (K = 19) was constructed using 350 bp library data. A total of 49157214151 K-mers were used for genomic length estimation after the removal of the K-mers with abnormal depth. The peak 19‐mer depth was 56 and the genome size was calculated as 49157214151/56 = 874.14 Mb. Full size image

For long-read sequencing reads longer than 500 bp generated by the PacBio Sequel platform were collected and a de novo genome was assembled initially using SMARTdenovo29 based on the data corrected by Canu v. 1.530. Subsequently three rounds of refinement of the de novo genome were performed using Pilon31 by Illumina short read sequencing data. Finally the long-read SMRTbell library generated a total of 94.69 Gb (112.07 × genome coverage) with a reads N50 of 35.34 kb and an average read length of 24.75 kb. After error correction and assembly an 844.88 Mb genome was assembled from 265 contigs with a N50 of 15.68 Mb (Table 1).

Hi-C analysis and chromosome assembly

Hi-C libraries were prepared as previously reported3233. Briefly muscle tissue cells were fixed with formaldehyde to maintain the 3D structure of DNA in cells and the cells were digested using restriction endonuclease Hind III. Then biotin-labeled bases were introduced using the DNA terminal repair mechanism. DNA (4 µg) was fragmented by a Covaris S220 focused-ultrasonicator (Gene Company Limited Hong Kong) and 300–700 bp fragments were recovered. The DNA fragments containing interaction relationships were captured by streptavidin immunomagnetic beads for library construction. Library concentration and insert size were determined using the Qubit 3.0 and LabChip GX platforms (PerkinElmer) respectively. qPCR was used to estimate the effective concentration of the library. High quality Hi-C libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform and the sequencing data were used for chromosome-level assembly34. The software Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA-MEM v. 0.7.10-r789) was used to align the sequencing pair-end clean reads with the sequence of the assembled genome to obtain the uniquely mapped read pairs35. The uniquely mapped read pairs were processed using HiC-Pro36. The genome contigs split into 50 kb segments combined with uniquely matched Hi-C data were clustered ordered and directed onto the pseudochromosomes using LACHESIS34 with the following parameters: CLUSTER_MIN_RE_SITES = 30; CLUSTER_MAX_LINK_DENSITY = 2; CLUSTER_NONINFORMATIVE_RATIO = 2; ORDER_MIN_N_RES_IN_TRUN = 68; ORD-ER_MIN_N_RES_I-N_SHREDS = 67. Finally the chromosome assemblies were cut into 100 kb bins of equal lengths and the interaction signals generated by the valid mapped read pairs between each bin were visualized in a heat map.

In total 277.88 million read pairs (77.53 Gb clean data; 94.06 × coverage of the genome) were generated from the Hi-C library (Table 1) of which 77.26% were uniquely mapped on the assembled genome. Of the unique mapped read pairs 60.67% were the valid interaction pairs (130.26 million) which were used for the next Hi-C assembly (Table S1). A total of 844.00 Mb (99.9%) assembled genome sequences were anchored on 23 chromosomes and the order and direction of 827.39 Mb (98.03%) sequences could be determined. The detailed distribution of each chromosome sequence was shown in Table 2. The heat map of the Hi-C assembly interaction bins is consistent a genome assembly of excellent quality (Fig. 3). Finally the genome size of M. salmoides was assembled at 844.88 Mb while contig N50 and scaffold N50 were 15.30 Mb and 35.77 Mb respectively (Table 1).

Repeats prediction

The repetitive elements of the M. salmoides genome were identified and annotated using RepeatModeler2 containing RECON37 and RepeatScout38. The derived repetitive sequences were searched against curated libraries and the repetitive DNA element databases Repbase39 REXdb40 and Dfam41. The LTR retrotransposon retriever42 was applied to identify the output from LTRharvest43 and LTR_FINDER44. The results were combined and deduplicated and the repetitive elements were finalized by RepeatMasker45. About 38.19% M. salmoides genome was repetitive sequences composed mainly of class II transposable elements (Table 3).

Table 3 The repeat sequence statistics of assembled genome. Full size table

Genes prediction and annotation

The prediction of the genome gene structure was based on three different strategies: ab initio-based homolog-based and unigene-based. Genscan46 Augustus v2.447 GlimmerHMM v3.0.448 GeneID v1.449 and SNAP (version 2006-07-28)50 were used to perform ab initio-based prediction. GeMoMa v1.3.15152 was used for prediction based on homologous species. Hisat v2.0.453 and Stringtie v1.2.354 were used for assembly based on reference transcripts and TransDecoder v2.0 and GeneMarkS -t v5.155 were used for gene prediction. PASA v2.0.256 was used to predict unigene sequences based on unreferenced assembly of full-length transcriptome data. Finally EVM v1.1.157 was used to integrate the prediction results obtained by the above three methods and PASA v2.0.2 was used to modify the final gene models. A total of 26370 protein-coding genes were predicted by integrating the prediction of ab initio homology-based and RNA-seq strategies (Table S2) with average gene length of 14483 bp exon length of 2601 bp coding sequence of 1724 bp and intron length of 11882 bp (Table 4). Finally 25760 genes (97.69% of the total) were successfully annotated GO KEGG KOG TrEMBL and NR database (Table S3).

Table 4 The basic information statistics of assembled genome. Full size table

Blastn searches using the Rfam database58 as input against the M. salmoides genome was used to identify microRNA and rRNA and tRNAscan-SE59 was used to identify tRNA. Non-coding RNAs were predicted to be 2639 including 633 microRNAs (miRNA) of 84 families 230 rRNA genes of 4 families and 1830 tRNA genes of 25 families (Table S4). Pseudogenes were predicted in the following way. The predicted protein sequences were used to search for homologous gene sequences (putative genes) through BLAT alignment60. Then GeneWise61 was used to search for immature termination codons and code-shifting mutations in the gene sequences to obtain pseudogenes. In total 986 pseudogenes were identified with a total length of 5885501 bp and an average length of 5969 bp (Table S4).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hbmFseXplLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4L2F2b2lkaW5nLXBlcnNvbmFsaXMtc3RvY2stcHNubC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why We No Longer Like Personalis Stock,"As our tech investing methodology evolves new rules help us better avoid risks and pitfalls by choosing companies that have proven their potential.

We’ve been using HART Impact Sockets and we are impressed so got our hands on the HART 275-piece mechanics tool set to see how they’re doing with other automotive-focused hand tools. At first glance this set is pretty daunting so we’ll break it down piece by piece so you can decide if it’s the right set for you.

Hands-On With The HART 275-Piece Mechanics Tool Set

Ratchets

Right off the bat I noticed the three ratchets in the set have a quality look and feel. The 1/4-inch 3/8-inch and 1/2-inch drive sizes all have a 90-tooth design giving you a compact 4° swing arc. Plus the contoured head shape allows you to work in tighter spaces.

One of my favorite features is the push-button socket release on the back of the ratchet head which keeps sockets securely in place while making removal a breeze.

Wrenches

This kit comes with a standard set of combination wrenches. You get metric sizes ranging from 8 to 15 mm and SAE sizes from 1/4-inch to 5/8-inch.

Sockets and Accessories

The HART 275-piece mechanics tool set contains a standard variety of sockets and drivers but there are a few noteworthy inclusions that set it apart from basic kits.

This set includes a combination of metric and SAE shallow and deep sockets in both 1/4-inch and 3/8-inch drives. It includes 12-point shallow sockets for the 1/2-inch drive size.

HART went the extra mile and added SAE and metric shallow impact-rated sockets ranging in size from 3/8-inch to 1 inch and 10mm to 23mm respectively.

More Tools!

Some honorable mentions in this mechanics set include a 1/4-inch magnetic bit driver 48 driver bits and both SAE and metric nut drivers. HART also includes a full set of SAE and metric hex keys hex drivers Torx drivers and drive size adapters.

Storing The HART 275-Piece Mechanics Tool Set

You gotta have a place to store all of these tools and accessories and HART organizes them in a sturdy blow-molded tool box with no wasted space. The underside of the lid houses the deep well sockets and the top tray holds your chrome 6-point shallow sockets some accessories. Its three removable trays hold the rest of the sockets wrenches and accessories and can be arranged in whatever order is most convenient for you.

Two folding side doors snap in place to keep the trays from unintentionally sliding out during transport.

In addition to these doors we LOVE that HART chose to use metal latches instead of plastic which is more likely to break or pop off over time. Two nylon straps are riveted to the lid and keep it from over-extending and damaging the hinges.

Carrying the box is easy by using either the two side handles or its stout rubber overmolded top handle. With so many tools in the box it’s heavy and those side handles are really helpful. Plan to use those side handles if your hands are on the bigger side to avoid your fingers getting pinched on the lid.

This comes from YouTuber Moore’s Law is Dead (MLID) who claims that AMD will actually have next-gen Zen 4 CPUs ready to be sent to reviewers on August 10. Take some large helpings of seasoning with that of course but the point here is that the processors are ready to go out for folks to start playing with and testing next week.

So prepare yourself for a lot more info and leakage on how Ryzen 7000 chips are shaping up in the very near future. But more to the point this suggests that AMD could actually launch Zen 4 silicon this month if the company really wanted to at least in a more limited fashion.

But the plan MLID asserts is to run production for a while and have a “very big high-volume launch” of the entire initial line-up in September. (Those first CPUs out the gate are rumored to be the Ryzen 7950X 7900X 7700X and 7600X.)

This is doubly important because MLID reckons that Intel is struggling to push out Raptor Lake on time for its theoretically intended debut in October. Indeed the leaker suggests that this may be more of a paper launch for Intel’s 13th-gen processors so those chips may not arrive in larger quantities until later in the year.

What this could mean is AMD has the shelves full of Ryzen 7000 processors and all the key high-end to mid-range chips in the middle of September and those products will be going up against current-gen Intel Alder Lake CPUs. Because Raptor Lake may not pitch up in quantity until several months afterwards as even if Intel does launch in October this won’t be a case of plentiful 13th-gen stock flowing right out of the gate.

In short the rumor is that Team Red will have quite a big head-start on Team Blue; bigger than we thought because for a while now it’s been common speculation that AMD is going to beat Intel to the punch for release timeframes in the next-gen CPU wars.

If MLID is correct of course which is a sizeable if – but the leaker seems pretty confident that AMD is in a good place for shaping up to a big launch. So much so that the company could even bring things forward for a start of September launch for Ryzen 7000 rather than the middle of the month. (Although we suspect even if this was possible Team Red could still want to leave a bit more time to sell more Ryzen 5000 stock through anyway before Zen 4 appears.)

When Raptor Lake does arrive in force the battle of the next-gen processors is likely to be a very closely fought one at least in terms of raw performance. AMD may however score wins in other metrics like power efficiency and the newness of the platform – Zen 4 is on AM5 a new socket and motherboard which will be good for future upgrades. Whereas Raptor Lake will be the last generation to use the current (Alder Lake) socket for Intel so that means no possibility of further upgrading to a newer generation Intel CPU in those PCs without changing the motherboard too.

Pricing will of course be a key factor and we have no clue how that will turn out yet. Is there a prospect that with Raptor Lake theoretically coming a fair bit later than Ryzen 7000 Intel will have to price competitively to get back in the game so to speak? That’s pure speculation and given past history it seems unlikely anyway but we shall see.

One thing’s certain namely that this will be a fascinating battle of new generations with AMD currently looking like it’s in a good position to regain some serious ground in terms of desktop CPU turf after Intel has had considerable success with Alder Lake this year.

Don’t forget that AMD also has 3D V-cache versions of Ryzen 7000 to come and MLID also reckons that these could arrive sooner than you might think – likely in the first half of 2023. If it’s early next year then that could be another major factor for Intel to worry about as 3D V-cache spins on Zen 4 CPUs are going to be quite something for gamers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9tc2lzLWZpcnN0LWludGVsLWdyYXBoaWNzLWNhcmQtaXMtYS1sb3ctcHJvZmlsZS1hcmMtYTM4MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MSI's First Intel Graphics Card Is a Low-Profile Arc A380,"An MSI branded Intel Arc A380 graphics card has emerged online. It is the first example from one of the big three AIBs. Thus it is a significant find even though the card is not available as a separate retail product only as a component in pre-built MSI systems.

MSI’s first Intel graphics card in the shape of the Arc A380 graphics card is a low profile or LP model. It seems an appropriate choice for its 75W design. We looked at previous MSI LP designs with Nvidia and AMD GPUs and while many also use two small fans the cooling shroud design is new for Intel Arc. It is pleasantly sculpted but minimal and we wonder if Intel had a hand in the design.

MSI is the first AIB to ship an Arc A380 with reference GPU and memory clocks. It probably helped it stick to the 75W TDP and may mean that it is entirely bus powered (it won’t need an extra power connector from your PSU). If this is so but MSI’s specs don’t confirm it then it could be a good choice for those upgrading PCs without any spare power connectors available. Previous A380 designs from Gunnir and ASRock need a supplementary 8-pin power connector.

(Image credit: MSI / JD)

We expect the MSI Arc A380 LP to perform slower than the OC examples from rivals. For instance its GPU operates 20% slower than the Gunnir and 10% slower than the ASRock models we have seen.

The MSI desktop systems are packing Arc A380 GPUs unearthed by VideoCardz and retail at Chinese electronics retailer JD.com. The most powerful and modern option available uses an Intel Core i5-12400F CPU with the aforementioned Arc A380 and poses as a machine for eSports titles or internet café-style gaming. However there are other CPU choices such as the Core i3-10105F or i5-10400F for those with smaller budgets or more modest needs. All the systems feature MSI Bomber motherboards (H510M or H610M depending on processor generation). Pricing of these systems ranges from the local equivalent of $530 to $650.

There have also been recent rumors that at least one major AIB has halted production of Arc graphics cards due to ‘quality’ issues.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdGVib29rY2hlY2submV0L2k3LTEyNzAwSC12cy1pNy0xMjY1MEhfMTQwMTNfMTQwNTEuMjQ3NTk2LjAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Core i7-12700H vs Intel Core i7-12650H,"Intel Core i7-12700H

The Intel Core i7-12700H is a high-end mobile CPU for laptops based on the Alder Lake architecture. It was announced in early 2022 and offers 6 performance cores (P-cores Golden Cove architecture) and 8 efficiency cores (E-cores Gracemont architecture). The P-cores support Hyper-Threading leading to 20 supported threads when combined with the E-cores. The clock rate ranges from 2.3 to 4.7 GHz on the performance cluster and 1.7 - 3.5 GHz on the efficient cluster. The performance of the E-cores should be similar to old Skylake cores (compare to the Core i7-6920HQ). All cores can use up to 24 MB L3 cache. Compared to the 12900H the 12700H is lower clocked and offers only ""Essentials"" vPro features.

Performance

The average 12700H in our database wins a very important battle by being ever-so-slightly faster than the AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX in multi-thread benchmarks while perhaps even more importantly nearly matching multi-thread benchmark scores of the more costly Core i9-12900H to be a great bang for the buck overall.

Thanks to its decent cooling solution and a long-term CPU power limit of 101 W the Legion 5 15IAH7H 82RB is among the fastest laptops built around the 12700H that we know of. It can be nearly 60% faster in CPU-bound workloads than the slowest system featuring the same chip in our database as of August 2023.

Features

The integrated memory controller supports various memory types up to DDR5-4800 DDR4-3200 LPDDR5-5200 and LPDDR4x-4267. The Thread Director (in hardware) can support the operating system to decide which thread to use on the performance or efficient cores for the best performance. For AI tasks the CPU also integrates GNA 3.0 and DL Boost (via AVX2). Quick Sync in version 8 is the same as in the Rocket Lake CPUs and supports MPEG-2 AVC VC-1 decode JPEG VP8 decode VP9 HEVC and AV1 decode in hardware. The CPU only supports PCIe 4.0 (x8 for a GPU and two x4 for SSDs).

The integrated graphics adapter is based on the Xe architecture and offers 96 EUs (Execution Units) operating at up to 1.4 GHz.

Power consumption

This Core i7 series chip has a ""minimum assured"" power consumption of 35 W with 45 W being its Base power consumption. The CPU's highest Intel-recommended Turbo power consumption sits at 115 W.

The i7-12700H is built with Intel's 4th generation 10 nm process marketed as Intel 7 for average as of early 2023 energy efficiency.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2ludGVsLWNvcmUtaTktMTI5MDBrLWNvcmUtaTktMTA5ODB4ZS1jcHVzLW5vdy1sb25nZXItYXZhaWxhYmxlLWluLWN1c3RvbS1wYWNrYWdpbmcv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vaW50ZWwtY29yZS1pOS0xMjkwMGstY29yZS1pOS0xMDk4MHhlLWNwdXMtbm93LWxvbmdlci1hdmFpbGFibGUtaW4tY3VzdG9tLXBhY2thZ2luZy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Core i9-12900K & Core i9-10980XE CPUs Now Longer Available In Custom Packaging,"Intel has announced the discontinuation of its custom product packaging for the Core i9-12900K & Core i9-10980XE CPUs. The Core i9-10980XE launched all the way back in 2019 so it makes sense to replace its packaging with a standard boxed one however the Alder Lake chip is recent and it looks like the company has replaced its premium packaging to prepare for the launch of its Raptor Lake chips.

Intel's Core i9-12900K & Core i9-10980XE Will No Longer Be Available In Custom Packaging Back To The Standard Box

Intel has chosen to release the i9-12900K and i9-10980XE with identical size boxes to ensure that shipments will be more optimized for volume cross-generations. The notification comes from the Intel PCN or Product Change Notification documentation.

Initially there was speculation that the Core i9-10980XE would have been discontinued by now but it looks like the chip still serves the HEDT consumer space on the X299 platform though given how old the chip is most users would have moved to newer processors from the company.

2 of 9

The Intel i9-12900K and 12900KS CPUs were initially shipped to consumers in a rectangular-shaped box with a sizeable plastic wafer containing the chip inside. As far as it is known the KS-series will continue to sell in that size of the container while the i9-10980XE changes to reflect the remainder of chips sold.

When shopping for processors it helps to stand out from all other competitors. Intel is known for its unique package designs. Outside of the rectangular designs the company also opted to create hexagonal containers for their chips in the past.

The changes to Intel packaging are not the first time the company has chosen to do this. The Comet Lake and Rocket Lake CPUs also saw the discontinuation of their premium packages right before the launch of the next-gen lineup. Changes to packaging appear before the launch of a new series. The packaging change may or may not reflect the upcoming Raptor Lake processor release.

Leaker OneRaichu shares new benchmark results featuring the flagship Raptor Lake CPU.

The 24-core and 32-thread Raptor Lake processor scores 2290 points in single-core Cinebench R23 test and 35693 points in multi-core. It seems that in this test with default power and clock settings the CPU package reached 254W of power consumption. This level of power is the rumored Turbo/PL2 power limit for the flagship Core i9-13900K CPU.

The same Intel CPU has been tested by ECSM but using different tools. This sample was tested with AIDA64 Stability Test while HWiNFO window was recording behavior of each core. It shows that 2 out of 8 available Raptor Cove cores reached 5.8 GHz at some point throughout the test. The remaining Performance cores were running at 5.5 GHz while all 16 Efficient cores reached a stable 4.3 GHz clock.

For this test 360mm AIO liquid cooler was used while the CPU package reached 90°C temperature and 314W consumption suggesting that this CPU as well was tested with unlimited power.

Figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of longitudinal thermal conductivity κ xx of Pr 2 Ir 2 O 7 measured under zero field by applying the heat current Q parallel to the (001) plane (Q∥(001)). The data are shown together with those of insulating pyrochlore magnets Yb 2 Ti 2 O 7 30 Y 2 Ti 2 O 7 31 Dy 2 Ti 2 O 7 31 and Tb 2 Ti 2 O 7 32 where heat conduction is dominated by phonons. As shown in the inset of Fig. 1a electronic contribution L 0 σ xx T to κ xx estimated using the Wiedemann–Franz (WF) law is more than one order of magnitude smaller than κ xx for both Q∥(001) and Q∥(111) which indicates that heat is predominantly transported by phonons. Interestingly the magnitude of κ xx is extremely small and approaches that of amorphous silica33. Moreover the so-called phonon peak which is characteristic of phononic thermal conductivity in insulating crystalline solids is absent. It is shown that the structural disorder has a negligible effect on the Raman phonon spectra in the sample from the same source34. We thus stress that the low κ xx is not due to phonon scattering by the random disorder. Since a position of the phonon peak is scaled by the Debye temperature which is typically around 300–400 K for pyrochlore oxides35 κ xx for Yb 2 Ti 2 O 7  Y 2 Ti 2 O 7  and Dy 2 Ti 2 O 7 has the peaks at similar temperature (~10 K). At high temperatures exceeding the peak the magnitude of thermal conductivity is set by the rate of collisions between thermally excited phonons whose number is also scaled by the Debye temperature. Thus it is quite reasonable that κ xx for Yb 2 Ti 2 O 7 and Dy 2 Ti 2 O 7 are close to each other at high temperatures.

Fig. 1: Longitudinal thermal conductivity of Pr 2 Ir 2 O 7 . a Temperature dependence of zero-field longitudinal thermal conductivity κ xx for the heat current Q parallel to the (001) plane together with those of the pyrochlore compounds30 -- 32. Inset shows a κ xx vs. T plot in a logarithmic scale for Q∥(001) and Q∥(111). The electronic contribution L 0 σ xx T in κ xx estimated by using the Wiedemann–Franz law is also shown for the electrical current j parallel to the (001) and (111) planes. Magnetic field dependence of longitudinal thermal conductivity normalized by the zero-field value {κ xx (H)−κ xx (0)}/κ xx (0) at different temperatures under the magnetic fields parallel to the [111] and [001] directions are shown in panels b and c respectively. Inset of panel b depicts a \({H}_{\min }\) vs. T plot for H∥[111] and H∥[001]. A zoom of the low field region for the H∥[001] data is shown in the inset of panel c. d Temperature dependence of {κ xx (H)−κ xx (0)}/κ xx (0) at H = 9 T for H∥[111] and H∥[001]. Temperature dependence of the longitudinal electrical resistivity ρ xx at zero field is shown in the inset. e The calculated {κ xx (H)−κ xx (0)}/κ xx (0) as a function of h/J with various values of T/J for H∥[001] where h is the external magnetic field and J is the nearest-neighbor interaction between Pr doublets. Full size image

By contrast in Pr 2 Ir 2 O 7 the phonon peak is absent and κ xx is smaller than those of Y 2 Ti 2 O 7 and Dy 2 Ti 2 O 7 by a factor of five even at high temperatures although our samples are crystalline solids and the Debye temperature of 400 K36 is similar to the other pyrochlore oxides. This suggests the presence of additional scatterers of phonons except for other phonons and disorders. Notably thermal conductivity is also small and the phonon peak is absent in spin liquid candidate Tb 2 Ti 2 O 7 (Fig. 1a) where these striking features are attributed to strong phonon scattering by magnetic fluctuations32. As we see below spin–phonon scattering is a leading mechanism of the low phonon thermal conductivity in Pr 2 Ir 2 O 7 . An intrinsic scattering of phonon by mobile electrons may be an additional thermal impedance of the heat flow.

Resonant phonon scattering and H/T scaling

In Fig. 1b c magneto-thermal conductivity {κ xx (H)−κ xx (0)}/κ xx (0) are shown for H∥[111] and H∥[001] respectively. For both directions κ xx first decreases with field and takes a minimum. On warming a position of minimum defined as \({H}_{\min }\) shifts to higher fields. (See the inset of Fig. 1c for systematic change of \({H}_{\min }\) with temperature for H∥[001].) As shown in the inset of Fig. 1b \({H}_{\min }\) increases linearly with temperature \({H}_{\min } \sim T\) regardless of the field directions. Such a behavior has been observed in various paramagnets and is attributed to resonant scattering between phonons and paramagnetic spins37. We note that this \({H}_{\min } \sim T\) behavior is also discernible for a different sample of Pr 2 Ir 2 O 7 with larger electrical conductivity38 indicating that our observation is an intrinsic property of heat conduction by phonons in this system. The resonance can occur in the presence of a strong spin–phonon coupling when the two-level spin systems split by the Zeeman energy absorb phonon and subsequently emit another phonon of the same energy in an unrelated direction. This spin–flip process effectively scatters phonons. The scattering becomes the largest when the Zeeman splitting ΔE ~ 2Mμ B H (M is magnetization) is equal to phonon energy whose spectrum has a broad maximum at ~4k B T. This causes the minimum in κ xx (H) at \({H}_{\min } \sim 2{k}_{{{{{{{{\rm{B}}}}}}}}}T/M{\mu }_{{{{{{\rm{B}}}}}}}\) with \({H}_{\min }\) proportional to T. Therefore field-induced change in the longitudinal thermal conductivity measured at various temperatures is expected to be scaled as a function of H/T with a minimum at \({H}_{\min }/T \sim 2{k}_{{{{{{{{\rm{B}}}}}}}}}/M{\mu }_{{{{{{\rm{B}}}}}}}\). Such scaling is demonstrated in Fig. 2a b where Δκ xx (H) = κ xx (H)−κ xx (0) normalized by its minimum value \({{\Delta }}{\kappa }_{xx}(H)/{\kappa }_{xx}^{{{{{{\rm{min}}}}}}}\) is plotted against H/T for H∥[111] and H∥[001] respectively. Remarkably all data fall onto the same curve except for H/T > 1 and present minimum at H/T ~ 1. This result unambiguously indicates that κ xx (H) is controlled by the resonant phonon scattering in the region of H < T. For the free Pr3+ ion the magnetization is expected to be M = g J J = 3.2 where g J and J represent the Land\(\acute{{{{{{{{\rm{e}}}}}}}}}\)’s g factor and the total angular moment which gives \({H}_{\min }/T \sim 2{k}_{{{{{{{{\rm{B}}}}}}}}}/3.2{\mu }_{B} \sim 0.93\) in good agreement with our observations. By closer looking at the data however one notices that the minimum position is slightly different with respect to the field directions: \({H}_{\min }/T \sim 1.25\) and 0.75 for H∥[111] and H∥[001] respectively. We will come back to this point later.

Anisotropic deviation from H/T scaling and spin ice correlation

Let us turn our attention to the high field regions. With increasing field {κ xx (H)−κ xx (0)}/κ xx (0) becomes positive (Fig. 1b c) and the H/T scaling becomes failed (Fig. 2a b). Concomitantly we resolved a clear anisotropy in {κ xx (H)−κ xx (0)}/κ xx (0) especially at low temperatures: while {κ xx (H)−κ xx (0)}/κ xx (0) for H∥[111] increases with a concave curvature the one for H∥[001] increases with a convex curvature and shows a tendency to saturate at low temperatures. Since the resonant scattering between phonons and paramagnetic spins is responsible for the negative magneto-thermal conductivity the observed anisotropic recovery of κ xx (H) implies the magnitude of resonant scattering is substantially influenced by spin correlation.

In magnetic materials magnetic fluctuations yield strong scattering on phonons and significantly suppress phononic heat conduction39. An application of a magnetic field however weakens magnetic fluctuations and leads to a striking enhancement of phonon thermal conductivity303240. The observed response of κ xx to magnetic fields can be understood based on this line of thought. In particular anisotropic magneto-thermal conductivity explicitly indicates a vital role of phonon scattering by fluctuating spins with spin ice correlation. In spin ice state41 the spin system fluctuates between the energetically equivalent “2-in 2-out” configurations within the ground state manifold. This gives rise to strong magnetic fluctuations. The macroscopic degeneracy is lifted by the external magnetic field in an anisotropic way4243. Magnetic field along the [001] direction steeply lifts the ground state degeneracy and suppresses the magnetic fluctuations because the stable spin configuration is uniquely determined as one of the six equivalent “2-in 2-out” configurations by the field. For H∥[111] “3-in 1-out/1-in 3-out” configuration is energetically favored in high field limit. However due to a smaller Zeeman energy gain for the spins on the Kagome plane with the “3-in 1-out/1-in 3-out” configuration than the “2-in 2-out” configuration the system remains in spin ice manifold and preserves the strong magnetic fluctuations up to higher field4445.

This anisotropic suppression of magnetic fluctuations brings about positive and anisotropic magneto-thermal conductivity. For H∥[001] the steep suppression of the magnetic fluctuations yields the rapid rise of {κ xx (H)−κ xx (0)}/κ xx (0) (Fig. 1c). Once the polarized state with the “2-in 2-out” configuration is stabilized by the fields and fluctuations are totally suppressed κ xx gets saturated to a value which is purely dominated by phonons. Namely the resonant scattering does not work anymore since the spins are fully polarized in a saturation field and the number of phonons carrying sufficient energy to flip the spin is exponentially suppressed. Meanwhile the persistence of the magnetic fluctuations for H∥[111] yields the slower rise of {κ xx (H)−κ xx (0)}/κ xx (0) (Fig. 1b).

Figure 1d shows temperature dependence of {κ xx (H)−κ xx (0)}/κ xx (0) measured at 9 T for H∥[111] and H∥[001]. On cooling {κ xx (H)−κ xx (0)}/κ xx (0) changes a sign from negative to positive around 4 and 7 K for H∥[111] and H∥[001] respectively. As mentioned above the resonant phonon scattering is strongly influenced by spin correlation through a local exchange field. However by applying a large magnetic field or equivalently at low temperatures the local spin splitting becomes mainly determined by an external magnetic field. This crossover causes a gradual change from negative to positive magneto-thermal conductivity. In that sense the sign-change temperature can be regarded as a lower bound of onset temperature below which the spin-ice correlation sets in. Notably this temperature roughly coincides with a resistivity minimum (see the inset of Fig. 1d) which is another consequence of the spin-ice correlation while in this case the correlated spins interact with conduction electrons46.

Now let us discuss the implication of the spin-ice correlations to the anisotropy in \({H}_{\min }\). Under the spin ice state the Zeeman splitting ΔE ~ 2Mμ B H of the ground state doublet is anisotropic with respect to the field directions due to anisotropy in magnetization M25. Accordingly given the relation of \({H}_{\min } \sim 2{k}_{{{{{{{{\rm{B}}}}}}}}}T/M{\mu }_{{{{{{\rm{B}}}}}}}\) \({H}_{\min }\) is anisotropic and its anisotropic ratio between [111] and [001] directions is expected to be held a relation of \({H}_{\min }^{{{{{{{{\rm{[111]}}}}}}}}}/{H}_{\min }^{{{{{{{{\rm{[001]}}}}}}}}} \sim {M}_{{{{{{{{\rm{[001]}}}}}}}}}/{M}_{{{{{{{{\rm{[111]}}}}}}}}}\). This means that at a given temperature the larger Zeeman splitting ΔE due to the larger M satisfies the condition of resonance at the lower field. In fact the anisotropic ratio of \({H}_{\min }\) \(({H}_{\min }^{{{{{{{{\rm{[111]}}}}}}}}}/T)/({H}_{\min }^{{{{{{{{\rm{[001]}}}}}}}}}/T)=1.25/0.75 \sim\) 1.67 extracted from Fig. 2a b is in good agreement with magnetization anisotropy expected for the “2-in 2-out” configuration \({M}_{{{{{{{{\rm{[001]}}}}}}}}}/{M}_{{{{{{{{\rm{[111]}}}}}}}}}=\{{g}_{J}\J(1/\sqrt{3})\}/\{{g}_{J}\J(1+1/3\times 1)/4\} \sim\) 1.73.

Our argument that the spin–phonon scattering controls the evolution of κ xx (H) is supported by a theoretical calculation. We model the interaction between the Pr doublets by a simple spin-ice-type Ising model. What is characteristic of this compound is the spin–phonon interaction: we assume a linear transverse coupling between the Pr doublets and acoustic phonons. The Pr3+ ion takes f 2 configurations in Pr 2 Ir 2 O 7  and its single-ion ground state is described as a non-Kramers doublet taking E g representation in a D 3d symmetric local crystal field4748. In this case the local transverse component of the doublet has quadrupole nature which enables the linear coupling to lattice deformations or phonons. Even within this simple model we can qualitatively reproduce main experimental features of magneto-thermal transport as shown in Fig. 1e; the initial negative magneto-thermal conductivity the presence of minimum and the positive increase with the convex curvature at the low temperature and a high field region.

Here we note the role of magnetic excitations in thermal transport. In spin ice magnetic monopoles are excited above the temperature of the order of exchange coupling. Indeed the dynamics and transport of monopoles are widely discussed both experimentally and theoretically. However in Pr 2 Ir 2 O 7  we can safely ignore their contribution. Since the magnetic field applied along the [001] direction is unfavorable for the spin ice state the number of monopoles decays faster for H∥[001] than H∥[111]. Therefore if heat is carried by the monopoles κ xx (H) is expected to fall rapidly for H∥[001] than H∥[111]. This is indeed observed in Yb 2 Ti 2 O 7 30 and they raised this behavior as the major evidence for monopole transport. However in our system κ xx (H) falls rapidly for H∥[111]. This observation clearly shows that monopoles do not play a major role in the thermal transport in the measured temperature range. To raise one more evidence for the irrelevancy of monopoles the reduction of κ xx (H) with the field is observed up to as high as 80 K (Fig. 1d) which is much higher than the characteristic temperature of spin ice correlations.

Thermal Hall effect by phonons

Having established the dominant role of spin–phonon scattering in the longitudinal thermal conductivity let us focus on the thermal Hall effect. Temperature dependence of thermal Hall conductivity divided by temperature κ xy /T measured under magnetic field of 9 T for H∥[111] and H∥[001] are shown in Fig. 3a b respectively. In the same figures we also show the electronic contribution L 0 σ xy (left axis) and κ xx /T (right axis). Surprisingly a sign of L 0 σ xy is opposite to κ xy /T in the whole measured temperature range for H∥[111] and T > 4 K for H∥[001] indicating that the thermal Hall effect is mostly governed by carriers except for electrons. Given the negligible contribution of monopoles in κ xx  they are not responsible for the Hall response either. Thus phonons are most probably the unique heat carriers that can cause thermal Hall effect in this paramagnet. Moreover both κ xy /T and κ xx /T peak around 20–30 K where phonons dominate the longitudinal thermal conductivity because electron contribution accounts for only L 0 σ xy T/κ xx ~ 0.6% of the total κ xx (see the inset of Fig. 1a). Such a coincidence of peaks in κ xx and κ xy has been observed in several insulating solids and regarded as a clue to identify the thermal Hall signal generated by phonons15. This result further supports the conjecture that thermal Hall current is carried by phonons in Pr 2 Ir 2 O 7 . We note a ratio κ xy /κ xx ≃ 0.4−0.8 × 10−3 around the peak is comparable to that found in materials where phonons have been argued to cause the Hall effect211.

Fig. 3: Thermal Hall conductivity of Pr 2 Ir 2 O 7 . Temperature dependence of thermal Hall conductivity divided by temperature κ xy /T and L 0 σ xy (left axis) together with longitudinal thermal conductivity divided by temperature κ xx /T (right axis) under the magnetic field of 9 T applied parallel to the [111] and [001] directions are shown in panels a and b respectively. In the inset of panel b our data are compared with those of Tb 2 Ti 2 O 7 4 SrTiO 3 15 and cuprate Mott insulator12. Magnetic field dependence of κ xy (triangles) and L 0 σ xy T (dotted lines) at different temperatures for H∥[111] and H∥[001] are shown in panels c and d respectively. Phonon contribution estimated by \({\kappa }_{xy}^{{{{{{\rm{ph}}}}}}}={\kappa }_{xy}-{L}_{0}{\sigma }_{xy}T\) is also shown by circles. κ xy for H∥[001] seems to approach the L 0 σ xy T value at high fields as displayed in the inset of panel (d). Full size image

At temperatures above the peak the magnitude of κ xy /T is comparable with that of Tb 2 Ti 2 O 7 4 and smaller than the unexpectedly large thermal Hall conductivity of SrTiO 3 15 and La 2 Cu 4 O12 by a factor of 10 (the inset of Fig. 3b). Below the peak κ xy /T steeply decreases faster than κ xx /T. κ xy /T for H∥[001] seems to approach the value expected from the WF law followed by a sign change around 4 K showing that phonons cease to contribute to the Hall response at low temperatures.

In Fig. 3c d we show magnetic field dependence of thermal Hall conductivity κ xy (H) (triangles) together with electron contribution L 0 σ xy T(H) (dotted lines) estimated by using the WF law for H∥[111] and H∥[001] respectively. Again a sign of L 0 σ xy T(H) is opposite to κ xy . By subtracting L 0 σ xy T(H) from κ xy (H) we evaluated thermal Hall conductivity generated by phonons as \({\kappa }_{xy}^{ph}={\kappa }_{xy}-{L}_{0}{\sigma }_{xy}T\) (circles). As seen from the figures at 20 K κ xy (H) increases linearly with H and there is negligible electron contribution in both directions. On cooling κ xy (H) becomes non-monotonic. Namely κ xy (H) shows a peak and subsequently decreases with the field. Moreover a fraction of the electron contribution to κ xy slightly increases which is maximized up to ∣L 0 σ xy T∣/κ xy ~ 28% at 2.9 K and H = 4 T∥[111]. Since the peak remains in \({\kappa }_{xy}^{{{{{{\rm{ph}}}}}}}(H)\) even after the subtraction of electron contribution phonons are responsible for the non-monotonic behavior. By further decreasing temperature an anisotropic field response emerges at high fields. κ xy (H) for H∥[001] is considerably suppressed above its peak field and approaches a value expected from the WF law within an experimental error (the inset of Fig. 3d) consistent with what we saw in the temperature variation of κ xy /T (Fig. 3b). By contrast the suppression is weak for H∥[111] and \({\kappa }_{xy}^{{{{{{\rm{ph}}}}}}}(H)\) remains positive up to 9 T.

Correlation between κ xx and κ xy

One of the most striking findings of this work is a correlation between field-induced change in \({\kappa }_{xy}^{{{{{{\rm{ph}}}}}}}\) and κ xx  which are displayed in the upper and lower panels of Fig. 4 respectively. In each panel we compare two data taken at the (nearly) same temperature for H∥[111] (open circles) and for H∥[001] (closed circles). In Fig. 4 there are several things of interest. (i) The maximum and the minimum appear at nearly the same field in \({\kappa }_{xy}^{{{{{{\rm{ph}}}}}}}(H)\) and Δκ xx (H) respectively and the extreme positions shift to a lower field with decreasing temperature. (ii) Above 7 K the relationship in the magnitude of Δκ xx (H) between the two directions is the same as \({\kappa }_{xy}^{{{{{{\rm{ph}}}}}}}(H)\): the large negative magneto-thermal conductivity is accompanied by the large thermal Hall signal for H∥[111] and vice versa for H∥[001]. (iii) Below 5.1 K steeper Δκ xx (H) rises above its minimum field stronger the suppression of \({\kappa }_{xy}^{{{{{{\rm{ph}}}}}}}(H)\) becomes above its maximum field. Upon cooling this correlation becomes more significant for H∥[001].

Fig. 4: Correlation between longitudinal and transverse thermal conductivity. Magnetic field dependence of thermal Hall conductivity of phonons \({\kappa }_{xy}^{{{{{{\rm{ph}}}}}}}\) (upper panels) and magnetic field-induced change in the longitudinal thermal conductivity Δκ xx = κ xx (H)−κ xx (0) (lower panels) for H∥[111] (open circles) and H∥[001] (closed circles). In panels a and g measurements are performed at T = 2.9 and 2.6 K for H∥[111] and H∥[001] respectively. b h T = 3.5 and 3.8 K for H∥[111] and H∥[001] respectively c i 4.1 K d j 5.1 K e k 7.0 K and f l 20 K. Full size image

From the observation (i) the striking resemblance between \({\kappa }_{xy}^{{{{{{\rm{ph}}}}}}}(H)\) and Δκ xx (H) led us to expect that the H/T scaling is also valid for \({\kappa }_{xy}^{{{{{{\rm{ph}}}}}}}(H)\). As demonstrated in Fig. 2c d the data of \({\kappa }_{xy}^{{{{{{\rm{ph}}}}}}}(H)\) divided by its maximum value indeed collapse on a single curve for both directions for H/T < 1 as in the case of κ xx (H) (Fig. 2a b). Moreover observation (ii) indicates that the strong paramagnetic scattering of phonons that gives rise to the negative magneto-thermal conductivity is an ingredient to enhance the phonon thermal Hall effect. These results provide compelling evidence that a prominent role is played by resonant phonon scattering not only in degrading longitudinal phonon heat conduction but also in generating the transverse signal.

We note that the scaling of \({\kappa }_{xy}^{{{{{{\rm{ph}}}}}}}\) also becomes failed for H/T > 1 (Fig. 2c d) indicating that the paramagnetic scattering no longer plays a major role in this regime. Instead from the remarkable correlation in the observation (iii) it is quite natural to identify another source of asymmetric scattering of phonons as magnetic fluctuations. Whereas the survival of magnetic fluctuations along the [111] direction yields the sizable \({\kappa }_{xy}^{{{{{{\rm{ph}}}}}}}\) even after the paramagnetic scattering dies out the strong suppression of magnetic fluctuations along the [001] direction results in the substantial decrease of κ xy towards the value purely dominated by electrons. Thus it is concluded that whatever the spin state is (whether spins are paramagnetic or correlated) when phonons interact with spins they are asymmetrically scattered and produce the thermal Hall signal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vQnVzaW5lc3MvMjEwMDAtc3VyZ2UtYW10ZC1kaWdpdGFsLWxhdGVzdC1tZW1lLXN0b2NrLWNyYXplL3N0b3J5P2lkPTg3OTIzNTk30gFmaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvQnVzaW5lc3MvMjEwMDAtc3VyZ2UtYW10ZC1kaWdpdGFsLWxhdGVzdC1tZW1lLXN0b2NrLWNyYXplL3N0b3J5P2lkPTg3OTIzNTk3?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,21000% surge of little-known AMTD Digital is latest meme stock craze analyst says,"Wild swings in the share price of a largely unknown Hong Kong-based fintech company in recent days have reminded some analysts and traders of the ""meme stock"" craze which grabbed headlines and stoked controversy early last year.

On Tuesday the stock price of online financial services company AMTD Digital was more than 21000% above the price at its initial public offering last month.

The price fell in recent days to end the week well below the earlier peak but still as of market close Friday the stock price stood at $721 which amounts to a 127% jump for the week and a 9143% increase since its IPO. The stock debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on July 15 at $7.80 per share.

At the height of AMTD Digital's stock rise on Tuesday the company reached a valuation of $310 billion making it larger than Coca-Cola and Bank of America according to FactSet. The nearly 3-year-old company brought in just $25 million in revenue last year according to a regulatory filing.

The dramatic rise in the company's stock price owes to a targeted surge in online retail trading akin to that which sent shares skyrocketing in companies like GameStop and AMC early last year Dan Ives an equities analyst at Wedbush Securities told ABC News.

Some observers however questioned the designation of AMTD Digital as a meme stock.

The phenomenon of a meme stock trade describes a trend in which retail investors see shares rise steeply as others back a firm then more jump into the fray pushing the stock price further upward and enticing another wave of investors. A surge of such trades last year prompted a congressional hearing and investigation.

AMTD Digital did not respond to a request for comment. But a statement released by the company on Tuesday expressed gratitude to investors for the support while acknowledging the stock is ""still undergoing our initial stabilization period.""

""During the period since our initial public offering the Company noted significant volatility in our ADS price and also observed some very active trading volume"" AMTD Digital said.

""To our knowledge there are no material circumstances events nor other matters relating to our Company's business and operating activities since the IPO date"" the company added.

Citron Research an equity research firm rebuked the designation of AMTD Digital as a meme stock citing the relatively low trading volume of shares in the fintech company compared with the run-up last year of GameStop which trades under the symbol GME.

""$HKD is NOT a meme stock"" Citron Research tweeted on Wednesday referring to AMTD Digital by its stock ticker HKD. ""Has not captured the imagination of retail traders like $GME.""

Citron Research said in the tweet that 339000 shares of AMTD Digital were traded on Tuesday.

Almost 900000 individual accounts traded shares of GameStop each day at the height of the trading frenzy last January a dramatic rise from less than 10000 accounts each day earlier that month a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation found.

Still the volatility in the price of AMTD Digital renewed a debate among some over meme stock trading.

""So we're all just going to ignore the $400B meme stock in the room?"" prominent short-seller Jim Chanos tweeted of AMTD Digital on Tuesday. ""We literally had Congressional hearings over the $30B runs of $GME and $AMC but just [crickets] today.""

Ives of Wedbush said the volatility of AMTD Digital in recent days shows that the emergence of a meme stock remains possible even if it has become less common.

""This is more the rarity than the norm"" he said. ""Most of that is in the rearview mirror.""

""But the situation brought to light that the meme era still has oxygen"" he added.",,,,,,,,,

AMERICA's most haunted airport supposedly houses a ghost that chokes sleeping passengers and another that likes to unravel toilet paper in the bathrooms.

Hawaii legend says a blonde lady in a white dress stands at the gate of the Honolulu airport peering out at the runway.

The locals call her ""the Lady in Waiting"" according to HauntedPlaces.org.

The Lady sometimes allegedly appears in secure areas where most people don’t have clearance to go.

Some have reported seeing her wandering the halls and making mischief in the airport bathrooms flushing unoccupied toilets or unraveling toilet paper.

According to the Hawaii legend the woman fell in love with a man who promised to marry her.

The man of her affections took off on an international flight and never returned so she killed herself and yet she still waits for him to return per local folklore.

She apparently isn't the only ghost who calls the Honolulu airport home.

There are stories of people experiencing the sensation of someone sitting on their chest causing them to choke.

The entity that causes this is known as the choking ghost.

Additionally passengers have reported seeing a ghost on the Wiki-Wiki shuttle.

He supposedly appears in the back of the shuttle late at night to startle sleepy passengers.

Other than the Honolulu Airport Hawaii is known to be home to numerous haunted stories.

Places such as the Oahu Community Correctional Facility the Botanical Garden and the Nu'uanu Pali Highway are infamous for ghost stories.

The Hickam Air Force Base and Pearl Harbor are also known to be haunted following Japans attack 1941.

A total of 43231 runners from 10 countries and 18 States participated in the third edition of the Kalaignar Memorial International Marathon organised by Health Minister Ma. Subramanian on Sunday in Chennai.

A large number of residents gathered along the route from Besant Nagar Olcott Memorial School to the Marina Beach on Sunday morning to encourage the participants who included persons with disability.

Chief Minister M.K. Stalin distributed prizes to the winners and some participants. The proceeds of the registration amount of the marathon which has been recorded as the largest ever memorial marathon held in Asia has been handed over to a trust formed for the welfare of the poor patients and their attendants at the government-run Institute of Child Health and Hospital Egmore.

Mr. Subramanian said the registration amount of ₹1.20 crore had been handed over to the trust to provide food and accommodation for patients and their attendants who visit the hospital. “This marathon will create more awareness about health and fitness” he added.

Several participants at the marathon shared details on social media about the initiative taken for the benefit of poor children.

Amarjeet Singh Chawla a runner with visual impairment received a memento from the Chief Minister. He urged the State government to take steps to help the differently abled persons.

Several participants from countries such as Australia Germany Italy New Zealand Seychelles Singapore South Korea and the United Kingdom received the memento from the Chief Minister.

A Reddit user posted a look at what the potential center court of the arena will look like. Based on the video it looks like the arena is going to be a massive one.

If there's a team in the NBA that desperately needs its own arena it's the Los Angeles Clippers. The Clippers regularly receive one of the worst schedules in the NBA because they're the third priority in their arena behind both the Los Angeles Kings and Los Angeles Lakers. Ramona Shelburne revealed in 'The Sterling Affairs' that former Clippers owner Donald Sterling had the chance to make the Clippers have priority over the Lakers but he took too long to commit to Staples Center.

For the Clippers getting a new arena goes beyond just their horrible scheduling system. The team has been developing its own identity for the past decade and creating a new arena is the right step in that direction. For years the Clippers have been associated with a cheap and losing team. Now they've had some of the most wins in the last decade and have the richest owner in the NBA. Creating The Intuit Dome is the next step in associating the LA Clippers as a premier NBA team.

As the focus on the electron microscope resolved Richard Reynolds found himself feeling more resigned than surprised.

The slide before him was a snowpack sample collected from pristine Colorado high country. The sample revealed at intense magnification the snowpack’s expected sprinkling of rock fragments and spikey grains of sand.

It also revealed what shouldn’t have been there at all: long straight human-made fibers of plastic.

The sight confirmed what Reynolds a retired U.S. Geological Survey researcher and his colleagues had suspected after seeing snowpack studies from far away places: An invisible layer of microplastic blankets the Rocky Mountains polluting our snowpack and our water in yet undefined ways.

“It seems to be everywhere” said Reynolds coauthor of a new study of the microplastics detected throughout the Upper Colorado River Basin.

“And there’s a lot of it.”

Fragments of shredded truck tires blown in from nearby highways. Pieces of plastic bottles lifted from a Utah landfill by siroccos and dropped onto Loveland Pass. Detritus from the Pacific garbage patch catapulted by El Nino into the San Juan mountains. The microplastics on the slides are too tiny to offer identities like brand names or shapes. But those distant sources are the initial suspicions of the research team as they plan followup studies on more samples.

A host of wildlife and water quality researchers are likely to descend on the study results to gauge impacts of invisible plastic fibers riding snowmelt into every crevice of the high country. They’ll also be looking for any dangers for the cities downhill that rely on that water.

“Microplastics are very persistent. So where are they going to end up?” said Steven Fassnacht professor of snow hydrology and a senior research scientist at Colorado State University. Fassnacht was not involved in the USGS microplastics study but is familiar with the team’s work.

“I think we’re going to start seeing more and more microplastics in fish and in our drinking water” he said.

For now the immediate news is bad enough: Much like the dark red dust that blows onto the snowpack from Colorado Plateau and Great Basin storms and creates rust-colored layer cakes above treeline the microplastics may absorb sunshine and speed up snowmelt.

The previously known impurities in Colorado snow had already piled on the current 22-year drought and long-term climate change to threaten state water resources and outdoor recreation that rely on deep winters. Darker dust layers are an “accelerant” to early snow loss researchers say. Drought in turn worsens the dust storms by stripping the moisture that binds soil together across the West.

“Climate change is showing its ugly head now” said Jeff Derry a coauthor of the microplastics study and executive director for the Center for Snow and Avalanche Studies which has sensors across the San Juan Mountains. “This year in southern Colorado we saw the snow melt essentially a month early.”

New study adds layer of bad news

Reynolds and USGS researchers Harland Goldstein and Raymond Kokaly had been working with Derry’s center for years to investigate the samples he brought back from high country sites.

Until recently they focused on identifying where the dust in the snow layers blew in from and analyzed mineral content and the physical properties that speed up snowmelt by absorbing more solar energy than pure white snow. This is the “albedo” with a scale that starts at 0 for so dark it absorbs everything up to 1 a perfect reflection of the energy.

But the whole crew was also seeing more and more disturbing journal articles about human-made impurities showing up in samples around the world. So much plastic is produced each year for everything from water bottles to clothing to industrial goods to packaging and so little is recycled that it bumps and shreds and chips and blows and drifts everywhere.

Plastics are fragmented but never degraded at least not in a timespan relevant to life on this planet.

“The world produced 348 million metric tons of plastic in 2017 and this number grows every year by about 5%” begins a study by Utah researchers published in the journal Science in 2020. “A large proportion of this production accumulates as waste in the environment and progressive fragmentation” sends the microplastics abroad on the wind the study said.

The abstract title of their report is “Here there and everywhere.”

“Eleven billion metric tons of plastic are projected to accumulate in the environment by 2025” they add.

The Colorado report’s authors point out that before they retrained more powerful microscopes on their past samples researchers had found airborne microplastics elsewhere in the western United States on Arctic ice floes and high in the Pyrenees and Alps.

“Recently microplastics have been identified in human blood and lung tissue” the Colorado study adds in scientific deadpan.

Standing atop Loveland Pass in mid-July Reynolds said he had noticed straight lines and unnatural filament shapes on some slides in his first pass through some of Derry’s dust samples but had dismissed them as microbes that can assume similar shapes. After reading enough microplastics studies from other continents he realized he and others had missed something.

Derry at first wondered if they had accidentally contaminated the samples. Maybe the straight lines were stray infinitesimal threads from one of his countless shell jackets or skiing gaiters.

But as the Colorado researchers went back through with more powerful tools the plastics were unmistakable. And yet still shocking at least to Derry who lives for work-related backcountry ski runs around Silverton.

“There’s no place that’s safe from our influence and contamination of the Earth” Derry said.

Possible contributors to the microplastics seem endless once you start thinking about how they got to 11000 feet Derry said. The snow and avalanche center has a Colorado Dust-on-Snow Program with sampling sites that sit on passes like Berthoud Rabbit Ears Hoosier McClure and Wolf Creek.

He suspects tires wearing away constantly on mountain highways and even drifting clouds of industrial and consumer microplastics swept into the atmosphere from municipal wastewater biosolids spread on Eastern Plains farms.

The samples in the new Colorado study went through 2016 and the researchers are now seeking samples from more recent snow surveys and new regions. Perhaps the only really useful function of work conferences Reynolds said is that after presenting a new paper everybody in the audience sends you samples.

The Colorado researchers said they saw samples over enough years to make them suspect the microplastics problem is getting worse though they can’t be conclusive yet on this point.

Dozens of samples from water years 2015 and 2016 — water years begin in October to better track one winter’s snowpack and melt — found the frequency of microplastics at the 11 Upper Colorado River Basin sites were greater than in 2013 and 2014.

That doesn’t mean the researchers are ready to conclude the tiny plastic fragments are torching snow banks like a hot black battery pack. They know impurities are bad but they need to study more about plastics’ absorption or reflection of light they said.

“Whether or not our observations indicate an increasing influence of microplastics on snow-surface albedo remains an open question” they conclude.

After the deluge

But it all has to go somewhere right? The snow melts. Faster than ever according to the original research that led to the microplastics discoveries. So what happens to all those microscopic shreds of petroleum-based fibers?

And of course they’re not just getting deposited up high during winter snow and wind storms. Any spring or summer storm is dropping more microplastic straight onto the plants and dirt.

Scientists from any number of fields are now sorting through microplastics studies from the high country and plotting followup research CSU’s Fassnacht said.

The microplastics wash downhill and end up in mountain streams for wildlife to drink or swim and breed in. What happens inside animal bodies if anything? Is more microplastic worse?

Upstream in the food chain do tundra plants and streamside plants take up the microplastics through their roots? How does it impact their growth? What happens when animals eat them?

And then of course there’s the downstream questions. Front Range cities pride themselves on basing their drinking water supplies on snowmelt from the Colorado Arkansas and South Platte river basins. How much of the microplastic ends up at the intake valves for a city water supply? And does water treatment take it all out?

“We rely on that water and these are impurities that we don’t really know much about” Fassnacht said. “We are just starting to evaluate and measure how much is there.”

There are likely to be a series of long-term studies coming out of the microplastics revelations he said. A model could be the decadeslong measuring of atmospheric pollution at Loch Vale in the heart of Rocky Mountain National Park where researchers have measured excess nitrogen deposited from industrial automobile and agricultural pollution on the Front Range.

“We need to look at this as a system and how does it move through the system” Fassnacht said. “Because we may be taking most of it out of the drinking water. But if we’re eating the fish in the rivers …”

Research on the potential toxicity of microplastics in water appears to be in its infancy. A 2019 World Health Organization metastudy found the tiny shards and fibers everywhere in water supplies and wastewater effluent. But the report also said “routine monitoring of microplastics in drinking-water is not recommended at this time as there is no evidence to indicate a human health concern.” Water treatment agencies should never take their eye off the ball of the constant and quantifiable dangers of dangerous microbes the WHO said.

Besides the WHO concluded “it is likely humans have ingested plastic particles for decades as a result of widespread contact with plastics in household objects including cutting boards food packaging and direct contamination in air and food.” The WHO recommended far more research into both the quantity and the potential impacts of microplastics in the water supply.

“Even if you aren’t surprised to hear it it’s still depressing” Derry said of reading through international reports.

California as it is wont to do is regulating first and asking questions later.

High Country News detailed California’s 2021 moves to require drinking water measurements but noted the microplastics field “is still in its infancy. No one knows how widespread microplastics in California’s drinking water really are. There isn’t even a standardized method to test for them. And no one knows what dose may be ‘safe’ to consume since the human health effects are largely unknown.”

Count Aurora Water in the too-early-to-say category. Spokesman Greg Baker said Aurora is not testing for microplastics in its high country water sources around Leadville and in the Arkansas River basin.

Denver Water said it is closely following what it calls an “emerging issue” with microplastics in runoff. Agency officials said they would add monitoring watershed management and treatment if needed to ensure “Denver’s tap water always meets or goes above and beyond” strict federal water quality standards.

Try not to think about what’s underfoot

Geologists live to learn what they are stepping on.

On hikes and other outings Reynolds brings a magnetic susceptibility meter the size of a wallet to hover over snow dust layers or trailside rocks. With a click Reynolds sees the level of iron oxide arrayed before him and can make an educated guess on how deep into Utah a given dusty layer came from.

After Reynolds and Derry met on Loveland Pass in mid-July to talk microplastics Reynolds put the meter in his pocket slung on a backpack and hiked straight up the ridge toward Mount Sniktau. He spent most of the hike thinking about oxygen or lack thereof at 11990 feet. But the persistent microplastics questions returned when he was back in his car.

How much of the potentially toxic shred is out there? Will Derry find much more in the samples he’s taken since 2017?

Will scientists zero in on where all the plastic is coming from and will that lead to ways to stop it?

How toxic might the fibers and shards prove to plants to wildlife to humans?

In microplastics as in all of science Reynolds said “I am continuously humbled by what I don’t know.”",,,,,,,,,

Fast forward to today and the northern region of Malaysia is heating up with record levels of investments and re-investments pouring in amounting in the billions of ringgit (see table).

But some interesting dynamics are taking place which could impact this semicon boomtown story for Malaysia.

For starters with so much new production being built is there a fear that the industry is heading into an oversupply situation?

This is more so given the recession headwinds impacting the global economy.

Then there’s the new law passed by the United States government. Dubbed the Chips (Creating Helpful Initiatives to Produce Semiconductors for America) Act the new law is aimed at drawing investment and production of semiconductors back to US shores.

“The shortage of the right talent is a big hurdle for Mida to attract foreign direct investment.”Datuk Arham Abdul Rahman

Will this then lead to a slowdown of investments coming into countries like Malaysia?

And yet another hot topic that is likely to add to the semiconductor saga is the heating up of geopolitical risks related to Taiwan.

US House Speaker Nancy Patricia Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan has escalated tensions between Taiwan and China. Fears of reprisals from China could pose a critical problem to the global supply of chips as Taiwan is home to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) the largest contract chipmaker in the world.

First the potential oversupply situation. Not only are the multinational firms ramping up their semiconductor-related operations in Malaysia but large local players are also doing the same.

For example Unisem (M) Bhd one of the largest assembly and testing players in the country is building a new production facility in Gopeng at a cost of RM300mil the first phase of which will be completed by next April.

Automated test equipment (ATE) manufacturer ViTrox Corp Bhd plans to invest between RM80mil and RM100mil in a new expansion project in Batu Kawan this year adding 447000 sq ft of floor space.

Globally also there are as many as 10 wafer fabrication plants (fabs) being built. China has been racing to get a stronger foothold in semiconductors throwing billions of dollars into the sector and building up capacity as quickly as they can.

Now more such operations are likely to get kickstarted in the US considering the financial allocations given by the US government via the Chips Act.

Wong: Malaysia needs to employ talent from other countries as well to resolve the shortage of engineers in the industry.

Cyclical industry

The semiconductor industry is a notoriously cyclical one. Manufacturers are constantly pressured to come up with new technologies that create smaller transistors.

Additionally fab construction and production boosts are slow and costly. Competition is ruthless. Companies risk losing out by the time their expansion plans are completed if their manufacturing know-how is behind their peers.

S&P Global Ratings pointed out this week that the global semiconductor cycle is heading for a downturn due to an ease in demand for consumer electronics. UOB Kay Hian Research in a recent report also projected global semiconductor sales to slow down in 2023 stemming from the expectation of a demand slowdown in the consumer electronics segment.

Deutsche Bank Research said in May that the current semiconductor cycle which began in October 2019 has been running for 29 months already above the historical average of 27.7 months.

But aren’t these exceptional times? It does seem so at least going by one industry veteran’s view. Datuk Seri Wong Siew Hai the president of the Malaysia Semiconductor Industry Association (MSIA) puts it like this: “There just seems to be no sign of a slowdown in the industry”.

Speaking to StarBizWeek via a Zoom interview Wong adds “So far the cyclical effect of the industry has not kicked in. The strong demand for chips has just persisted over the last two years.”

Wong notes that companies in the semiconductor ecosystem are going ahead with their expansion plans and that globally there are 10 fabs being built this year and another 10 next year.

He notes the supply crunch of chips worldwide was brought on largely by the pandemic that accelerated the demand for chips in the consumer electronics and automotive industries.

“During the pandemic many people were working from home so the sales of computers went up because they needed to set up their home offices.

“There was also a surge in gaming and eCommerce activities. Then there is the automotive industry that saw an increased number of people opting to buy cars instead of taking public transportation.

“All these activities need chips not excluding medical devices as well” Wong says.

He also explained that the situation was further exacerbated by fab closures in the US and Taiwan due to droughts the interruption of chip manufacturing operations in Germany due to power outages and the implementation of lockdowns and movement control orders in some countries including Malaysia which disrupted the production of semiconductors.

Wong however does not rule out a slowdown in the sector in the event of a full blown recession hitting countries across the globe or the outbreak of new wars.

Analysts say that despite the massive semiconductor supply coming into the market demand has never been so strong because of new industries being created that need more and more chips.

These include sectors like automotive computation and data storage and wireless.

McKinsey in its report this year projected 70% of growth in the chip industry will be driven by the aforementioned three industries.

The automotive industry is singled out to be the strongest growing segment whereby the demand for chips could triple by the end of the decade.

Last week MIDF Research pointed out that Singapore’s manufacturing output which grew at 13.8% year-on-year as at May 2022 was underpinned by higher production of semiconductors. This in turn stemmed from strong demand from 5G markets and data centres the report said.

Impact of US Chips Act

A significant development taking place in the global semiconductor space is the US passing the new Chips Act.

The law is aimed at helping the US regain its footing in chip manufacturing and becomes less dependent on foreign countries for crucial technologies.

Will it be a boon or bane for Malaysia’s semiconductor industry?

Chew Ne Weng who runs QES Group Bhd a niche Shah Alam-based ATE manufacturer reckons it is a huge boon for Malaysia.

“The Chips Act is overall very good for the semiconductor industry be it in the US Taiwan Japan as well as for players like us in South-East Asia.

Many companies in the ecosystem will enjoy the ‘waterfall effect’ of what the US will be doing. Malaysia is the main test and assembly packaging of integrated circuits for many US based multinationals such as Intel Micron Technology Inc and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.”

MSIA’s Wong concurs. He explains that Malaysia and South-East Asia will become beneficiaries of the legislation as the Chips Act is focused on encouraging companies like Samsung TSMC and Intel to build their leading edge manufacturing plants in the US and not so much for the “trailing edge” or back end part of the sector.

“We will benefit from the Chips Act because these corporations still need to outsource the packaging and testing services of semiconductors to other countries.

“As of now Malaysia is not vying to attract wafer fabs into the country. We will only see the downsides of the Chips Act if Malaysia intends to do so” he says.

In fact Wong suggests that Malaysian-based semiconductor players ought to be seriously looking at expanding their capacity and eyeing to secure the expected new orders that will come from the US stemming from the effects of the Chips Act.

“We have to expand our capacity of testing and assembly and other back end services to support the new volume of wafers coming out” he says.

Geopolitics and semiconductors

Politics seem to be increasingly impacting the chip industry one way or the other. For example the recently passed Chips Act is their government’s move to ensure the country has the security of supply of chips for its industries.

And what the US is doing has already long been done by China. As pointed out recently by the New York Times China’s drive to catch up and manufacture the most advanced chips is part of its “Made in China 2025” programme an effort that began in 2015.

The US-based Semiconductor Industry Association reckons that by 2030 China will have the largest stake in global semiconductor production due to its government’s significant investments in this sector.

Meanwhile tensions between China and Taiwan have escalated in recent days following Pelosi’s visit to the island.

At the height of her visit the shares of TSMC took a hit. It has recovered some of those losses but still trades lower than what it did at the end of last month.

Meanwhile TSMC’s chairman Mark Liu has told the media that if Taiwan were invaded by China the chipmaker’s plant would not be able to operate because it relies on global supply chains.

Experts also believe that a China conflict with Taiwan would severely disrupt the global chip technology supply chain.

In an article by Fortune this week an expert was quoted as saying that TSMC is the most irreplaceable company in the world today.

An economist was also quoted to say that Dutch firm ASML which works closely with TSMC to produce advanced microchips would likely move its key personnel out of Taiwan before any Chinese takeover.

Interestingly ASML is one of the global top names in the semiconductor industry to have a presence in Malaysia.

Another big firm here is Lam Research a leading US supplier of wafer fabrication equipment which invested RM1bil for a new plant in Penang which opened last year.

Lam Research is listed on Nasdaq with a market capitalisation of US$71.54bil (RM319bil) and its presence in Penang has spurred on the local industry there.

Another biggie in Malaysia is Jabil Circuit Inc a global provider of design engineering manufacturing and supply chain solutions which over the last few years has expanded its operations in the Batu Kawan Industrial Park.

This week Malaysian Investment Development Authority’s (Mida) chief executive Datuk Arham Abdul Rahman praised Jabil Penang’s efforts in accelerating automation and digitalisation initiatives through its partnerships with local vendors in Malaysia.

Meanwhile Wong points out how geopolitical tensions could work to Malaysia’s advantage.

“Because of the tension between the US and China some of them have been looking at Malaysia as a so-called neutral place for investment” he says.

He adds that many global companies seek to mitigate operational risks by building their factories in multiple regions. There is also a need to get closer to customers such as those already in Penang or Kulim he says.

But with so many companies coming into Penang and existing ones ramping up production is the infrastructure there stable enough to cater to this boomtime?

Available land for new plants in hot spots like Batu Kawan in Penang and the Kulim Hi-Tech Park in Kedah is hard to find and not to mention rising quickly in prices. Then there’s the concern of water and electricity as these plants consume a lot of it.

Nevertheless MSIA’s Wong opines that other than Penang which has issues with water availability Malaysia on a whole has enough water to support the semiconductor ecosystem.

“The usage of water is rising because many factories are coming into Malaysia. However Malaysia has sufficient water supply it is just a matter of location.

“Penang is among the few states that has water supply issues but this is not really concerning. Companies can choose to build their factories in other states like Kedah if Penang is unable to support the project. This is what is happening right now” he says.

Wong notes the main crux of the problem is actually the shortage of workers at every level. Although there are no definite reasons as to why the majority of Malaysians choose not to work in factories Wong speculates that it may be due to their preference for the gig economy which offers a more flexible working environment.

“When we talk about labour shortage in the chip industry we are not referring to unskilled workers. In this sector we need workers who have proper education at least up to Form Five or Form Six in order to be able to be qualified to be trained as professional personnel in the factories” he says.

Wong adds that Malaysia needs to employ talent from other countries as well to resolve the shortage of engineers in the industry.

“This shortage is also related to the number of students studying science and engineering in the country.

“The government should look into having programmes like other countries are doing that allow chip companies to hire students upon graduating to work for at least two years and the suitable candidates can be hired following that.”

Mida’s Arham concurs. He says the shortage of the right talent is a big hurdle for Mida to attract foreign direct investments.

“Although many big companies automate their production they still require the right talents to run the machines and the production lines.

“Whenever Mida approaches foreign investors to invest in Malaysia one of their main concerns is regarding the talent situation in our country” he says.

One thing is for sure the experts agreed regardless of geographical location or incentives Malaysia has the potential to not only maintain its existing semiconductor ecosystem but expand it as well.

“Malaysia is very strategically located in Asean and can act as a base to cater to other markets in the region.

“We are also one of the countries in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership that includes about one third of the world’s population. All these factors give Malaysia the edge when it comes to attracting more foreign direct investments into the country” says Arham.

Wong says that a strong ecosystem business-friendly government as well as having the right talent to move the chip industry are the reasons for Malaysia being an attractive place for investments.

“This year MSIA is celebrating 50 years. This means we have 50 years of experience in the semiconductor industry. We have the contractors technical consultants who know how to construct chip manufacturing factories.

We also have a business-friendly government with initiatives and task forces like the Express Construction Permit and Pemudah that are committed to reduce red tape and facilitate investments” he says.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Financial Health and Profitability: JKHY's financial health is a cornerstone of its strength with a solid balance sheet and an increase in net income to $87099 for the third quarter up from $81549 in the prior year. This financial stability is supported by a disciplined approach to cost management as seen in the total expenses of $426463 which have been effectively controlled in relation to the revenue growth. The company's profitability is not only a sign of operational efficiency but also provides the necessary capital to reinvest in growth initiatives and shareholder returns.

Weaknesses

Dependence on Financial Sector Clients: A primary weakness for JKHY is its reliance on the financial sector with a customer base predominantly composed of banks and credit unions. While this focus has contributed to the company's deep expertise and strong market position it also exposes JKHY to sector-specific risks such as regulatory changes and economic downturns that disproportionately affect the financial industry. Diversifying its client portfolio could mitigate this risk and provide more stability during industry fluctuations.

Increasing Operating Expenses: Despite robust revenue growth JKHY's operating expenses have also risen with a 6.6% increase in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. This uptick in expenses particularly in selling general and administrative costs which climbed by 7.0% may squeeze margins if not carefully managed. JKHY must continue to seek efficiencies and control costs to maintain its profitability and invest in strategic areas.

Opportunities

Technological Advancements: The ongoing digital transformation in the financial services industry presents significant opportunities for JKHY. By continuing to invest in cutting-edge technologies such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence JKHY can offer innovative solutions that address the evolving needs of its clients. The company's commitment to research and development as indicated by the $35993 investment in the third quarter positions it well to capitalize on these technological trends and expand its product offerings.

Market Expansion: JKHY has the opportunity to expand its market reach by targeting larger financial institutions and exploring international markets. With its strong product portfolio and expertise in the financial sector JKHY can leverage its reputation to attract a broader clientele. Additionally strategic partnerships or acquisitions could accelerate this expansion and introduce JKHY's solutions to new customer segments.

Threats

Competitive Pressure: The financial technology industry is highly competitive with numerous players vying for market share. JKHY faces the threat of emerging fintech startups and established technology firms that are expanding their financial services offerings. To remain competitive JKHY must continue to innovate and differentiate its products while delivering exceptional customer service.

Economic Uncertainty: Economic downturns can significantly impact JKHY's client base leading to reduced spending on technology solutions and services. The company's dependence on the financial sector makes it vulnerable to such macroeconomic factors. JKHY must maintain a strong financial position and adapt its offerings to help clients navigate challenging economic conditions.

Jacobs might not be a superstar but he is a starting-caliber running back that should receive plenty of interest if the Raiders make him available.

Josh Jacobs Trade: Five Potential Team Fits

Philadelphia Eagles

On paper the Philadelphia Eagles should have one of the most lethal rushing attacks in football. Their offensive line is arguably the best in the league the offensive weapons will prevent teams from stacking the box and Jalen Hurts is one of the most electric rushers in the sport. The only thing the team is missing is a great starter.

Miles Sanders is an adequate option but there is no denying that Jacobs is a superior talent. Thanks to their many trades over the years the Eagles have plenty of draft capital heading into 2022 and would likely have no issue with sending a late-round pick to the Raiders in exchange for Jacobs’ services.

Baltimore Ravens

Injuries decimated the Baltimore Ravens backfield last year and the team still hasn’t recovered from the onslaught of health issues. JK Dobbins and Gus Edwards are still on the Physically Unable to Perform (PUP) list meaning that if the season started today the Ravens would go into battle with Mike Davis and Justice Hill battling it out for the starting job.

Needless to say this is not an ideal situation for any team. Dobbins and Edwards will be back in the lineup eventually but even when they’re back on the field they probably won’t be ready for their old workload right out of the gate. Jacobs would be the ideal fit to serve as starter early in the season before forming a dangerous three-headed backfield once Dobbins and Edwards are fully back to their old selves.

Buffalo Bills

It’s no secret that the Buffalo Bills are looking to upgrade the running back position. The team tried to recruit J.D. McKissic in the offseason and used a second-round pick on running back James Cook in the 2022 NFL Draft. Cook will likely handle most of the work in the passing game but Buffalo could look to Jacobs if they want to ease the burden on Devin Singletary.

Singletary is set to handle the vast majority of the early-down work as Zack Moss simply doesn’t look like a regular NFL contributor. Bringing in Jacobs would allow the Bills to have a fierce 1-2 punch on early downs with Cook coming on to handle passing duties.

Houston Texans

The Houston Texans have needs at every position and that includes running back. Right now the team is set to enter the season with fourth-round rookie Dameon Pierce leading the backfield. That is obviously not an ideal situation and Jacobs would easily be the best back on the roster. Additionally Raiders head coach Josh McDaniels and Texans general manager Nick Caserio both got their start in New England so there is likely a connection between the two.

New Orleans Saints

Superstar running back Alvin Kamara is currently staring down a suspension. While his hearing was moved back to October he might have to miss up to six games later in the year. Kamara is still one of the best running backs in the league and the Saints do not have a Plan B if he misses time. Jacobs could essentially serve as the 2018 version of Mark Ingram in this offense spelling Kamara on running downs while being a starting-caliber fill-in if Kamara has to miss time.

The Raiders’ decision to play Josh Jacobs extensive snaps in Thursday’s Hall of Fame game raised some eyebrows. After all his offensive peers — Derek Carr Davante Adams and Hunter Renfrow — all watched the game from the sideline befitting their veteran status and coach Josh McDaniels’ intent to protect them from injury in a relatively meaningless exhibition game.

So why was Jacobs a valuable veteran cog of the Raiders’ offense on the field let alone for a considerable time?

Turns out McDaniels had valid reasoning or as he put it when asked: “We made the decisions that we thought were the right decisions for our team.”

And it had nothing to do with social media’s instant reaction suggesting the Raiders were showcasing Jacobs for a trade.

“I always think it’s good for backs to carry the ball in preseason” McDaniels said simply.

As far as the showcasing theory there is no feeling whatsoever that the Raiders are shopping Jacobs. In spite of the club opting against picking up the former Alabama standout’s fifth-year option and thus opening the possibility of him leaving via free agency next March he is viewed as an important piece of their 2022 puzzle.

Despite having quality depth at running back and the certainty that the Raiders will either trade or release an NFL-caliber running back Jacobs is expected to return as the lead back.

In fact by reporting to camp in top shape and producing a dazzling start to camp Jacobs has only reaffirmed his value.

What he means to the Raiders in the short and long term is an important consideration when contemplating any trade. The club is in win-now mode and Jacobs factors in as a key component of the stout run game McDaniels wants to build.

Long term even if Jacobs leaves as a free agent next year the Raiders are likely to get draft-pick compensation even as high as a third-round pick.

That can’t be ignored as successful teams have been leaning heavily on the comp-pick game to help restock their rosters with young affordable talent after letting higher-priced veterans leave in free agency.

The Raiders now under the leadership of McDaniels and general manager Dave Ziegler are well versed in that approach. The Patriots’ expert use of the comp-pick game helped them build and maintain a dynasty that covered multiple decades.

Down the line Jacobs can provide that sort of value.

Presently though he means more to the Raiders as a player than a trade asset.

McDaniels cognizant of the need to get Jacobs rolling and to develop chemistry with a young offensive line used Thursday to expedite the process. In doing so he displayed a thought process that while unconventional in some quarters reflects his own thinking and philosophies.

Specifically it reflects how he views the running back position relative to training camp and preseason preparation.

“There are a lot of things that happen when you’re tackled and getting hit that you can’t simulate in practice” said McDaniels who has prohibited such hits during training camp.

That not only explains using Jacobs on Thursday but also his primary backup Kenyan Drake. In fact the only veteran back who didn’t get on the field was Brandon Bolden.

“All our guys either caught it or were handed the ball and got tackled” McDaniels said. “We can’t really simulate or rep that in practice.”

The Las Vegas Raiders ""are not planning on trading"" veteran running back Josh Jacobs according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.

Rapoport added the Raiders could likely find a market for Jacobs but ""do not plan"" to move the 2020 Pro Bowler because they're looking to win games now.

Jacobs ran the ball five times for 30 yards and caught two passes for 14 yards in Las Vegas' 27-11 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars in the Hall of Fame Game.

Pro Football Talk's Mike Florio speculated whether the 24-year-old's relatively high usage was part of a plan by the Raiders to showcase him for prospective trade suitors.

The Raiders declined Jacobs' fifth-year rookie option in April which is almost always a sign that a first-round pick hasn't lived up to expectations.

Jacobs eclipsed 1000 rushing yards both in 2019 and 2020 but his 4.0 yards per carry over the last two seasons raise some concerns. Football Outsiders ranked him 35th in DYAR among running backs with at least 100 carries in 2021.

The former Alabama star told reporters in July that he hopes to stay in Las Vegas.

""I'm a firm believer in the work that you put in is going to pay out for itself and I had to be here either way"" he said. ""And this is where I want to be. I didn't have no problem with it. It just gave me more of a reason to come in every day gel with the guys and work.""

But with a new general manager (Dave Ziegler) and a new head coach (Josh McDaniels) in place nobody will be surprised if the Raiders have a new starting running back in 2023.

Perhaps the change comes earlier than that but Rapoport provided compelling reasons why the team should keep Jacobs for at least one more year. This isn't a Super Bowl-or-bust season for the Raiders but they clearly have big ambitions.

They acquired Davante Adams from the Green Bay Packers and signed him to a massive extension. They signed Chandler Jones to pair with Maxx Crosby at defensive end. And Crosby is one of a few Raiders players who was handsomely rewarded with a new deal.

If Vegas did trade Jacobs it would be looking at fourth-round draft pick Zamir White Ameer Abdullah or Kenyan Drake as its primary ball-carrier. Drake and Abdullah combined to run for 420 yards in 2021 while White slipped to Day 3 of the draft for a reason.

""Overall White would be best paired with a more finesse-style back who allows him to get touches that take advantage of his hard runs"" B/R NFL scout Nate Tice wrote in his scouting report. ""He can be an effective back very early in his career in an offense that features downhill runs that lets him set the tone but he has a cap on his passing-down value."""

On Wednesday afternoon a photo was captured of Pedro Pascal and Dakota Johnson kissing quite passionately on the streets of New York where Pascal was seen in a tan blazer and a brown dress shirt while Johnson wore a leather jacket over a white tee. Naturally the image of the two locking lips went viral leading fans to believe this was the sign of a new Hollywood relationship. Turns out it was all just a moment of movie magic.

The pair was caught smooching in TriBeCa as they filmed their new romantic comedy Materialists. Directed by Celine Song—whose debut feature film Past Lives was nominated for Best Picture this year—the upcoming flick follows the dynamic between a matchmaker a wealthy man she meets and her ex. In addition to Johnson and Pascal the movie also stars Chris Evans Zoë Winters Dasha Nekrasova Louisa Jacobson and Marin Ireland.

Materialists just began filming in New York in late April according to World of Reel. There is no confirmed release date yet but the movie is being distributed by A24 and produced by 2AM and Killer Films.

To make matters even more interesting about a week ago Johnson was seen filming a scene with costar Evans and in a few paparazzi photos the pair were captured kissing during their shoot as well. Materialists is clearly going to be a steamy film to say the least.

Johnson is fresh off the release of superhero film Madame Web while Evans just wrapped his Christmas action-comedy Red Ones which costars Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and is set to hit theaters on November 15. Meanwhile Pascal has a lot on his plate as he just finished filming Gladiator II in January and is also starring in the noir thriller Tropico which just began filming in April.

But there was more geniality than specificity in private meetings with Gov. J.B. Pritzker and legislative leaders just three weeks before a self-imposed May 24 spring session adjournment date.

Democrats were prepared to talk to Johnson about his Monday reference to $1 billion owed to Chicago Public Schools due to years of underfunding under the state’s school funding formula — but the issue wasn’t even broached during a nearly 30-minute meeting with the governor.

And the mayor’s controversial support for a new lakefront Chicago Bears stadium also wasn’t a focal point of the meeting.

Johnson told reporters he reminded Pritzker and legislative leaders that Chicago is the economic engine of the state and deserves its “fair share of resources.

“It’s also to continue to build relationships with the opportunity that we have in this moment as a state to really build the type of operation that speaks to equity injustice. This is a unique chance for us to do that” Johnson said of his trip. “So it’s a level-setting. It’s making sure that we’re building on relationships but it’s also clear that in order for the state of Illinois to be the great state that it is that the city of Chicago has to have its fair share of resources.”

Johnson called discussions with the Illinois General Assembly about the Bears “ongoing” dubbing Soldier Field a “structural damaged situation that really needs a solution.” The Bears last week met with Pritzker aides who highlighted their opposition to the plan. The governor’s office last week called the proposal a “nonstarter” after the meeting.

“And that’s what this is about providing solutions to a problem … like everything else I’ve inherited” Johnson said.

It was the Chicago mayor’s first trip to the state capitol since taking office. Johnson also met with Pritzker and legislative leaders in Springfield in April 2023 in a ceremonial visit weeks before he was sworn in.

Johnson defended the timing of his visit — and his late-in-the-game budgetary asks — saying “We’re at the right time.”

“You know when stuff gets done. So we’re down here at the right time” Johnson said.

Several members of the Chicago City Council Black Caucus also met privately with Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch on Wednesday in what was dubbed an informal city lobbying day. Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) the mayor’s hand-picked Education Committee chair said it marked the first time in five years that members of the caucus had come to Springfield.

“The thing we’ll do next year is we’ll come in January. We come earlier. We get earlier access” Taylor said. “We can get a lot of those things that we’re looking for.”

Taylor said her requests included funding for infrastructure and investments in education some narrower than the mayor’s.

“He’s advocating for some of the same things we are but remember it’s 50 other folks. It’s just 20 of us as the Black Caucus and so he’s advocating on the entire city. We have specific asks for the South and West sides” Taylor said.

“Him coming down is a great thing. Him coming down with us didn’t make or break us because now the other caucuses have to do their due diligence to come down here as well.”

During Johnson’s closed-door meetings the Illinois Senate Executive Committee quietly cleared an education measure that Johnson and the Chicago Teachers Union had opposed.

The bill was initially intended to stop the Chicago Board of Education from closing or making any changes to selective enrollment schools until 2027 when the board will be fully elected. It was a response to a resolution passed by the CPS board that called for a plan to invest in neighborhood schools and move away from school choice.

The measure the Senate committee passed Wednesday cleared the House last month. It included a moratorium on all Chicago school closings until 2027 — and it would also stop the Chicago Board of Education from changing standards of admission for selective enrollment schools. The measure must still clear the full Senate.

Johnson said he has had discussions with lawmakers to amend the measure: “Those amendments are being assessed and analyzed now.”

As for whether he felt snubbed by the Senate’s approval during his visit the mayor countered that he understood the “process.”

“There’s a process that the General Assembly goes through” Johnson said. “I understand that process and we’re going to stick to that process.”

Out of another set of windows eight new outdoor fields and a white dome that went up in late June where organizers can host youth tournaments year-round regardless of the notoriously crummy weather in northeast Ohio in the winter and spring.

On the back side of the Constellation Center where patrons for Hall of Fame Weekend used to drive up the hill from I-77 and park in driveways and front yards for $10 to $30 a pop — plus another $1 for lemonade — there’s a view of a brand new parking lot and roads plus a green space for food trucks a zipline and a Ferris wheel.

And on the east side of the offices there are acres of bulldozed land where a hotel and water park will be built by the end of next year plus an impressive boxy slab of elevated concrete where bars and restaurants will begin to open by the end of the month. And of course there is the hallowed Hall itself football’s museum since its grand opening in 1963.

On the top floor of the Constellation Center on a rainy Wednesday last month more than 50 employees from the Pro Football Hall of Fame ate barbecue ribs and hot dogs under exposed ceiling wiring.

They were guests of Michael Crawford and the Hall of Fame Village powered by Johnson Controls the formal name for what’s been referred to as the “Disneyland of football” since the idea was first conceived almost seven years ago. A former Disney executive who has overseen the project since the end of 2018 Crawford has the project barreling toward completion. Hundreds of construction workers along with trucks cranes and steel beams dot the property.

The lunch for the Hall of Fame employees — they don’t work for Crawford as the Hall and the Village are separate entities — was a celebration of progress held about a month before the arrival of the Las Vegas Raiders the Jacksonville Jaguars the Class of 2022 enshrinees and hundreds of thousands of people in Canton for Hall of Fame Weekend.

The restaurants bars hotel waterpark and Ferris wheel wouldn’t be ready for this year’s festivities but the progress is tangible. Buildings are going up the calendar is getting full and people are beginning to visit.

That’s what Crawford focused on during his short speech: progress and thanks for patience. As he spoke a line of thunderstorms moved in from the west. The skies darkened and thick clouds boomed with trouble.

The Village is $100 million in debt. It lost $92 million in 2021. Johnson Controls an international HVAC firm wants its name scrubbed from the project entirely because of a $4.75 million payment it says was missed. Nasdaq has warned the Village that its stock price was too low and risked being booted out of the exchange.

None of these troubles are secrets. They have been covered ad nauseam in the local press and remain very real hurdles Crawford and his team must clear. In fact there has been an enormous amount of pain sacrifice and setbacks in the building of the “Disneyland of football” over the last seven years including the dismissal of the man whose idea the Village was in the first place.

But some in attendance at that lunch know without the Village surrounding the Hall despite all the baggage that’s come with it Canton may have lost the Hall of Fame Game and worse the enshrinement ceremony.

On Thursday the Raiders played the Jaguars in the first NFL game of the new season. This preseason exhibition has been played every year in Canton since 1962 save for the two times it was canceled. On Saturday Tony Boselli Cliff Branch LeRoy Butler Art McNally Sam Mills Richard Seymour Dick Vermeil and Bryant Young will join the 346 Hall of Famers before them with bronze busts and gold jackets.

But when C. David Baker was hired as the Hall of Fame’s executive director in 2014 commissioner Roger Goodell his advisors and some team owners were considering doing away with the game and moving enshrinement out of Canton and out of August multiple sources told The Athletic. A new plan would involve moving the ceremony to a different NFL city every year.

“There just wasn’t a whole lot for Roger or the league to be excited about in Canton” said one source familiar with Goodell’s thinking.

What were the league’s issues with Canton?

To begin with the old stadium next to the Hall Fawcett Stadium was built in 1938 and crumbling. The locker rooms were glorified bathrooms. Most of the seating was on one side of the field. There was a chain-link fence behind the south end zone and fans could sit on a hill and watch the game in the north end. Watching games there had a minor-league feel and the NFL doesn’t do minor league.

Additionally Canton like so many old steel towns in the midwest had fallen on hard times economically. The previous decade was especially harsh as factory closures from 2000 to 2004 cost the city and its surrounding communities thousands of jobs. The NFL wasn’t going to penalize Canton for that but the fallout meant a lack of development around the Hall.

There was one downtown hotel and it had become dilapidated to the point where league dignitaries teams and enshrinees weren’t even staying in Canton for Hall of Fame Weekend. There was no entertainment or ambiance near the Hall. Former NFL standout Chris Spielman a local bought an old horse barn in 1992 and turned it into a football-themed restaurant. It lasted about a decade.

While Canton wouldn’t lose the Hall itself losing the festivities surrounding Hall of Fame Weekend would have been a fate worse than the one that befell the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland which has split induction ceremonies with New York City every other year since 2018.

“Could that have been the model for Canton where the Hall of Fame is based here but the pomp and circumstance around the enshrinement of a new class is held in this glitzy setting in New York or Los Angeles? Yeah I think that crossed some people’s minds” said Richard Desrosiers spokesman for the Pro Football Hall of Fame during an interview in his office at the Hall with a view of the stadium from his window.

“I think that was part of the vision that developed here seven eight years ago to say ‘Hey it’s time for a refresh here'” Desrosiers said.

A spokesman for Goodell did not respond to multiple messages seeking comment and Baker declined to comment when reached by The Athletic but sources said Baker’s “Disney” vision was his plan for keeping those iconic events in the city where the NFL was founded in 1920.

Baker a 6-foot-9 bear of a man whose son was an NFL lineman went big. He knew he needed to fix the stadium first and approached his friend New Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson for a contribution to get the project started. Benson who died in March 2018 kicked in $11 million in return for his name going on the new stadium.

Construction began in August 2015 just after the Hall of Fame Game that summer. The following year disaster struck. The turf at the old Fawcett Stadium was deemed unplayable about an hour before the Packers were to play the Colts and the game was canceled.

The disaster could have meant the end of the game in Canton but Baker’s Hall of Fame Village project was already underway complete with a $476 million price tag. It called for not only a new stadium but also a hotel a waterpark a sports bar an indoor arena outdoor practice fields a players’ health center living quarters and an amphitheater. Baker wanted the Village to host the NFL Draft.

And he said it would all be done before the NFL’s centennial in 2020.

That wasn’t to be. The stadium alone cost $150 million – way too much according to accountants familiar with the project. Though it “opened” in 2017 (the old Fawcett Stadium was completely refurbished on the same spot) there was still work to be done in one of the end zones. Stadium and hotel construction halted by fall 2017 because workers weren’t being paid. Liens were filed. Baker and his partners even discussed the possibility of raising the local sales tax to pay for the Village but county commissioners told them a tax increase wasn’t happening.

Cost estimates to complete the Village soared north of $800 million.

“David definitely gets credit for the original vision” Desrosiers said. “It took somebody like David to come in and dream big and help other people to dream big. But it just wasn’t going to work. Financially under the original idea the original strategy just was not going to raise the capital needed to get it done.”

Investors and developers most notably Stu Lichter of Los Angeles-based Industrial Realty Group decided to take the Village out of the Hall of Fame’s hands (which meant out of Baker’s hands) and form a separate entity to finish the project. Crawford was hired in December 2018. Baker ultimately retired as the Hall of Fame’s chief executive last year.

“There was a stadium that was 80 percent complete and a sports complex that was 70 percent complete” Crawford said. “It was really just fields a lot of homes a lot of weeds. I just think there was a slightly over-ambitious view of how much we were going to build all at the same time. And we had to sort of dial that back and get people to understand that they should always want to be building — that’s what keeps people coming back over and over.

“Walt’s favorite saying was ‘Disneyland will never be finished’ and it’s not every year they show something” Crawford continued. “So it can be the same here.”

Crawford negotiated with investors to defer the repayment of loans. He asked subcontractors for patience and completed a merger with Gordon Pointe Acquisition Group a financing engine that took the new company public in 2020 (it’s traded on Nasdaq as Hall of Fame Resort & Entertainment Company or HOFV).

The Village paid $30 million to refurbish the old McKinley Grand hotel downtown which was easier — and cheaper — than building a new hotel from scratch while trying to finish the fields and indoor facility for youth tournaments. The downtown property is now a DoubleTree. A second hotel to be operated by Hilton is scheduled to open sometime in 2023 as is the waterpark.

Shula’s steakhouse and BrewKettle sports bar — complete with an indoor golf simulator provided by Top Golf — are expected to open this year. Hall of Famer Isaac Bruce is opening a Smush Cookies franchise. A Build-A-Bear workshop where fans can build bears licensed by their favorite NFL teams is going in too. The Village has a media company making documentaries about football Hall of Famers.

Last month Canton hosted the USFL and the Women’s Football Alliance playoffs. Last year it was the site of the NCAA Division III National Championship. Rock legends Journey will play at Tom Benson Stadium Saturday as part of Hall of Fame Weekend. Village officials claim they will make $126 million in annual revenues by 2026.

“I think of this place more as a regional destination centered around an iconic sport – pro football” Crawford said. “The comparisons to Disney it’s a fun thing to do but I also think because we’ve created experiences little mini-experiences that can sort of act as rides or shows or events and I think we’ve done a good job at building an event slate that really is pretty powerful.

“We don’t have a gate around us. We’re not charging you dollars to get in. We’re trying to allow people to come in and experience the destination as they want to experience.”

Despite its momentum the Village is still facing its share of trouble.

Why would the title sponsor want to quit? Why are investors so cold?

Last month the Village received another $50 million in loans and financing including a $10 million loan from Lichter (the general contractor and majority owner of the Village) that’s due in September. Lichter who declined comment to The Athletic has contributed many millions to the project including a $22.8 million loan he extended until 2024.

Crawford has a term for the loans that keep construction going – “just-in-time financing.” He says it was the only way to finish the Village when a global pandemic dried up financing and the market for construction materials.

On the matter of Johnson Controls wanting its name taken off the project Crawford said “they were told one thing when they joined and this was pretty new and then it took more time to materialize. Now unfortunately it’s materializing and they’re I think trying to step aside a little too soon. We’ll resolve that conflict.” A spokesman for Johnson Controls declined comment.

Crawford said the Village would do what it took to avoid being booted from the Nasdaq from filing an extension to executing a reverse stock split which would raise the overall price of the stock but hurt investors. Another way to raise the stock price would be to get in on the now-legal Ohio sports-betting market which would be worth millions in annual revenues.

There are dozens of licenses available from the Ohio Casino Control Commission with preference given to pro sports franchises. The Village filed to run a brick-and-mortar sportsbook and an online book but filing an application does not mean a license will be guaranteed.

“A lot of these conversations I’ve been having it seems that folks think that if they submitted an application they have a right to the license without understanding that the General Assembly has had a lot to say about whether someone should have the privilege of a license” Casino Control Commission executive director Matt Schuler said at a recent public meeting.

In the meantime the Village has earned the cautious support of Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine. Developers say they have “constant access” to DeWine’s staff which is working to help procure tax credits once the Village creates a certain number of jobs. Ohio lawmakers set aside $2 million in the state budget to help Village construction.

The NFL likes the progress in Canton too and has pledged $10 million but that money hasn’t come through yet. There is a belief locally that the league wants to see the Village project bear more fruit before paying into it. The Pro Football Hall of Fame meanwhile hopes the Village will boost museum attendance. Plans are underway to build admission packages tied to staying at the Village’s hotels and visiting its other attractions.

“This is a cynical community a community that’s been punched in the stomach a lot” said Desrosiers the Hall’s spokesman who worked for years as sports editor of the Canton Repository. “Factories closing auto plants closing steel mills closing if not closing then at least downsizing dramatically.

“I don’t think anybody in this building ever lost their optimism but it required some regrouping” he continued. “It required some people stepping forward and taking additional risk than maybe they thought they might have to originally. But at each turn the thing that needed to happen has happened.”

Good thing as the future of Hall of Fame Weekend in Canton was riding on it.

CANTON Ohio — On Aug. 6 in Canton the Pro Football Hall of Fame will officially welcome the newest members of its hallowed halls.

Eight men will be inducted for their contributions to what has become known as America's Game all receiving busts forever immortalizing their likenesses in history. From hulking linemen to slick receivers and even coaches and officials all facets of the NFL will be well-represented.

Let's take a closer look at the Class of 2022.

Tony Boselli – OT

Jacksonville Jaguars 1995-2001

One of the most dominant blindside blockers of his day Boselli anchored the Jags' line from the franchise's founding and helped them reach two AFC Championship Games. A five-time Pro Bowler and three-time first-team All-Pro his career was cut short by a devastating shoulder injury and his lack of longevity was the only reason the Hall didn't come calling until his 15th year of eligibility.

Cliff Branch – WR

Oakland/Los Angeles Raiders 1972-85

This year's Seniors Committee inductee Branch is one of a proud few to play for all three of the Raiders' Super Bowl champions leading the league in receiving yards per game and touchdown catches twice each in the process. The three-time first-team All-Pro finished his career with 8685 yards (17.3 per reception) and 67 TDs but sadly did not live to see his enshrinement. He died in 2019 at the age of 71.

LeRoy Butler – DB

Green Bay Packers 1990-2001

Butler began his career at cornerback before moving over to strong safety a position he held down in Green Bay for the next decade. The four-time first-team All-Pro not only picked off 38 passed in his career but also recorded 889 projected tackles (breaking the century mark twice) and 20 1/2 sacks. He helped the Packers to two NFC titles and a Super Bowl victory in 1996.

Art McNally – Official

1959-90 1996-2015

McNally's time in football started as a field judge and referee before being named as the NFL's supervisor of officials in 1968. During his tenure as supervisor and later director he helped implement the league's first instant replay system as well as the use of video technology to evaluate officiating performance. Following a brief stint in the ill-fated World Football League he returned to the NFL as an advisor before finally retiring in 2015 at the age of 90.

Sam Mills – LB

New Orleans Saints 1986-94; Carolina Panthers 1995-97

Finally elected in his last year of eligibility on the Modern Era ballot Mills was a five-time Pro Bowler and three-time All-Pro who tallied at least 100 tackles seven times. After guiding the Saints to their first playoff appearances in franchise history he moved on to the expansion Panthers who made it to the NFC Championship game in just their second year of existence. Mills went straight from retirement to coaching Carolina's linebackers and was still in that position when he died of cancer in 2005 at the age of just 46.

Richard Seymour – DL

New England Patriots 2001-08; Oakland Raiders 2009-12

Throughout the 2000s few defensive linemen were as skilled and as versatile as Seymour who made seven Pro Bowls and five All-Pro teams as both an end and a tackle. Besides his 91 tackles for loss and 57 1/2 career sacks he even deflected 39 passes (including 10 in 2003) as he anchored a Pats defense that won three Super Bowls in four years.

Dick Vermeil – Head coach

Philadelphia Eagles 1976-82; St. Louis Rams 1997-99; Kansas City Chiefs 2001-05

One of the most respected figures ever to grace an NFL sideline Vermeil left UCLA to take over the moribund Eagles and had them in the Super Bowl by his fifth season. A 15-year retirement for the relatively young coach followed before his next reclamation project came in St. Louis where his steady hand developed the Rams from 4-12 to the ""Greatest Show on Turf"" and a world championship in 1999. A second brief retirement preceded his final stop in KC where he won one last divisional title to finish his unique career with 126 total victories and six playoff appearances.

Bryant Young – DL

“Financial health isn’t always associated with more income ...” noted Kim Avilez the borough’s first JP Morgan Chase community manager who has worked in financial services for more than 20 years. “Getting the right education is important to understanding how to utilize money and watch your finances grow. That’s why it’s so important to collaborate with neighborhood leaders and organizations to break down economic barriers and support the success of our customers and our community.”

Serving as a local ambassador for JPMorgan Chase Avilez will build and nurture relationships with Staten Island residents community leaders real estate agents and non-profit organizations. In collaboration with these groups Avilez will host regular workshops -- free of charge and open to the public -- that focus on a wide range of topics like building a budget saving for a down payment and credit health while finding the right products and services to support individuals’ financial health goals.

Beyond this new leadership role for the firm on Staten Island JPMorgan Chase is investing $6 million of equity in minority depository institutions and community development financial institutions around the country including New York-based Carver Federal Savings Bank.

Carver expects to utilize most of the proceeds from JPMorgan Chase’s investment to increase lending activities to minority and women business entrepreneurs and expand financial education programs in the diverse low-to-moderate income communities it serves.

“With 158 employees 12 branches and more than $7 million in philanthropic investments over the past year throughout the city Staten Island is critical to the success of JPMorgan Chase” said Sekou Kaalund head of JPMorgan Chase’s northeast division of consumer banking. “We’re bringing in local leaders who know these communities inside and out and are committed to empowering everyone ... to take charge of their financial future and succeed.”

The ""Blink"" and ""Outliers"" author told the host Steven Bartlett that people should return to the office to regain a ""sense of belonging.""

""It’s very hard to feel necessary when you’re physically disconnected"" Gladwell said. ""As we face the battle that all organizations are facing now in getting people back into the office it’s really hard to explain this core psychological truth which is we want you to have a feeling of belonging and to feel necessary.""

Gladwell acknowledged the hassle of coming to the office but insisted it was not in employees’ best interest to work from home.

""[I]f you’re just sitting in your pajamas in your bedroom is that the work life you want to live?"" Gladwell asked. ""Don’t you want to feel part of something?""

Gladwell said he was frustrated with the inability of people in positions of leadership to effectively communicate to their employees the importance of returning to the office.

""If we don’t feel like we’re part of something important what’s the point?"" he said. ""If it’s just a paycheck then it’s like what have you reduced your life to?""

A growing segment of the population has become accustomed to working from home since the new arrangement was first tried out on a grand scale during the COVID-19 pandemic. Now according to some estimates a majority of U.S. workers have cited remote work as a major factor in their job consideration.

Data from Employ Inc. in April found that 65% of workers said that remote work or work-from-home (WFH) options impacted their decision to accept or reject a job offer. As many as 40% of respondents said they would take lower pay if it meant working remotely.

Some employers have allowed their employees to continue working from home indefinitely while others have adopted hybrid models.

Others like Tesla CEO Elon Musk have been more assertive. Earlier this year Musk told employees that they must put in a minimum of 40 hours per week at the office if they also wish to do remote work."

На 7 април 2018 г. Карл-Ериван Хауб управляващ съдружник на Tengelmann Group изчезва по време на ски алпинизъм в Цермат. След инцидента между членовете на семество Хауб се разгаря спор за наследство. Причината: данък върху наследството в размер на 450 милиона евро. Една трета от групата за търговия на дребно отива при децата му - близнаците Виктория и Ериван и при вдовицата му Катрин когато Хауб е обявен за мъртъв през 2021 г. Обикновено компанията би поела данъчната тежест вместо тях. Но братята на Хауб - Кристиан и Георг се противопоставят и искат да принудят роднините си да продадат дела. Успешно: за да могат да платят данъка върху наследството близнаците и майка им продават дяловете си на Кристиан Хауб.

Дори и богатите невинаги успяват да гарантират че децата им ще ги наследят по данъчно ефективен начин. И все пак те имат съвсем различни възможности от тези на средностатистическите служители. Например създаване на фондация. Желателен страничен ефект: потомците са осигурени но не могат да пропилеят наследството.

13 деца две фондации

Вероятно с тази цел патриархът на автомобилната индустрия Фердинанд Пиех създава своите фондации Ferdinand Karl Alpha и Ferdinand Karl Beta в които внася своето състояние за милиарди евро пише WirtschaftsWoche. Когато той умира през 2019 г. на 82-годишна възраст вдовицата му Урсула оглавява фондациите. Въпреки това тя може да прави каквото си иска там само ако не се омъжи повторно. А самият Фердинад Пиех има 13 деца от четири съпруги.

Нищо чудно че след смъртта му избухват спорове. Няколко противоречиви завещания и липсващи ценности - включително колекция от самурайски мечове - предизвикват размирици. Без фондациите предаването на милиардното богатство вероятно щеше да бъде още по-спорно. И по-скъпо.

Всичко в холдинга

Корените на богатството за милирди на семейство Райман се крият в химическата компания Reckitt Benckiser. В продължение на много години обаче средствата се управляват от JAB Holding. Чрез холдинга парите на семейството което е едно от най-богатите в Германия са инвестирани в множество компании сред които производителят на напитки Keurig Dr Pepper и компанията за кетъринг Pret A Manger. Четирите семейства от династията Райман притежават лъвския пай от JAB.

Досега споровете за наследство се предотвратяваха чрез конструкцията на холдинга. Вероятно – за угода на семейството чиито членове избягват светлините на прожекторите и са почти непознати за обществеността. Една съдебна кал между десетте деца на Рейман не би се вписала в имиджа на фамилията.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Tom Miller a resident of the city made it his duty to restore the dull pink fire hydrants to a new bright red.

“I’m up to a hundred hydrants so far and just having fun doing it and making things nice in the city… and that’s the key… is to do something nice” said Miller.

He began the summer of 2020 all because he wanted to do something good for the city.

“I was thinking of things to do that’s nice for Menasha. My dad was a former fire chief from 1979 to 1994. My wife’s dad was a fire chief at Kimberly Clark” said Miller.

The good deed he chose was painting the fire hydrants. He goes out on free mornings and paints four or five a day.

The first summer he painted nine in Downtown Menasha the second summer he painted about 40 and this summer he’s painting the fire hydrants on Doty Island. He’s up to 45 this summer alone.

The city purchases the paint for him and he volunteers his time to keep his city beautiful. Miller has painted over 100 fire hydrants so far but he doesn’t plan on stopping anytime soon.

“Not likely to stop anytime soon because by the time I stop and get everything done over on the other side of Menasha... I’ll end up having to redo what I started three years ago so it’s just nonstop” said Miller.

He cares about the city he calls home and wants to make sure it remains as beautiful as he knows it to be.

“One small step at a time I’m trying to make it look nice” said Miller.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8wNi9idXNpbmVzcy9jb3N0Y28ta2lya2xhbmQtc2lnbmF0dXJlLXRyYWRlci1qb2VzLXN0b3JlLWJyYW5kcy9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFeaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8wOC8wNi9idXNpbmVzcy9jb3N0Y28ta2lya2xhbmQtc2lnbmF0dXJlLXRyYWRlci1qb2VzLXN0b3JlLWJyYW5kcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The hidden makers of Costco's Kirkland Signature and Trader Joe's O's,"New York CNN Business —

Kirkland Signature. Two-Buck Chuck. Simple Truth. Cat & Jack. Great Value. Amazon Basics. Store brands have never been more popular.

They have become forces in their own right and make up around 21% of sales in the $1.17 trillion US grocery industry according to IRI.

As prices surge store brands – also known as private labels white labels or generic brands – have become an even more attractive option for inflation-fatigued shoppers who are looking to switch from pricier name brands. Store brands can be anywhere from 10% to 50% cheaper.

But the origins of store brands remain largely secretive.

Retailers aren’t typically forthcoming about the companies that make their brands. And manufacturers likewise have little incentive to reveal that they’re creating similar products to their name brands under a different label sold on the cheap.

Many leading national brand manufacturers create private labels for multiple retailers. In the late 1990s more than half of brand manufacturers were estimated to make private goods as well.

Although store brands ostensibly compete with manufacturers’ national brands manufacturers often have excess capacity on their production lines. To generate additional profit some will use that extra capacity to make private labels.

Other brand manufacturers will produce private labels as an incentive for retailers hoping they’ll be rewarded with better shelf space and placement for their own national labels.

“Most manufacturers aren’t open about it” said Jan-Benedict E.M. Steenkamp a marketing professor at the University of North Carolina who studies private labels and branding. “Manufacturers don’t want it to be known because it undermines the power of their own brands.”

But there are some exceptions. Kimberly-Clark (KMB) the maker of Huggies diapers produces Kirkland Signature diapers for Costco (COST)and Duracell produces Kirkland Signature batteries Costco (COST)executives have said.

Georgia-Pacific the maker of Brawny and Dixie also produces store brands. So does Henkel (HENKY) the manufacturer of Purex and Dial.

Eight O’Clock Coffee and Kenmore

Store labels have been around since the early days of retail and the emergence of consumer brands in the 19th century.

Macy’s sold stoneware whiskey jugs under its own name. Customers could bring back the jugs for refills according to Christopher Durham the president of the Velocity Institute a trade association for private brands.

Montgomery Ward developed its own line of aspirin in wooden containers while the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. (aka A&P) sold branded spices with the slogan “Take the Grandmother’s Advice Use A&P Spices.” A&P later developed Eight O’Clock Coffee one of the most famous private labels of the period.

Yet no US retailer was more successful developing its own brands than Sears Roebuck.

In 1925 Sears created the Allstate brand for car tires. A few years later Sears launched its first Craftsman wrench according to Durham. Its Kenmore line which started as a sewing machine brand in 1913 before branching into vacuums and other home appliances became the leading home appliance brand in the United States.

These private labels were the exception however.

For most of the 20th century national brands such as Jell-O H.J. Heinz Campbell Soup (CPB) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) had power over stores. These manufacturers flooded the airwaves and newspapers with advertisements extolling the advantages of their products.

Most customers were fiercely loyal to specific brands not retailers. A store that didn’t carry major labels would likely get crushed which gave manufacturers immense leverage.

Additionally many store brands were also considered dull cheap knockoffs of national brands.

The low point of private label came during the 1970s Durham said when stores seeking to cut costs and rolled out generics with basic white backgrounds and black letters identifying the product – beer soap cola beans and other staples.

Shopper loyalty

Retailers make private label brands for a variety of reasons including to boost profitability and sometimes as a negotiating tool against brands.

Private brands often carry profit margins that are 20% to 40% higher than national brands because stores don’t have to pay the advertising distribution or other markup costs that are embedded in major brands’ prices.

In the mid-20th century many retailers started to develop their own labels to claw back bargaining power from dominant suppliers and keep their prices in check. As the US retail industry has consolidated in recent decades the power dynamic between retailers and suppliers reversed. Now stores have more leverage to introduce their own labels – whether name brands like it or not.

“Forty years ago Walmart pissing off P&G would be a risky situation. Now Walmart is much bigger than P&G” said Steenkamp the marketing professor.

Today stores’ private brand operations are more sophisticated than ever and a much bigger focus for chains.

Stores are likelier these days to develop a distinctive private brand or product to stand out against competitors and create shopper loyalty said Krishnakumar Davey the president of client engagement at IRI.

Costco (COST) for example will decide to make a Kirkland Signature product because a leading brand won’t sell to the retailer. Or Costco (COST) believes the name brand’s prices have gotten too high and it can make its own similar-quality product and sell it for 20% less.

Costco hasn’t lost any relationships with suppliers by launching its own Kirkland products but those brands are not usually pleased when Costco introduces one company CFO Richard Galanti said in an interview earlier this year.

Retailers have been sued for creating products that too closely resemble national brands. The owner of golf ball-brand Titleist sued Costco for patent infringement while Williams-Sonoma (WSM) sued Amazon (AMZN) for selling “knockoffs” under its own brand. Both cases were settled.

The US House Judiciary Committee and other lawmakers and regulators around the world have investigated whether Amazon uses data from sellers to create its own brands and unlawfully favors its own brands on its website.

Amazon has said it doesn’t use the data from individual third-party sellers to inform the development of its own private brands and does not favor its own products on the site.

Most stores start small with their own brands. Grocers for example will often first introduce a shelf-stable product like pasta flour sugar or rice that’s easier to make and where brand loyalty within the category isn’t strong.

“You don’t start with the most difficult things” Steenkamp said. “As stores build more experience and success then they enter new categories.”

How to find out who makes store brands

So how do you tell who’s behind your favorite store brands?

Product recalls are often the most revealing way to find out which brand manufacturers are behind specific private labels.

Last year for example Dole recalled fresh salads and vegetables including private brands for Walmart Kroger and H-E-B.

J.M. Smucker (SJM) recalled certain Jif peanut butter products this year as well as store-branded items it made for Giant Eagle Wawa and Safeway. Large companies such as Conagra and McCain Foods have recalled products from Trader Joe’s.

Then there are the dedicated private label manufacturers such as Treehouse Foods (THS) which makes snacks under the labels of supermarkets big-box chains and other retailers. Nearly one-quarter of the company’s $4.3 billion in sales last year for example came from Walmart (WMT).

James Walser who led the launch of Target’s (TGT) up & up household basics and personal care brand in 2009 said that Target tried to move away from national brand manufacturers during up & up’s development to nimbler suppliers focused solely on making private labels.

Some large retailers also make their own private labels. Kroger for example makes about 30% of its own private products.

Perhaps the strangest store brand manufacturers are retailers that make private brands for their…competitors: Safeway-owned Lucerne Foods manufactures private labels for Safeway’s rivals.

Super Bowl XXXI was a wrap and the Green Bay Packers were once again on top of the NFL after – well it seemed like 200 years.

The Packers’ locker room was mostly empty by now though one figure certainly stood out. Standing near the middle was LeRoy Butler still wearing the bottom of his game-day jersey and a sweat-stained t-shirt. Aside from the wall-to-wall smile he was wearing you couldn’t help but notice how he was holding the Super Bowl trophy; both arms wrapped around it and holding it high and tight to his chest.

So naturally he was asked what was going through his mind after the 35-21 victory over the New England Patriots at the Superdome in New Orleans.

And why was he holding onto to that trophy like it was his first born?

""When I was first here in 1990 we were 4-12 with eight consecutive losses’’ said Butler. “I was very jealous of guys around the league that won the championship. Now I know what it feels like. My man Chris Jacke and me are the only two left. It's very sweet for him and me.

""I mean it feels great. I can't describe it. I was telling my kids all week look daddy's coming home with that trophy regardless. I don't care if we have to steal it. We're going to do whatever it takes. It's good not to be a liar to your kids.”

Butler was doing his best to hold in his emotions at this point as so many thoughts and memories were rushing around in his head.

""I'm trying not to cry’’ he said. “But all week me and (running back) Edgar (Bennett) sitting in our room and we couldn't envision. We said it was just too good to be true to be here. Way back when we were in Jacksonville as little kids we were watching the Super Bowl and that meant a lot to us.

""And way back a long time ago when I was still in a wheelchair my mom said 'Hey you'll be there.' And you know to finally get here means a lot to me. It's just so hard to describe it. It just feels so much to me. That's it.""

And with that Butler wiped away a tear from his eye turned and headed to his locker.

Founded in a tiny back-office in Stockholm by three young postgraduates in 2005 it had attracted funding from US VC heavyweight Sequoia by 2010.

Fast forward 11 years to March last year when it raised $1bn at a $31bn valuation becoming Europe’s most valuable startup. Three months later it raised another $639m bumping its valuation up again to $45bn and securing it the title of the world’s second most valuable fintech after Stripe (last valued at $95bn).

But last month the tide changed for the BNPL giant as a dramatic down round saw Klarna's valuation cut to $6.7bn — an 85% drop from a year earlier.

As Europe’s former most valuable startup Klarna is a good touch point for the general health of the European startup ecosystem. It’s certainly got us thinking who could be next in the down round line.



So how exactly did this happen? We’ve pieced together a timeline of Klarna’s recent valuation history to give you a better idea of the story so far.

Klarna's valuation history: explained

September 2020 — Klarna valuation hits $11bn as startup becomes the fourth most valuable fintech in the world

In September 2020 Klarna's valuation more than doubled to $10.6bn when it raised $650m from Silver Lake Partners BlackRock GIC and Hmi capital.

At the time investors rushed to defend its new price tag. Hans Otterling partner at Northzone told the Swedish press that this was a bargain compared to fintechs like Paypal or AfterPay given how fast Klarna was growing.

“I would say that it is actually a low valuation of the company” he said.

At that point talk of an IPO within one or two years for Klarna was circulating. So Sifted took a look at the growth in revenue multiples that the company would need in order to justify its new valuation on exit day as well as the sticking power of consumers’ new desire for the BNPL checkout option and its chances in the US.

October 2020 — success breeds the next gen of entrepreneurs

As Klarna’s workforce grew so too did its alumni of “Klarnauts”: by the time it was 15 years old it had bred a significant group of top-class engineers and managers who went on to found their own startups.

Occasionally they even received financial support from their former colleagues — including from Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski.

From Lena Hackelöer’s journey from heading up marketing at Klarna to founding her own fintech Brite Payments to Kristofer Ekman Sinclair’s transition from business development to developing his own payments startup Zimpler we profiled the cream of the crop here.

March 2021 — valuation hits $31bn making Klarna Europe’s most valuable startup

Across 2020 Klarna’s revenue increased 40% to $1bn. This Covid-fuelled growth was enough to convince a glittering lineup of new and existing investors to pour $1bn into the company in March 2021.

The round made Klarna Europe’s most valuable startup and the second most valuable fintech worldwide.

Atomico Northzone Permira Silver Lake Partners Technology Crossover Ventures Sequoia Capital BlackRock Bestseller Dragoneer Investment Group GIC Ant Group Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Hmi Capital all backed Klarna in the round. The fundraise tripled Klarna’s valuation to $31bn.

But it’s worth noting that despite 2020’s revenue increases Klarna’s losses also accelerated 50% that year due to expansion costs. Its net losses came in at around $109m that year too.

June 2021 — Klarna hits $45.6bn valuation and becomes the world’s second most valuable fintech

It’s a wonder how the Klarna exec team managed to pause to catch their breath last year amid all the fundraising activity: just three months later the company scored another $639m in fresh capital at a $45.6bn post-money valuation.

SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2 led the round which gave Klarna the crown of second most valuable fintech startup in the world — second only to Stripe.



The new valuation represented a 330% valuation increase from the company’s $10.6m valuation just nine months earlier. Klarna said it was going to use the money to push on with its rapid expansion into the US.

The deal also sent Klarna’s share price soaring — and made over 75 of its employees paper millionaires according to a Sifted analysis of the company’s shareholder book.

May 2022 — the tech downturn starts to bite as Klarna lays off 10% of its team amid rumours of an imminent valuation crunch

After going *relatively* quiet on the fundraising front for almost a year Siemiatkowski sent shockwaves through the European startup ecosystem when he announced that the company was laying off 10% of its staff in May 2022.

LinkedIn data showed the company had 6500 employees at the time — so the layoffs affected as many as 650 staff.

In a prerecorded video message shared with employees Siemiatkowski said that the layoffs were mainly due to market constraints which spurred a business plan rethink.

“We are strongly influenced by the outside world. When we set our goals for 2022 in the autumn it was a very different world than the one we have today” he said.

Amid the global market downturn Siemiatkowski told staff that the company needed to focus on its core business.

“That is why we need to act. More than ever we need to show laser focus on what really makes us successful in the future” he said.

Klarna offered severance pay and voluntary redundancy to staff. According to a Sifted analysis talent acquisition engineering and business development were among the departments most hit by the layoffs — and most of the employees affected were based at the company’s HQ in Stockholm.



May 2022 — Amid Klarna valuation crunch rumours can the BNPL business model hold up in a recession?

In the background of the layoffs announcement Sifted noticed that Klarna had also quietly announced that pre-tax losses tripled to $250m in the first three months of the year up from $80m in the same period last year.

That’s quite a big jump considering the amount of equity that had been flowing into the startup from investors.

It showed that as banks and economists grappled with the possibility of an economic downturn even Europe’s most valuable startup was not immune to macroeconomic turmoil.

Fintech investors’ darling innovation of the past decade BNPL is exposed to both interest rates hikes and the effects of inflation on consumer spend.

We got into why this could make investors nervous about lofty valuations and how it could narrow margins for Klarna and its competitors here.

June 2022 — company is said to be facing a valuation slash to $15bn as it seeks fresh round of funding

Talk of a Klarna down round intensified in June. Sources close to the matter told the Wall Street Journal that the company was attempting to raise at a third of its previous valuation.

Its valuation was said to be on course to shrink to $15bn a result of ongoing talks with investors to raise at least $500m according to reports at the time.

Klarna would not confirm the talks or these numbers with Sifted. A spokesperson for Klarna told Sifted that the reports were “pure speculation and we do not comment on fundraising nor valuation speculation”.



July 2022 — Klarna’s valuation is slashed to $6.7bn in fresh funding round

Just a month after Klarna dismissed talks of a down round the company announced it had raised a new $800m funding round that cut its valuation to $6.7bn knocking it off top spot as Europe’s most valuable fintech. That’s an 85% drop from the valuation it had held for the previous 12 months.

The round featured existing investors including Sequoia Bestseller and Silver Lake as well as new investors like the UAE’s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.

In a statement announcing the fresh funding Klarna justified its revised valuation by pegging itself against its peers.

“Klarna has not been immune to the significant downdrafts of fintech stock in public markets” the statement said.

“The company’s peers are down 80 to 90% vs peak valuations and consequently the adjustment in Klarna’s valuation is on par with its public peers from its $45.6bn valuation in June 2021.”

Meanwhile Sequoia which has backed Klarna since 2010 attributed the revised valuation to fluctuating investor sentiment.

“The shift in Klarna’s valuation is entirely due to investors suddenly voting in the opposite manner to the way they voted for the past few years” said Michael Moritz partner at Sequoia.

“The irony is that Klarna’s business its position in various markets and its popularity with consumers and merchants are all stronger than at any time since Sequoia first invested in 2010. Eventually after investors emerge from their bunkers the stocks of Klarna and other first-rate companies will receive the attention they deserve”.

Sifted’s take

Klarna’s recent down round is a sharp turn of fate that serves as a reminder to founders and investors of just how quickly market conditions can change.

Klarna has had something of a monopoly in Europe in recent years. This manifested in considerable revenue growth when the pandemic hit the continent and online shopping boomed. Investors got excited and bet big on BNPL’s continued growth. Of course consumers would keep flocking to this new checkout option which allowed them to pay for items in interest-free instalments rather than immediately at the point of sale. Cue Softbank getting in on the deal and the massive valuation uptick that came with it last summer.

But all this time as it chased growth and took on the US the company’s losses were widening. This is by no means unusual in the fintech space but it did leave the company vulnerable to a valuation reassessment from investors this summer. It’s clear VCs still believe in Klarna’s long-term growth potential but they’ll naturally be looking to minimise their risk. As with any startup looking to extend its runway via fresh funding right now Klarna put itself up for a “mark to market"".

Public tech stocks are down and the main risks to Klarna’s business model — rising interest rates and falling consumer spending — are up. This shaved millions off the price tag that investors were willing to give it.

Siemiatkowski has been clear about Klarna’s renewed focus on its core business — the layoffs and down round are uncomfortable announcements to make in the short-term but give the company a chance for a “reset” in the long term. All eyes will be on how long it can make its fresh $800m of capital last.

Stores are likelier these days to develop a distinctive private brand or product to stand out against competitors and create shopper loyalty said Krishnakumar Davey the president of client engagement at IRI.

Costco (COST) for example will decide to make a Kirkland Signature product because a leading brand won’t sell to the retailer. Or Costco (COST) believes the name brand’s prices have gotten too high and it can make its own similar-quality product and sell it for 20% less.

Costco hasn’t lost any relationships with suppliers by launching its own Kirkland products but those brands are not usually pleased when Costco introduces one company CFO Richard Galanti said in an interview earlier this year.

Retailers have been sued for creating products that too closely resemble national brands. The owner of golf ball-brand Titleist sued Costco for patent infringement while Williams-Sonoma (WSM) sued Amazon (AMZN) for selling “knockoffs” under its own brand. Both cases were settled.

The US House Judiciary Committee and other lawmakers and regulators around the world have investigated whether Amazon uses data from sellers to create its own brands and unlawfully favors its own brands on its website.

Amazon has said it doesn’t use the data from individual third-party sellers to inform the development of its own private brands and does not favor its own products on the site.

Most stores start small with their own brands. Grocers for example will often first introduce a shelf-stable product like pasta flour sugar or rice that’s easier to make and where brand loyalty within the category isn’t strong.

“You don’t start with the most difficult things” Steenkamp said. “As stores build more experience and success then they enter new categories.”

How to find out who makes store brands

So how do you tell who’s behind your favorite store brands?

Product recalls are often the most revealing way to find out which brand manufacturers are behind specific private labels.

Last year for example Dole recalled fresh salads and vegetables including private brands for Walmart Kroger and H-E-B.

J.M. Smucker (SJM) recalled certain Jif peanut butter products this year as well as store-branded items it made for Giant Eagle Wawa and Safeway. Large companies such as Conagra and McCain Foods have recalled products from Trader Joe’s.

Then there are the dedicated private label manufacturers such as Treehouse Foods (THS) which makes snacks under the labels of supermarkets big-box chains and other retailers. Nearly one-quarter of the company’s $4.3 billion in sales last year for example came from Walmart (WMT).

Target has dozens of its own brands such as Cat & Jack Universal Thread and up & up. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

James Walser who led the launch of Target’s (TGT) up & up household basics and personal care brand in 2009 said that Target tried to move away from national brand manufacturers during up & up’s development to nimbler suppliers focused solely on making private labels.

Some large retailers also make their own private labels. Kroger for example makes about 30% of its own private products.

Perhaps the strangest store brand manufacturers are retailers that make private brands for their…competitors: Safeway-owned Lucerne Foods manufactures private labels for Safeway’s rivals.

Many Americans have grown up eating deli meats. Ham sandwiches pepperoni on pizza and fried bologna have long been familiar fare to families from coast to coast. And most were blissfully unaware that they should be leery of their processed meats — no matter how convenient and tasty they were.

Fast forward to the 2010s and 2020s eras in which the general public has become keenly aware of the dangers lurking behind their supermarket deli counters. While that slice of lunch meat might look benign Consumer Reports warns that the regular consumption of cold cuts (even in small amounts) raises your chances of getting cancer. Plus who can forget all the times that processed meats have been recalled due to fears of listeria?

Even if your honey-baked ham hasn't been recalled the Mayo Clinic warns that those who are pregnant and people with compromised immune systems should be extra cautious when it comes to deli meats. ABC News adds that a joint research project by the FDA CDC and USDA determined that cold cuts are ""high risk"" for transmitting listeriosis partially because this bacteria loves refrigerator temperatures. Apparently we should also be afraid of the meat slicer. According to the FDA these tools can be hard to sanitize resulting in several outbreaks of foodborne sicknesses and hospitalizations. That meaty sandwich probably doesn't look so good now does it?

Armed Overwatch

If you’ve read this far you’re probably wondering what “Armed Overwatch” is all about. I’ll explain. Back in the days of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom we discovered a need for a manned surveillance/close air support aircraft (CAS) that could operate out of isolated rugged terrain. A-10s are great but they will not be taking off or landing from smallish bumpy fields. So in addition to its surveillance role we (“we” being US ground forces) wanted an agile aircraft capable of executing limited-scale airstrikes during counterinsurgency (COIN) operations.

The “powers that be” at SOCOM lobbied for an armed reconnaissance aircraft (for many years) and eventually the Armed Overwatch program was born. Our friends at Popular Science have reported on this and note that “Armed Overwatch” was the program’s name that led to the design and construction of the Sky Warden. If you like reading in detail how your tax dollars are being spent here is a link to the federal government’s announcement regarding the program’s funding.

Here is a brief summary for those who don’t like that much detail:

The August 1st announcement states that the program “will provide Special Operations Forces deployable affordable and sustainable crewed aircraft systems fulfilling close air support precision strike and armed intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance requirements in austere and permissive environments for use in irregular warfare operations in support of the National Defense Strategy.”

Here is an excellent five-minute video from Ed Nash’s Military Matters featuring footage of the new Sky Warden in flight. As you’ll see the cockpit(s) look more like they belong to a fighter than a converted crop duster.

What Not A Drone?

I’ve waited until the end to answer the question many of you must be thinking. That is “Why don’t use just use a drone instead?” That’s a fair question; on paper some drones perform many of the same functions as the Sky Warden without endangering a pilot.

The operator on the ground wants a set of human eyes in the air looking at the same thing he is. He wants to talk to that pilot about the situation in front of them and have the confidence that when deemed necessary the trigger will be pulled and the weapons deployed on the right target at the right time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3R1bHNhd29ybGQuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvY29tcGFueS1idWlsZGluZy11bmlxdWUtbWlsaXRhcnktcGxhbmVzLWluLXR1bHNhLWZvci1zcGVjaWFsLWZvcmNlcy1taXNzaW9ucy9hcnRpY2xlXzU0ZDU2OWEyLTEyN2QtMTFlZC1iODM5LWFiYjY2NDI5ZTMwMi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Company building unique military planes in Tulsa for special forces missions,"Related content Tulsa aerospace company expands facility to produce military aircraft equipment

A multibillion-dollar aerospace and technology company with a Tulsa facility plans to finalize the building and configuration of at least six specialized aircraft for the military here beginning this fall.

With an initial government grant of $170 million L3Harris will equip and make flight-ready at least six AT-802U Sky Warden planes in Tulsa.

The manned single-engine turboprop aircraft is designed for airborne intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance as well as missions in extreme combat environments.

It is designed to perform in austere disaggregated combat environments with limited infrastructure. It has unparalleled range and endurance weapons sensor and communication capabilities the company said.

The contract for now has a cost ceiling of $3 billion.

“I was ecstatic” Luke Savoie president of intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance for L3Harris told the Tulsa World last week when asked about news of the grant. “This is very personal to me.”

Savoie is a former Air Force pilot of the AC-130 gunship and other aircraft and had a large role in designing and developing the Sky Warden platform.

Many of the Sky Warden’s features are proprietary and its capabilities — depending on its individual specifications for the military — are not available publicly Savoie acknowledged.

However he said depending on the aircraft’s sensors a pilot would be able to pinpoint a specific point where an enemy is firing.

“I can look out the window and I can see someone shooting. And I can sit there on the throttle and hit a button and drop a point of where I was looking at. I saw someone shooting a weapon — I drop a point right there” he said.

“And I can go over here and hit another button and the auto-pilot — based on what I was just looking at — will now automatically put the aircraft into orbit around that point.

“I hit another button ... and now the fire control is targeting that position. So I have a sensor looking at it the fire control has updated that — that’s what it should be targeting — and now I can just roll in and put a shot off and engage that and never have had to sit there in tight coordinates or do all these weird mouse clicks and all this other stuff (at a distance with drone military aircraft)” Savoie said.

“It’s fairly tightly integrated and digitally controlled. And that’s the greatest thing about the weapons system is how tightly that all works.”

He declined to say the cost range for each aircraft depending on its specific weapons and sensor configuration but a news release by the company said the Sky Warden is “affordable.”

The plane’s intended use is for close combat support by the Air Force Savoie said but could also potentially be sold to U.S. allies.

“Sky Warden has a demand out there. If you’re a nation state that deals with violent extremists — if you’re either budget constrained or you’re infrastructure constrained or you need things to be multi-role ... this provides options for those potential types of customers” he said.

“I’m honored to be part of this program and provide this capability to customers. We look forward to growing ... and expanding our presence in the state and look forward to supporting the state of Oklahoma” he said.

U.S. Special Operations Command selected L3Harris and Air Tractor Inc.’s Sky Warden system for its Armed Overwatch program.

With an initial program contract award of $170 million the program could include delivery of up to 75 aircraft.

Production of new fully modified Armed Overwatch mission-configured aircraft will begin in 2023 at L3Harris’ Tulsa modification center the company said in a news release following initial production at the Air Tractor Inc.’s Olney Texas aircraft manufacturing facility.

Air Tractor is a manufacturer of aircraft for agricultural firefighting and utility applications. Olney is about 130 miles northwest of Dallas and 40 miles south of Wichita Falls.

In Tulsa since 1974 and at Tulsa International Airport since 2013 L3Harris develops maintains and operates airborne missile tracking systems in support of the Missile Defense Agency Airborne Sensor Program.

The Melbourne Florida-based company is a technology supplier for military government and commercial partners.

L3Harris employs 306 people in Tulsa and with the contract is looking to expand with about 100 new positions including engineers and mechanical and electrical installers Savoie said.

In November the company announced an expansion of operations in Tulsa with plans to create at least 80 new jobs.

“We’ve been a strong supporter of L3 in wanting to put them in a position to be successful by providing world-class facilities for them to do their work just like we do with so many other rapidly growing companies out there at the airport” Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum said at the time.

“This is really in my mind this is one of our greatest opportunities for growth as it relates to Tulsa’s economy. It’s the industrial cluster that we have right here at the airport” Bynum said.

People in the Tulsa area could see the planes flying from Texas to L3Harris’ facility at Tulsa International Airport as soon as this fall Savoie said.

“The Sky Warden design reflects our commitment to America’s national security and the AT-802U will be equipped with everything we’ve learned manufacturing aircraft over the past 46 years” Air Tractor President Jim Hirsch said in a statement.

“The L3Harris team is an excellent partner and our production and engineering staff are ready to immediately deliver this world-class product to our nation’s special forces” Hirsch said.

L3Harris has more than $17 billion in annual revenue and 47000 employees with customers in more than 100 countries according to its website.

“Sky Warden will bring powerful and affordable close air support precision strike armed ISR (intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance) and command and control capabilities directly to special operations forces in the battlefield” Sean Stackley president of integrated mission systems for L3Harris said in a statement.

“Our laser communications solutions can provide order of magnitude higher bandwidth than any radio frequency technologies. This unlocks sheer endless possibilities for inflight entertainment real-time aircraft and turbine monitoring and a range of other crew or passenger services no one is even thinking of today” Mynaric CEO Bulent Altan tells Runway Girl Network.

“Laser-linked aircraft may even double-function as airborne cellphone towers for users on the ground at sea or for other aircraft unlocking new revenue models. The imagination is the limit once Terabit-class connectivity becomes available via laser communications.”

To be clear Mynaric sees IFC for civil aviation as a future opportunity for its technology. “We believe laser communications and the unprecedented speeds and license-free nature that come with it hold tremendous potential for aero ISPs and civil aviation however we are not yet addressing this market today as we expect first adoption in the unmanned aerial vehicle and government market in the airborne domain” explains Altan.

As such Mynaric believes it’s too early to make quantitative estimates or predict a specific architecture for civil aviation.

“However” says Altan “in general we expect to see multi-layered multi-faceted and interconnected networks going forward including network nodes on the ground in air and in space. Very much like the terrestrial Internet we expect to see densely meshed networks going forward connecting everything everywhere.” He continues:

In this scenario laser communications are not expected to replace all existing radio frequency equipment but to rather complement aircraft communication capabilities with very high bandwidth and secure backhaul links to other aircraft the ground or to space.

In October 2021 Mynaric and H3 HATS a subsidiary of H3 Aerospace specializing in high-altitude platforms announced the successful start of a joint demonstration campaign to showcase laser comms capabilities for high-altitude long endurance aircraft using industrialized terminals.

The campaign utilized a setup of two Mynaric-manufactured HAWK products — on the ground and mounted in the fuselage payload bay of a Grob G 520NG aircraft — to demonstrate air-to-ground links. The campaign demonstrated stable bidirectional laser links with speeds of 10 Gbps between the aircraft and the ground terminal during various flight patterns.

“The biggest takeaway so far was the successful demonstration of the world’s first industrialized optical communications terminals for airborne applications” says Altan. “Previous demonstrations relied on one-off prototypes or technology demonstrators. In last year’s demonstrations our commercially available HAWK pre-series products reliably performed as expected and demonstrated stable bidirectional and high-speed optical links in air-to-ground scenarios. These demonstrations pave the way for the operational deployment of laser communications systems to eventually becoming integral to airborne and mobility networks.”

Closing laser communication links in the air is much harder than in space due to the aircraft’s movements and atmospheric conditions. And Mynaric has faced these challenges during the G 520NG demo flights.

“Laser communication in any airborne scenario is subject to signal degradation due to atmospheric turbulences which vary with geography weather altitude and other factors. Further aircraft movements are less predictable than satellite motion. The combination of these factors yields additional complexities which we experienced during these demonstrations” confirms Altan.

“However these circumstances are the nominal conditions to be expected for any dynamic laser communication link from airborne platforms and represent exactly what our airborne product HAWK is built for. We have more than 10 years of experience in building laser communication systems for airborne scenarios and hold to our knowledge the world record of the fastest airborne laser communication link which we initially established in collaboration with Facebook in 2017 ”

Mynaric’s optical communications products also allow for flexibility. For instance some applications will require meshed networks in the air while others will make use of dedicated relay links.

“Our current generation of HAWK pre-series products can be utilized for air-to-ground or air-to-air links. Future versions will also allow air-to-space scenarios. The demonstrations last year focused on air-to-ground operations as a starting point yet as demonstrations continue we plan to expand the mission envelope and performance parameters further” says the Mynaric CEO confirming to RGN that the flight campaign with H3 HATS continues to take place in Bavaria Germany.

Insights gathered from the flight campaign will help Mynaric to optimize the current product generation and guide the development of the next product generation. Because Mynaric is not yet focusing on the market for civil passenger aircraft it cannot yet determine whether HAWK is the right solution for this segment however.

Ultimately what type of speeds could be supported onboard commercial aircraft fitted with Mynaric’s technology RGN asked?

Says Altan:

Our next generation of space terminals CONDOR Mk3 already features up to 100 Gbps which is certainly also achievable for future generations of our airborne products. Beyond that we are already working on speeds in the Terabit per second domain for our space products and insights gathered there will also be beneficial for even higher speeds in the airborne domain. Laser communication stands today at the very beginning and still offers orders of magnitude of performance improvements as the technology and the market matures further. We are truly at the dawn of the Terabit-era for wireless long-distance airborne communication.

On 6 July L3Harris agreed to invest roughly EUR 11.2 million in Mynaric for an initial 7.2% stake. “With the strategic investment the companies seek to build on their existing collaboration in the airborne domain and widen the scope to cover all domains including space air maritime and ground” they stated at the time.

Under the arrangement Mynaric “will become a preferred provider of laser communications solutions and L3Harris will be granted certain collaboration privileges” including access to select test capabilities.

“While this strategic partnership is new” Altan tells RGN “we look to build collaboration that is mutually beneficial. Our investment in state-of-the art testing environments and labs will benefit L3Harris and we know that having an industry leader such as L3Harris taking this step shows efficacy for our technology and the market potential. The partnership is quite symbiotic as Mynaric provides laser communication products while L3Harris provides integration services of avionics equipment among many other products and services. In this early phase of the technology’s adoption we typically work closely with both the integrator and the end-customer.”

For now Mynaric is targeting unmanned aerial vehicles and the government as first adopters for laser communication capabilities in the airborne domain. “The timeline for adoption by more traditional civil aircraft will significantly depend on the operational success of laser communication capability adoption by these first users” says Altan.

Outside of aero the firm’s product range includes space applications covering space-to-space space-to-air and space-to-ground connectivity for satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) as well as Medium Earth Orbit (MEO). Its work in this particular segment is timely.

Telesat for instance has tapped Mynaric’s optical inter-satellite link (OISL) terminals for its DARPA Blackjack program test satellites in a deal “demonstrating continued success for Mynaric in accessing the US government market” according to Mynaric.

“The technology for laser communications in space has existed for decades but mainly in the context of research and development. Only in the past six to seven years did serious momentum build as companies like SpaceX OneWeb and Telesat began aggressively pursuing the technology for their Low Earth Orbit broadband constellations” notes Quilty Analytics a financial research and strategic advisory boutique that has launched a new report on optical intersatellite links.

“Without OISLs” suggests the report “visions of high-speed LEO broadband from companies like SpaceX and Amazon fall apart. These and other LEO systems will run into capacity bottlenecks and coverage gaps that will cost hundreds of millions – if not billions – of dollars to offset through larger ground station deployments. Even then they will fall short of espoused latency goals and will remain vulnerable to interference and security concerns. At least 15 companies are actively developing optical crosslink terminals and around 10 are planning to architect optical relay networks. Civil and military organizations are pumping time and money into OISLs across the US Europe and Japan with the goal of providing global coverage and implementing a secure low latency high-bandwidth satellite communications solution.”

However reality hit when she moved to an Indian company which refused her request. “I sensed a lack of trust” she said. “It is also a sense of control I guess as a boss does not know what the junior is up to while working in a completely remote environment.”

When the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown gobsmacked the world in the summer of 2020 it brought with it some dramatic new ways of living. WFH suddenly became the de facto standard with office workers of the world meeting on video conferencing apps like Zoom and children attending virtual classrooms. E-commerce sites and food delivery aggregators replaced shopping and eating out while OTT platforms became the go-to modes of entertainment.

Two years down the line however as the world moves slowly back to normalcy the poster boys of the ‘new normal’ are facing their big reality check. Across the spectrum the big push is to get things back to the physical to ‘how it used to be’.

Rather surprising considering the predictions that were made about the tectonic shift in the ways in which we will live work and play. So what exactly did change?

“People tend to underestimate the impact of change in the long run and overestimate the impact of change in the short run” said Raman Kumar Singh India CHRO of the multinational technology giant ABB. “I think a lot of companies went ahead of the change moving to the WFH model completely. While that must have been the need of the hour that’s where they overestimated how things will change in the short period.”

Take for instance the edtech sector. With schools shut the likes of Byju’s and Vedantu were touted as the future. Raghav Gupta MD (India & Pacific) of the global edtech firm Coursera predicted then: “A significant part of learning will move online (and) transform the education system…forever.” Some Rs37000 crore of funding flowed into the sector during this period; a lion’s chunk to the market leader Byju’s alone which went on an expansion spree snapping up other companies. It became the second most valuable startup in the country after Flipkart.

Then reality hit. As schools reopened and the funds from investors abroad dried up edtech companies started facing choppy waters. The government took note of the numerous customer complaints against Byju’s. Vedantu has been buffeted by allegations of kickbacks. Some 10000 employees have been laid off in the sector by the likes of Unacademy Lido Learning Toppr and WhiteHat Jr (the last two are subsidiaries of Byju’s).

The biggest irony however has been that after advocating for virtual learning model all the while some of these companies have opened physical coaching centres. Byju’s is aiming for 500 such centres across the country. “You either die trying or live long enough to become the very thing you went out to disrupt” sniped startup professional Manan Agarwal on Twitter.

The wheel has turned full circle not just for the edtech sector—almost all areas that saw a boom during the lockdown are seeing the flip side now. The International Monetary Fund and Harvard Business School tracked Mastercard usage in 47 countries from 2018 to 2021 and found that while online shopping rose sharply when the lockdowns hit it fell soon after. The share of e-commerce spending though higher than pre-pandemic level is just 0.6 per cent above the regular growth trend.

“One common narrative is that the pandemic accelerated digitalisation forcing consumers to learn how to shop online and that this learning was here to stay” the IMF researchers noted. “While our results support the quick uptake of e-commerce the persistence does not appear broad-based.”

The Swiggys and the Zomatos that urban India turned to make up for its lack of dining out options are facing the same crunch as Byju’s. With profits nowhere in sight and user growth slowing down both have tried diversification into grocery and 10-minute deliveries.

Netflix after being the unofficial entertainment partner to the pandemic is now facing desertions owing to the return of pre-pandemic schedules and persistent global inflation. As subscribers have started thinking twice before renewing their subscriptions it lost 10 lakh users in the April-June period and its share dropped 60 per cent in the first six months of the year.

It is a falling sensation the fellow pandemic poster boy Zoom is pretty familiar with. The app that the whole world turned to for meetings during the lockdown days has had its shares drop 41.3 per cent so far this year. It had grown a whopping 173 per cent during the two years of Covid-19.

While big companies seeing a correction is one thing even more surprising has been the veering off course of the WFH bandwagon. The return to office has been near-complete across the Indian workplace. “In a typical Indian company there is nothing called WFH pretty much anymore” said Rishi Das CEO and cofounder of the co-working space IndiQube. “The fact is that everybody is now expected to be back in office.”

It is quite a contrast to the initial months of the pandemic when even biggies like Google predicted the death of the office as it was. Tata Consultancy Services announced plans to keep at least 75 per cent of its employees working remotely and its CEO Rajesh Gopinathan said it was their new operating model that represented “the future of work”. TCS is now talking of the reverse and is aiming to get at least 80 per cent of its six lakh staff back at office. The likes of Google and Microsoft are all snapping up more office space across Indian cities. Traffic data shows that workplace visits are now 21 per cent above what it was before the lockdown in March 2020.

What changed? “The main reason companies wanted people to come back is to control attrition” said Rishi Das. As corporate India moved past the initial uncertainty over Covid and the opportunities of a brave new post-pandemic world became clear so did career prospects. Many switched to better jobs with better pay as companies sensed future opportunities and started hiring big time. As a result attrition levels shot up to worrisome levels. TCS for instance had an attrition level of about 20 per cent in the last quarter which is about one lakh employees leaving the organisation in just three months!

This coupled with a ‘screen’ fatigue after about two years of working ‘distantly’ the worries over training new recruits and the concern over the trend of ‘moonlighting’ (many professionals working from home had taken up additional gigs) set alarm bells ringing and finally seem to have ended the ‘work-from-anywhere’ dream.

But the biggest factor is something abstract—forming a connection. “Many companies have come to the realisation that when it comes to engagement and retention the fundamentals of employee connect still haven’t changed. You need to work with people get to know them and care for them. A transactional relationship doesn’t have tenure” said Jeevant Kumar senior director and head of HR at Lam Research a Fortune 500 semiconductor equipment company. “No water cooler moment (meant) our attrition was higher last year; it is harder to build connections while working remotely.”

“You don’t get the ‘persona’ on a Microsoft Teams call!” said Bhupindra Singh managing director (north India) of Colliers a multinational investment management company. “Personality is a very important factor in product manufacturing and services industries.”

There was a feeling that while productivity did go up in the initial phase of the lockdown too much of ‘screen time’ with professionals glued to their computer during working hours and to television and mobile phone after that was leading to a fatigue. “It just became too much” said Singh. “Market changes need deliberation strategy and thinking. That is not possible through technology mediums alone.”

Training of new employees was another pesky lacuna. “Most companies have grown 50 to 100 per cent. When you hire such a large number of people normally freshers through campus placements you have to train them. And that is not possible remotely” said Das.

However the pandemic has definitely left its imprint of change the biggest being hybrid working. A majority of Indian workplaces now have employees working between home and office. “A hybrid model has options and choices—it’s not a policy but we are creating a framework. As long as the final service and product is delivered to the customer we are allowing that choice to the employee and the manager as a unit” said Singh of ABB.

With attrition levels still high companies are treading carefully being very flexible in timings setting up branch offices and re-designing offices to offer perks. “Employees are now expecting everything—they want gyms food courts game areas” said Das. “I have had even conservative Marwari business owners coming to me asking for office redesign to incorporate these new requirements.”

The office may have made a comeback but in its post-Covid new avatar it is no longer central to the scheme of things. “We go to work only when there is a client meeting or training” said Eldho Skariah a software architect with CSG International in Bengaluru which offers flexi options to its employees. “Unless there are meetings I go to the office just once in a week. The actual work is all done while at home. The hybrid model is ideal as it helps us work creatively as well as manage things on the personal front too.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnUtdG9reW8uYWMuanAvZm9jdXMvZW4vcHJlc3MvejA1MDhfMDAyMzUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The many ways nature nurtures human well-being | The University of Tokyo,"A systematic review of 301 academic articles on “cultural ecosystem services” has enabled researchers to identify how these nonmaterial contributions from nature are linked to and significantly affect human well-being. They identified 227 unique pathways through which human interaction with nature positively or negatively affects well-being. These were then used to isolate 16 distinct underlying mechanisms or types of connection through which people experience these effects. This comprehensive review brings together observations from a fragmented field of research which could be of great use to policymakers looking to benefit society through the careful use and protection of the intangible benefits of nature.

Do you ever feel the need for a bit of fresh air to energize yourself or to spend time in the garden to relax? Aside from clean water food and useful raw materials nature provides many other benefits that we might overlook or find it hard to grasp and quantify. Research into cultural ecosystem services (CESs) the nonmaterial benefits we receive from nature aims to better understand these contributions whether they emerge through recreation and social experiences or nature’s spiritual value and our sense of place.

Hundreds of CESs studies have explored the connections between nature and human well-being. However they have often used different methods and measurements or focused on different demographics and places. This fragmentation makes it difficult to identify overarching patterns or commonalities on how these intangible contributions really affect human well-being. Better understanding them could aid real-world decision-making about the environment which could benefit individuals and the wider society.

To try and get a “big-picture” view graduate student Lam Huynh from the Graduate Program in Sustainability Science at the University of Tokyo and team conducted a systematic literature review of 301 academic articles. After a critical reading they were able to identify hundreds of links. “We identified 227 unique linkages between a single CES (such as recreation or aesthetic value) and a single constituent of human well-being (such as connectedness spirituality or health). We knew that there are many linkages but we were surprised to find quite so many of them” said Huynh. “Then through further critical reading we could identify major commonalities.”

In particular they identified 16 distinct underlying “mechanisms” or types of connection which refer to the different ways that people’s interaction with nature affects their well-being. For example there can be positive interactions through “cohesive” “creative” and “formative” mechanisms but also negative interactions through “irritative” and “destructive” mechanisms. Previous studies had identified some of these mechanisms but 10 were newly defined including the more negative effects clearly showing that our well-being is linked to the intangible aspects of nature in many more ways than previously thought.

According to the paper the negative contributions to human well-being came mainly through the degradation or loss of CESs and through ecosystem “disservices” such as annoyance at wildlife noise which can affect some people’s mental health in particular. However on the other hand the highest positive contributions of CESs were to both mental and physical health which were generated mainly through recreation tourism and aesthetic value.

“It is particularly interesting to note that the identified pathways and mechanisms rather than affecting human well-being independently often interact strongly” explained co-author Alexandros Gasparatos associate professor at the Institute for Future Initiatives (IFI) at the University of Tokyo. “This can create negative trade-offs in some contexts but also important positive synergies that can be leveraged to provide multiple benefits to human well-being.”

Despite the comprehensiveness of the review the researchers acknowledge that there may still be more links that have not yet been identified especially as the review revealed gaps in the current research landscape. “We hypothesize that missing pathways and mechanisms could be present in ecosystem-dependent communities and especially traditional and Indigenous communities considering their very unique relations with nature” said Gasparatos.

“Another of the knowledge gaps we identified is that the existing literature on these nonmaterial dimensions of human-nature relationships mainly focuses on the well-being of individuals rather than on collective (community) well-being” explained Huynh. “This significant gap hinders our capacity to identify possible synergies and trade-offs in ecosystem management research and practice.”

The team has now received a grant to explore the effects of CESs provision to human well-being in the urban spaces of Tokyo. “This project is a logical follow-up to test whether and how some of the identified pathways and mechanisms unfold in reality and intersect with human well-being” said Gasparatos.

The researchers hope that this study and similar efforts will make it possible to apply the key findings from this complex and diverse body of knowledge to enable real-world impact. Professor Kensuke Fukushi from IFI and study co-author summarized their hope that “an improved understanding of nature’s many connections to human well-being and the underlying processes mediating them can help policymakers to design appropriate interventions. Such coordinated action could leverage the positive contributions of these connections and become another avenue to protect and manage ecosystems sustainably.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L2xhdGVzdC1uZXdzL2lzLWl0LXdvcnRoLWludmVzdGluZy1pbi1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLXN0b2Nrc9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L2FtcC9zdG9yeS9sYXRlc3QtbmV3cy9pcy1pdC13b3J0aC1pbnZlc3RpbmctaW4tc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3Rvci1zdG9ja3M?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is it Worth Investing in Semiconductor Stocks?,Category 3. Suppliers of components. This is the backstage of the industry. Companies in this category do not produce semiconductors and do not have their own brands. But they supply manufacturers with production equipment and various testing services. A distinctive feature of this category is independence.

Fast forward to today and the northern region of Malaysia is heating up with record levels of investments and re-investments pouring in amounting in the billions of ringgit (see table).

But some interesting dynamics are taking place which could impact this semicon boomtown story for Malaysia.

For starters with so much new production being built is there a fear that the industry is heading into an oversupply situation?

This is more so given the recession headwinds impacting the global economy.

Then there’s the new law passed by the United States government. Dubbed the Chips (Creating Helpful Initiatives to Produce Semiconductors for America) Act the new law is aimed at drawing investment and production of semiconductors back to US shores.

“The shortage of the right talent is a big hurdle for Mida to attract foreign direct investment.”Datuk Arham Abdul Rahman

Will this then lead to a slowdown of investments coming into countries like Malaysia?

And yet another hot topic that is likely to add to the semiconductor saga is the heating up of geopolitical risks related to Taiwan.

US House Speaker Nancy Patricia Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan has escalated tensions between Taiwan and China. Fears of reprisals from China could pose a critical problem to the global supply of chips as Taiwan is home to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) the largest contract chipmaker in the world.

First the potential oversupply situation. Not only are the multinational firms ramping up their semiconductor-related operations in Malaysia but large local players are also doing the same.

For example Unisem (M) Bhd one of the largest assembly and testing players in the country is building a new production facility in Gopeng at a cost of RM300mil the first phase of which will be completed by next April.

Automated test equipment (ATE) manufacturer ViTrox Corp Bhd plans to invest between RM80mil and RM100mil in a new expansion project in Batu Kawan this year adding 447000 sq ft of floor space.

Globally also there are as many as 10 wafer fabrication plants (fabs) being built. China has been racing to get a stronger foothold in semiconductors throwing billions of dollars into the sector and building up capacity as quickly as they can.

Now more such operations are likely to get kickstarted in the US considering the financial allocations given by the US government via the Chips Act.

Wong: Malaysia needs to employ talent from other countries as well to resolve the shortage of engineers in the industry.

Cyclical industry

The semiconductor industry is a notoriously cyclical one. Manufacturers are constantly pressured to come up with new technologies that create smaller transistors.

Additionally fab construction and production boosts are slow and costly. Competition is ruthless. Companies risk losing out by the time their expansion plans are completed if their manufacturing know-how is behind their peers.

S&P Global Ratings pointed out this week that the global semiconductor cycle is heading for a downturn due to an ease in demand for consumer electronics. UOB Kay Hian Research in a recent report also projected global semiconductor sales to slow down in 2023 stemming from the expectation of a demand slowdown in the consumer electronics segment.

Deutsche Bank Research said in May that the current semiconductor cycle which began in October 2019 has been running for 29 months already above the historical average of 27.7 months.

But aren’t these exceptional times? It does seem so at least going by one industry veteran’s view. Datuk Seri Wong Siew Hai the president of the Malaysia Semiconductor Industry Association (MSIA) puts it like this: “There just seems to be no sign of a slowdown in the industry”.

Speaking to StarBizWeek via a Zoom interview Wong adds “So far the cyclical effect of the industry has not kicked in. The strong demand for chips has just persisted over the last two years.”

Wong notes that companies in the semiconductor ecosystem are going ahead with their expansion plans and that globally there are 10 fabs being built this year and another 10 next year.

He notes the supply crunch of chips worldwide was brought on largely by the pandemic that accelerated the demand for chips in the consumer electronics and automotive industries.

“During the pandemic many people were working from home so the sales of computers went up because they needed to set up their home offices.

“There was also a surge in gaming and eCommerce activities. Then there is the automotive industry that saw an increased number of people opting to buy cars instead of taking public transportation.

“All these activities need chips not excluding medical devices as well” Wong says.

He also explained that the situation was further exacerbated by fab closures in the US and Taiwan due to droughts the interruption of chip manufacturing operations in Germany due to power outages and the implementation of lockdowns and movement control orders in some countries including Malaysia which disrupted the production of semiconductors.

Wong however does not rule out a slowdown in the sector in the event of a full blown recession hitting countries across the globe or the outbreak of new wars.

Analysts say that despite the massive semiconductor supply coming into the market demand has never been so strong because of new industries being created that need more and more chips.

These include sectors like automotive computation and data storage and wireless.

McKinsey in its report this year projected 70% of growth in the chip industry will be driven by the aforementioned three industries.

The automotive industry is singled out to be the strongest growing segment whereby the demand for chips could triple by the end of the decade.

Last week MIDF Research pointed out that Singapore’s manufacturing output which grew at 13.8% year-on-year as at May 2022 was underpinned by higher production of semiconductors. This in turn stemmed from strong demand from 5G markets and data centres the report said.

Impact of US Chips Act

A significant development taking place in the global semiconductor space is the US passing the new Chips Act.

The law is aimed at helping the US regain its footing in chip manufacturing and becomes less dependent on foreign countries for crucial technologies.

Will it be a boon or bane for Malaysia’s semiconductor industry?

Chew Ne Weng who runs QES Group Bhd a niche Shah Alam-based ATE manufacturer reckons it is a huge boon for Malaysia.

“The Chips Act is overall very good for the semiconductor industry be it in the US Taiwan Japan as well as for players like us in South-East Asia.

Many companies in the ecosystem will enjoy the ‘waterfall effect’ of what the US will be doing. Malaysia is the main test and assembly packaging of integrated circuits for many US based multinationals such as Intel Micron Technology Inc and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.”

MSIA’s Wong concurs. He explains that Malaysia and South-East Asia will become beneficiaries of the legislation as the Chips Act is focused on encouraging companies like Samsung TSMC and Intel to build their leading edge manufacturing plants in the US and not so much for the “trailing edge” or back end part of the sector.

“We will benefit from the Chips Act because these corporations still need to outsource the packaging and testing services of semiconductors to other countries.

“As of now Malaysia is not vying to attract wafer fabs into the country. We will only see the downsides of the Chips Act if Malaysia intends to do so” he says.

In fact Wong suggests that Malaysian-based semiconductor players ought to be seriously looking at expanding their capacity and eyeing to secure the expected new orders that will come from the US stemming from the effects of the Chips Act.

“We have to expand our capacity of testing and assembly and other back end services to support the new volume of wafers coming out” he says.

Geopolitics and semiconductors

Politics seem to be increasingly impacting the chip industry one way or the other. For example the recently passed Chips Act is their government’s move to ensure the country has the security of supply of chips for its industries.

And what the US is doing has already long been done by China. As pointed out recently by the New York Times China’s drive to catch up and manufacture the most advanced chips is part of its “Made in China 2025” programme an effort that began in 2015.

The US-based Semiconductor Industry Association reckons that by 2030 China will have the largest stake in global semiconductor production due to its government’s significant investments in this sector.

Meanwhile tensions between China and Taiwan have escalated in recent days following Pelosi’s visit to the island.

At the height of her visit the shares of TSMC took a hit. It has recovered some of those losses but still trades lower than what it did at the end of last month.

Meanwhile TSMC’s chairman Mark Liu has told the media that if Taiwan were invaded by China the chipmaker’s plant would not be able to operate because it relies on global supply chains.

Experts also believe that a China conflict with Taiwan would severely disrupt the global chip technology supply chain.

In an article by Fortune this week an expert was quoted as saying that TSMC is the most irreplaceable company in the world today.

An economist was also quoted to say that Dutch firm ASML which works closely with TSMC to produce advanced microchips would likely move its key personnel out of Taiwan before any Chinese takeover.

Interestingly ASML is one of the global top names in the semiconductor industry to have a presence in Malaysia.

Another big firm here is Lam Research a leading US supplier of wafer fabrication equipment which invested RM1bil for a new plant in Penang which opened last year.

Lam Research is listed on Nasdaq with a market capitalisation of US$71.54bil (RM319bil) and its presence in Penang has spurred on the local industry there.

Another biggie in Malaysia is Jabil Circuit Inc a global provider of design engineering manufacturing and supply chain solutions which over the last few years has expanded its operations in the Batu Kawan Industrial Park.

This week Malaysian Investment Development Authority’s (Mida) chief executive Datuk Arham Abdul Rahman praised Jabil Penang’s efforts in accelerating automation and digitalisation initiatives through its partnerships with local vendors in Malaysia.

Meanwhile Wong points out how geopolitical tensions could work to Malaysia’s advantage.

“Because of the tension between the US and China some of them have been looking at Malaysia as a so-called neutral place for investment” he says.

He adds that many global companies seek to mitigate operational risks by building their factories in multiple regions. There is also a need to get closer to customers such as those already in Penang or Kulim he says.

But with so many companies coming into Penang and existing ones ramping up production is the infrastructure there stable enough to cater to this boomtime?

Available land for new plants in hot spots like Batu Kawan in Penang and the Kulim Hi-Tech Park in Kedah is hard to find and not to mention rising quickly in prices. Then there’s the concern of water and electricity as these plants consume a lot of it.

Nevertheless MSIA’s Wong opines that other than Penang which has issues with water availability Malaysia on a whole has enough water to support the semiconductor ecosystem.

“The usage of water is rising because many factories are coming into Malaysia. However Malaysia has sufficient water supply it is just a matter of location.

“Penang is among the few states that has water supply issues but this is not really concerning. Companies can choose to build their factories in other states like Kedah if Penang is unable to support the project. This is what is happening right now” he says.

Wong notes the main crux of the problem is actually the shortage of workers at every level. Although there are no definite reasons as to why the majority of Malaysians choose not to work in factories Wong speculates that it may be due to their preference for the gig economy which offers a more flexible working environment.

“When we talk about labour shortage in the chip industry we are not referring to unskilled workers. In this sector we need workers who have proper education at least up to Form Five or Form Six in order to be able to be qualified to be trained as professional personnel in the factories” he says.

Wong adds that Malaysia needs to employ talent from other countries as well to resolve the shortage of engineers in the industry.

“This shortage is also related to the number of students studying science and engineering in the country.

“The government should look into having programmes like other countries are doing that allow chip companies to hire students upon graduating to work for at least two years and the suitable candidates can be hired following that.”

Mida’s Arham concurs. He says the shortage of the right talent is a big hurdle for Mida to attract foreign direct investments.

“Although many big companies automate their production they still require the right talents to run the machines and the production lines.

“Whenever Mida approaches foreign investors to invest in Malaysia one of their main concerns is regarding the talent situation in our country” he says.

One thing is for sure the experts agreed regardless of geographical location or incentives Malaysia has the potential to not only maintain its existing semiconductor ecosystem but expand it as well.

“Malaysia is very strategically located in Asean and can act as a base to cater to other markets in the region.

“We are also one of the countries in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership that includes about one third of the world’s population. All these factors give Malaysia the edge when it comes to attracting more foreign direct investments into the country” says Arham.

Wong says that a strong ecosystem business-friendly government as well as having the right talent to move the chip industry are the reasons for Malaysia being an attractive place for investments.

“This year MSIA is celebrating 50 years. This means we have 50 years of experience in the semiconductor industry. We have the contractors technical consultants who know how to construct chip manufacturing factories.

We also have a business-friendly government with initiatives and task forces like the Express Construction Permit and Pemudah that are committed to reduce red tape and facilitate investments” he says.",,,

The restaurant is located at the hotel lobby and is 50 Eggs Hospitality Group’s newest concept together with world-renowned two-Michelin-star chef Tetsuya Wakuda.

The interior of Wakuda is elegant and contemporary where there is a beautiful bar area with a proud display of spirits and whiskeys. The main dining area is designed for couples or group dining with the centrestage being the open concept kitchen counter where the chefs are at work.

I love the mini garden right behind the kitchen counter which adds that bit of Japanese zen element to the dining ambience. There are also private rooms if you need to host guests. Other than Singapore Wakuda also has its presence in Las Vegas.

The Food The cuisine at Wakuda is a blend of traditional and modern Japanese dishes where you can expect to spend approximately S$100-S$200 per person.

I started off with a series of Appetisers like the Big Eye Tuna (S$32) where you get a Marinated Loin of Tuna set on Toasted Bread with Wasabi. Nice start to the meal where the fresh wasabi is quite muted.

The Yuba (S$38) is easily my favourite dish here. Think Fresh Bean Curd Skin from Kyoto mixed with with Hokkaido Sea Urchin and Mountain Caviar. It is served in a cocktail glass where the vibrant colours make it look visually appetising. The Kyoto yuba is amazing fresh flavours of the bean curd skin and the combination with the Uni and Caviar is divine.

Another strong appetiser on the menu the Canadian Lobsters (S$63) is a great showcase of the freshness of the ingredients used at Wakuda. The fresh lobster is simply marinated in Citrus and Vinegar along with Sea Asparagus and Shellfish Vinaigrette lending it a light touch in terms of seasoning and garnish as the fresh lobster flavour itself is the star. That said I polished off every bit of that refreshing shellfish vinaigrette.

For a carb dish I had the Cold Soba (S$72) where the Cold Buckwheat Noodle is served with Botan Shrimp Australian Manjimup Truffles and Fresh Oscietra Caviar. The soba is well-hidden beneath the mountain of black truffles (which I am not complaining about) and the overall flavour of this dish will appeal to any truffle lover. The truffle taste is not too in-your-face and I recommend mixing it all up and have all the ingredients together.

There is also a wide selection of sushi on the menu here. I managed to try three of the sushi items. My favourite of the lot is definitely the Otoro (S$38) Supreme Fat Tuna Belly which is rich and beyond tender.

The Nodoguro (S$36) also known as Blackthroat Sea Perch is another flavourful sushi I recommend to order. For something more accessible there is also the Aburi Ora King Salmon (S$15).

If there is one grilled dish to try I highly recommend the Carabineros Prawns (S$43) – Roasted Carabineros with Shellfish and Miso Risotto. I love that risotto which is soaked nicely in the prawn jus lending it a very moist texture and great flavours. As for the prawn it is not overly grilled such that it still retains that fresh flavour.

The other grilled dish I had was the Hokkaido Lake Saroma Wagyu (S$120) with smoked eggplant and seasonal vegetables. Japanese Wagyu beef rarely goes wrong and this Hokkaido breed is succulent and each serving is approximately 100g.

I am not big on desserts though I would say save space for desserts here. The Japanese Musk Melon from Shizuoka (S$28) with Cointreau Granita & Fromage Blanc Sorbet sounds heavy but is surprisingly light and refreshing.

The Green Tea and Azuki Bean Terrine (S$25) with Vanilla Ice Cream Kuromitsu Syrup & Matcha Lace is my favourite option of the three desserts I tried. You get an intense matcha flavour well-balanced by the red bean and vanilla ice cream.

Lastly the Wakuda’s House Special (S$13) is essentially Soft Serve Miso Coconut Ice Cream. I do find it a tad too sweet and my threshold for sweeteness is quite low these days.

Rants It will definitely be great if Wakuda can be opened for lunch soon.

Will I Return Again? I would like to think of Wakuda as a more affordable option to have a taste of Chef Tetsuya Wakuda’s cuisine as opposed to Waku Ghin. It is a relaxed dining setting where the dishes are generally very competent and is an ideal venue for a date night or gathering with friends.

~

Notification of the current issue UK MoD five-year Supply of Combat Boots contracts (LSL/DC/0001 0034 & 0035) was dispatched on 1st August 2017 and these are now rapidly drawing to an end though a ‘plus two year’ option may well be taken up to bridge the gap until the next contract (PIN Ref: LSL/DC/0131) is awarded and new boot types enter the supply system. The estimated date of publication of the next Combat Boots contract notice (i.e. the start of the formal tender process) was originally given as 7th February 2022 with anticipated supply commencement in late 2023 but as with many UK MoD procurement contracts the project timeline seems to have slipped quite considerably and at time of writing no notification has yet been published.

Over the last quarter century or so the Combat Boots sector has become one of my three primary areas of speciality ~ the others being Field Rations (hence my waistline) and Military Utility Vehicles ~ and as a result I have penned quite a few articles on the topic and photographed many different footwear types including the primary UK MoD combat boot models. While we wait for firm news on the start of the next round of boot procurement for UK Forces now strikes me as an ideal time to look back at the last two five-year contract batches for UK combat boots: DC2B/2606 2607 & 2608 awarded May / June 2012; and LSL/DC/0001 0034 & 0035 awarded June / July 2017.

The first of these ‘brown boot’ contracts roughly coincided with the widespread introduction of MTP (Multi-Terrain Pattern) uniform camouflage to replace the long-standing Temperate and Desert variants of DPM (Disruptive Pattern Material) camo so this makes an ideal break point but first it probably makes sense to briefly set the scene prior to this. From 2004 through to 2011 all UK Forces footwear across 32 different categories from Men’s Hot Weather Safety Boots through to Women’s Black Service Shoes and encompassing five categories of Combat or Patrol Boots was provided by one sole main supplier (Iturri SA) in a £175 million contract but several different manufacturers provided various models through this main contractor.

UK MoD 2012 Procurement: In the summer of 2012 however following a series of comparison tests of many different boot makes three suppliers ~ Iturri of Spain HAIX of Germany and YDS of Turkey ~ were awarded combat / patrol / jungle boot contracts. HAIX and YDS supplied their own boot models but those boots supplied by Iturri also included ALTBERG Magnum and Meindl models. To allow soldiers a choice of fit and to reduce the percentage of ‘boot chits’ issued for non-standard footwear when only a single fit was available two different models were issued in each of the five main Categories though only one type was selected for the low volume sixth Category:-

Category 1: Combat High Liability

Category 2: Patrol

Category 3: Desert Combat High Liability

Category 4: Desert Patrol

Category 5: Cold Wet Weather

Category 6: Jungle (not illustrated here)



2012 Cat 1: Boots CHL (Combat High Liability) were the ALTBERG Defender supplied by Iturri and the HAIX Scout ~ my ALTBERG samples were pre-production and were more olive in colour than the production batch [©BM]



2012 Cat 2: Boots Patrol were the Bates Ultra supplied by Iturri and the YDS Kestrel ~ intended primarily for barracks / garrison use rather than the potential combat zone both boot models had leather and textile combination uppers [©BM]

Although in theory all troops should have been given the opportunity to try on both types of boot in the categories demanded by their role to allow them to choose the boot which best suited their foot shape quite a few who I spoke to during the first year or two of issue of the 2012 batch said they were not actually allowed this choice. Reasons for this apparently included demands for formation conformity and uniformity of dress and/or local dictation that only all-leather boots capable of being polished should be worn by some units especially on the parade ground. (I well remember talking to a regimental recruiting team from a Guards regiment who wearing highly polished Arctic spec Cold Wet Weather boots in a town centre on a baking hot summers day). Some officers also expressed the view to me that in their view it was unrealistic to expect a quartermaster to allow troops to open two boxes and try on two pairs of boots when only one pair would be issued. It was also suggested that holding twice the number of pairs of boots in Stores could both create excessive paperwork and take up too much shelf space when compared with just holding stocks of a single boot model.



2012 Cat 3: Boots DCHL (Desert Combat High Liability) were the HAIX Desert Scout and the Meindl Desert Fox supplied by Iturri ~ both had suede and textile uppers and were intended for frontline wear so were of sturdier construction than Cat 4 [©BM]



2012 Cat 4: Boots DP (Desert Patrol) were the Magnum Desert Scorpion supplied by Iturri and the YDS Desert Falcon ~ also of suede and textile uppers construction these were not quite as sturdy as they were intended primarily for rear echelon wear [©BM]



2012 Cat 5: Boots CWW (Cold Wet Weather) were the HAIX Alaska and a KarrimorSF branded model which was supplied by Iturri ~ this category of well-insulated boot was intended for troops earmarked for Arctic / High North deployments [©BM]

Looking towards the second 5-year brown boot procurement in May 2015 the MoD Defence Clothing team at Abbey Wood issued a Contract Notice announcing “a requirement for the supply of 5 types of combat footwear. It will be tendered as 5 separate lots 2 choices of boots will be selected for Lots 1 and 2 and 1 choice of boot for Lots 3 4 and 5. Up to 7 year (configured as an initial 5 year period plus 2 year option) framework agreements could be awarded. The requirement is based on the estimated number of pairs of boots required to support operational deployments and routine maintenance for the UK Armed Forces and entitled civilians.” The Lots and estimated quantities (i.e. number of pairs for the 7 year period based on historical usage) for this requirement potentially worth £84million excl. VAT were given as:-:

Lot 1 – Combat High Liability Boot (300000)

Lot 2 – Desert Combat High Liability Boot (90000)

Lot 3 – Cold Wet Weather Boot (150000)

Lot 4 – Jungle Boot (42000)

Lot 5 – Patrol Boot (190000)

According to Abbey Wood Contract Notice 2015/S 094-169783 dispatched 12 May 2015: “Suppliers invited to tender may submit up to 4 different pairs of boots per Lot that best meet the performance specifications. All samples submitted at tender stage will be subject to a selection process that includes extensive testing and user trials prior to contract award. The evaluation process is expected to happen in the following stages – Tender Evaluation User Assessment Panel Gross Error Trial and finally the Full User Trial. Precise criteria will be detailed in the tender documents. Provided you are successful at each stage you will be expected to supply following numbers of boots gratis – 2 pairs (1 male 1 female) for the Tender Evaluation and User Assessment Panel 12 pairs (mixed male and female) per solution for the Gross Error Trial between 50 and 150 pairs (mixed male and female) per solution for the Full User Trial.” Even though the potential supplier offering only a single model in a single Lot would have to provide up to 164 free pairs of boots to the MoD for trials with no guarantee of a contract at the end we now know that 15 tenders were actually received; in the middle of the last decade winning a UK Forces footwear contract clearly had sufficient kudos to make an expense like this worth the investment.

UK MoD 2017 Procurement: When Contract Award Notice 2017/S 147-304025 for The Supply of Combat Footwear was published it was revealed that the total value of the procurement (excluding VAT) was £59400000: on 05 June 2017 Iturri SA was awarded a £44.7 million contract for boots in Lots 1 2 3 4 and 5; on 12 June 2017 Aku Italia was awarded an £11.5 million contract for boots in Lot 1 only; and on 17 July 2017 HAIX Schuhe was awarded a £3.2 million contract for boots in Lot 2 only. As 2017 Lot 4 the Jungle Boot is only issued for tropical deployments and in comparatively small quantities we have not been able to try or even photograph a pair. However with the exception of the HAIX 2017 Lot 2 DCHL boot a single sample of which I managed to photograph on the manufacturer’s stand at a defence expo I have been able to wear review pairs of the rest and my articles can all be found elsewhere in this Footwear section for those who are interested in more detail.

The UK MoD procurement chain like many other public service departments has a reputation for sometimes being about as speedy as a sloth on Mogadon ~ the AJAX family of tracked vehicles which evolved out of an earlier armoured vehicle project aimed at bringing CVR(T) replacements into service by 2010 being their most high profile and costly fiasco at the moment ~ so it is no great surprise that the next Supply of Combat Boots programme is already six months behind schedule. In June 2021 it was stated (in Notice 2021/S 000-014465) that the ‘Estimated Date of Publication of Contract Notice’ was 07 February 2022 but as of 07 August no announcement has been published; incidentally rumour from those in the know has it that the latest VIRTUS integrated body armour helmet and load carriage system procurement programme is on the same slow boat as the Combat Boots. As despite a recent week’s worth of contacting different buck-passing MoD departments we cannot get a simple answer from civilian Army Communications Officers about the dates of a forthcoming media facility to allow us to schedule coverage sloth-like procurement department behaviour does not really surprise us.

Over the last couple of years not only have companies who have previously supplied UK MoD with combat boots ~ such as ALTBERG HAIX and LOWA ~ introduced new models incorporating the latests technology and materials but other NATO nation boot manufacturers like Samelin from Estonia are raising their profile with new boot models aimed at wider markets. It will be interesting to see not only who tenders for the next UK MoD boot contract when documents are finally published but also which boots are short-listed for evaluation and eventually selected.

The beauty mogul was accompanied by her 4-year-old daughter Stormi and the two were twinning in matching pants as they enjoyed the rapper giving a power-packed performance on the stage.

Kylie Jenner shared adorable pictures and videos from the concert on her official Instagram handle. In no time the post started going viral.

While Scott was performing on the stage a concert-goer threw an object on the stage but it missed Scott. And the rapper seemed pretty pissed by the incident.

The show at The O2 marked Travis' return to a concert as a headliner after a year. He last performed at the Astroworld concert which turned out to be the deadliest American concert since the 2017 mass shooting at a country music festival in Las Vegas. The Houston concert was headlined by Scott last year and was a joint venture between the rapper and promoters ScoreMore Shows and Live Nation.

As Scott was performing on the stage a crowd surge claimed several lives and left many injured. According to reports cries for help were heard around 9:30 pm. Around that time some exuberant concert-goers began pushing to move forward during the performance. And almost 50000 people were present at the venue when the incident took place. Twenty-five people were reportedly hospitalized at the time and eight were confirmed dead on the spot.

Along with the four-year-old Kylie and Travis share a son Wolf Webster whom they welcomed this February. On the music front Travis recently announced his upcoming residency Road To Utopia which is set to take place at Resorts World in Las Vegas.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Aug. 4 2022 — Following a successful launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida today the U.S. Space Force is now communicating with the sixth Space Based Infrared System Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (SBIRS GEO) -6 satellite built by Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT).

The final satellite in the SBIRS program series GEO-6 joins the U.S. Space Force’s constellation of missile warning satellites equipped with powerful scanning and staring infrared surveillance sensors.

“The need for Overhead Persistent Infrared systems has never been more critical” said Michael Corriea vice president of Lockheed Martin Space’s Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) Mission Area. “At Lockheed Martin we are making advancements to keep pace with evolving needs based on emerging threats in our military customers’ environment helping pave the way for the future.”

The GEO-6 satellite is a stepping stone toward the resilient missile warning to be provided by SBIRS’ successor the Next Generation OPIR GEO System (NGG). Like SBIRS GEO-5 and GEO-6 NGG will be based on Lockheed Martin’s modernized LM 2100 Combat Bus™ which provides additional capabilities such as cyber hardening resiliency features enhanced spacecraft power and improved propulsion and electronics.

The SBIRS GEO-6 satellite is responding to the U.S. Space Force’s commands as planned. Signal acquisition was confirmed 3 hours and 43 minutes after the satellite’s 6:29 a.m. EDT lift off aboard a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket. The satellite is now orbiting under its own propulsion following separation from the rocket. The onboard sensors collect data that allow the U.S. military to detect missile launches support ballistic missile defense expand technical intelligence gathering and bolstering situational awareness on the battlefield.

A Step Toward More Resiliency

The OPIR mission has become more critical as ballistic missile technology has proliferated around the world with over 1000 missile launches tracked annually. Lockheed Martin recognizes that modernized technology is needed to augment the current missile warning architecture and improve resiliency against attacks.

“SBIRS GEO-6 fortifies the current missile warning architecture and it also signifies that we are on our way to achieving even greater technological capacity and expanded coverage with NGG” Corriea said.

Lockheed Martin is proud to be part of the SBIRS team led by Space Systems Command’s Space Sensing Directorate at Los Angeles Air Force Base. Lockheed Martin Space Sunnyvale California is the SBIRS prime contractor with Northrop Grumman of Azusa California as the payload supplier.

So why not try and add some sort of laser weapon that could damage any enemy in the sky? Enter the LANCE Project: Noted science fiction author H.G. Wells was certainly a visionary who foresaw many advanced technologies – and while the world will never likely see the invention of a time machine he conceived of a “heat ray” a weapon that isn’t all that distinct from modern lasers. Used by the Martian invaders in his 1898 serialized story and later novel The War of the Worlds the weapon predated actual lasers by sixty years.

Other authors would build on the theme and there would be the “death-ray” seen in George Griffiths’ novel The World Masters (1903) and of course the ubiquitous ray guns that showed up in the various Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon serials of the 1930s. Such energy weapons are now a staple of science fiction appearing with various names: lasers phasers disruptors and blasters.

Science fiction is now becoming reality – at least according to Lockheed Martin which has been developing its “Tactical Airborne Laser Weapon System” (TALWS) a platform that could be mounted on aircraft.

Tip of the LANCE

This month Lockheed Martin announced that it had delivered a compact directed energy weapon to the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) this past February reaching a key milestone in the efforts that would see tactical fighter jets equipped with a laser capable of shooting down anti-aircraft missiles. Dubbed “LANCE” – “Laser Advancements for Next-generation Compact Environments” – it has been under development for several years.

Lockheed Martin had been awarded the contract to design develop and produce the system in November 2017 as part of the United States Air Force’s Self-protect High Energy Laser Demonstrator (SHiELD) program.

“It is the smallest lightest high energy laser of its power class that Lockheed Martin has built to date” Tyler Griffin a company executive told reporters earlier this month in the run up to the Farnborough Air Show Breaking Defense reported. “It is a critical benchmark in developing an operational laser weapon system in the airborne domain.”

LANCE is a compact high-efficiency laser that was designed to address the constraints of mounting such a weapon on a fighter aircraft. This follows efforts by the company to provide a 60 kW-class laser that was installed on a U.S. Army ground vehicle as part of the Robust Electric Laser Initiative program. The LANCE system is reportedly one-sixth the size of the Army laser and it is complemented by a pod subsystem that mounts to the aircraft while it includes a beam control targeting system.

These subsystems are the most compact and capable laser weapon technologies delivered to date” said Kent Wood acting director of AFRL’s directed energy directorate who added “Mission utility analyses and wargaming studies are ongoing and will help determine how these subsystems and/or an integrated laser weapon system might potentially be used. Specific targets for future tests and demonstrations will be determined by the results of these studies as well.”

Joint Effort is Ongoing

Developing such a futuristic weapon is apparently too great even for the country’s largest defense contractor. That is why SHiELD is actually a collaborative effort that involves several industry rivals. As reported by TheDrive Lockheed Martin has been contracted to provide the actual laser weapon in the form of LANCE while aerospace giant Boeing has produced the pod that carries it and Northrop Grumman is now responsible for the beam control system that puts the laser onto its target.

Development is ongoing and it will be sometime before LANCE is able to actually be fired. First there will need to be efforts to integrate the weapon with the thermal systems that manage the heating and cooling. Moreover there has been no decision on any specific application or platform that could be employed with the LANCE.

No flight demonstration has been funded either.

Simply put LANCE is just the first step of what will be many before we can expect to see F-35s flying around with laser weapons. It takes time to develop the weapons of the future and many steps to get there.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbGlzdGVuL3Byb2dyYW1zL2FiYy1uZXdzLWRhaWx5L2NoaW5hLXJ1c3NpYS1hbmQtdGhlLXJhY2UtZm9yLW5ldy1oeXBlcnNvbmljLW1pc3NpbGVzLzEwMTMwOTEwNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China Russia and the race for new hypersonic missiles,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/abc-news-daily/china-russia-and-the-race-for-new-hypersonic-missiles/101309104 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbGlzdGVuL3Byb2dyYW1zL2FiYy1uZXdzLWRhaWx5L2NoaW5hLXJ1c3NpYS1hbmQtdGhlLXJhY2UtZm9yLW5ldy1oeXBlcnNvbmljLW1pc3NpbGVzLzEwMTMwOTEwNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

Two new recall actions are in place concerning devices that might cut you while you’re using them. One of them is DeWALT’s 12-inch Sliding Compound Miter Saws which sold more than 1.4 million units across the US and Canada. The other involves Makita’s cordless hedge trimmers which sold only about 2600 units in the US.

Both devices have the same problem. A part that should protect the user might lead to laceration injuries. DeWALT already received 571 malfunction reports including 9 injuries.

DeWALT’s power tool recall

DeWALT announced the 12-inch Sliding Compound Miter Saws recall this week. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) posted the announcement at this link. Similarly the Canadian recall authority published its own report — you can see it here.

The company explains the power tool features a rear safety guard that can break or detach. If that happens the user and bystanders might be exposed to projectiles. They also risk coming in contact with the power tool’s saw blade which is obviously quite dangerous.

DeWALT sold 1364000 12-inch Sliding Compound Miter Saws in the US. Moreover Canadian buyers bought an additional 118600 units.

In the US the power tool models in the recall were available at Lowe’s Home Depot and other hardware stores nationwide. Customers might have also purchased them online at Amazon Lowes and other websites.

The company sold the saws for between $600 and $820 from April 2019 through May 2022.

DeWALT says the power tool recall involves models DWS779 DWS780 and DHS790 Miter Saws. You’ll find the model numbers on the saw’s nameplate. But only the models with date codes 2019 04 through 2022 04 suffer from the problem.

The date codes appear on the black plastic motor end cap adjacent to the nameplate on the DWS779 and DWS780 models. The DHS790 model has the date code on the outside of the yellow plastic housing adjacent to the batteries. Furthermore the recall only covers saws without a green dot on the nameplate or a black dot on the arm.

Makita’s cordless hedge trimmer recall

The next power tool recall also involves an electric device made for cutting. We’re looking at Makita’s cordless hedge trimmers which also pose the risk of injury to users. The company announced the recall this week and this action is limited to the US. The CPSC report is available at this link.

Makita explains that the teal guard on the hedge trimmer’s shear blade is missing. As a result the trimmer has an increased chance of causing injury while in use.

The company sold the power tool in the recall nationwide from February 2022 through June 2022. The device cost between $260 and $460. Makita sold about 2600 units which were available at various home improvement and hardware stores. It was also sold online via Home Depot and Amazon.

Various model numbers and serial numbers are included in the recall. You’ll find the model number on the side of the trimmer. The serial number sits on the battery mounting port.

Unlike DeWALT’s power tools the Makita hedge trimmer in this recall has not yet caused any known injuries.

What you should do

If you own any of these power tools you should stop using them to avoid the risk of injury. Both recalls offer the same remedy in the form of free repairs.

DeWALT urges customers to contact the company for info on how to receive a free repair kit. Alternatively you can take the power tool to a DeWALT service center for a free repair. The company will contact all known buyers but you can also reach out.

American buyers will find contact information for DeWALT at this link. Canadians should check out the local recall announcement.

Makita also instructs customers to stop using the power tools in the recall. They should contact the company to arrange a free repair.

Makita will provide consumers with a merchandise return label so they can ship the trimmer back for repairs. Then the company will return the fixed trimmer with a teal guard on the blade. Contact information for Makita is available at this link.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9tb3JnYW50b24vbmFtZS9yaWNoYXJkLWdyaWZmaW4tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzYxNjIwMDnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Richard Griffin Obituary (1940 - 2022) - Charlotte NC - The News Herald,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/morganton/name/richard-griffin-obituary?id=36162009 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9tb3JnYW50b24vbmFtZS9yaWNoYXJkLWdyaWZmaW4tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzYxNjIwMDnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL3ZhbHNwYXItMjAyMy1jb2xvcnMtb2YtdGhlLXllYXItMzcxMTY2NDDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Valspar's 2023 Colors of the Year Will Evoke Positive Emotions,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/valspar-2023-colors-of-the-year-37116640 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL3ZhbHNwYXItMjAyMy1jb2xvcnMtb2YtdGhlLXllYXItMzcxMTY2NDDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

You need to get over your reclining seat rage,"Editor’s Note: Heather Poole is a flight attendant for a major US carrier and author of “Cruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpads Crew Drama and Crazy Passengers at 30000 Feet.” The views in this commentary are her own. Read more CNN Opinion.

CNN —

Last night on a flight from London to New York a passenger rang his call light and when my colleague walked over turned off the light and asked him if he needed something he simply pointed to the reclined seat in front of him.

The flight attendant told him that his seat was also in the reclined position and then mentioned that the seat next to him — the aisle seat — was available and that he could sit there. The man said he didn’t want to move to the aisle seat because he wanted to sit by the window.

Sometimes there are no solutions to problems like this.

Another day another flight: “If you put your seat back one more time I’m going to punch you in the face” said an older woman to a teenage girl seated in front of her. The young girl’s eyes looked like they might pop out of their sockets.

While standing in the aisle pouring a can of Diet Coke into a cup of ice I told the aggrieved passenger that nobody was going to punch anyone and that if she said another word about it or did anything to anyone authorities would be called to meet the flight.

“He’s in my lap!” cried a different passenger on a different flight. This one sat in the window seat.

I looked at the woman and then at the man in front who was clearly not in her lap. He was close though about a foot away. Sorry I mouthed. I handed her a can of club soda and a cup of ice and communicated to her in words I knew she’d understand: “Unfortunately he’s allowed to be in your lap.”

Besides lack of wifi or a broken entertainment system flight attendants hear more complaints about reclined seats than anything else.

The heart of the problem is that airlines are packing too many seats too closely together into a tight space. Remember legroom? But this squeeze doesn’t give passengers the right to react in such a way that the crew feels the need to divert a flight to have a passenger removed. That’s a really big deal that usually ends up with someone in police custody.

While I dread these altercations I think some passengers need to chill out — people have the right to recline their seat. Nobody has to ask for permission to recline their seat. Some people believe passengers have to put their seats in the upright position during the meal service. This isn’t true. At least not with US carriers even though it’s a nice thing to do.

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. Heather Poole

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. If you kick the seat or threaten to punch someone in the face you’ll be the one removed from the flight — not the person who moved their seat back two inches.

Not all airlines are created equal. Yes some airlines are taking away the recline option on all seats but these are mostly low-cost carriers which should tell you something about what those passengers want: cheap flights … including seats that don’t recline. (A friend who often flies Air France on short and medium-hop routes in Europe tells me that their seats are all locked upright. “I’ve never seen anyone get worked up about it” he said.)

Airlines are desperate to cut costs. It’s rumored that American Airlines removed a single olive off of business class meal trays and saved $40000 a year. So you’d think that 150 lighter seats per flight will certainly save an airline a ton of money. Remember the recline mechanism in the seat makes it heavier which increases fuel costs for the airline. A lighter seat that doesn’t recline is also a seat that is less likely to break which saves an airline money in repairs.

Non-reclining seats are nothing new. Major carriers have always had a few seats that don’t recline. Think exit rows and the last row. While some passengers aren’t always happy to get one of these seats it never seems to be that big of a deal.

But after 28 years in the job I’ve found there’s some basic reclining etiquette that makes for a smoother flight for everyone.

A reminder: chances are the person in front of you has no idea they’ve crossed that mental barrier between you and the rest of the world. You can’t kick them or scream at them but you can politely ask if they’d mind putting their seat back up. I bet if you ask nicely they’ll do it.

If you’re a passenger who likes to recline it’s always a good idea to be mindful of the situation that we are all collectively in and do so slowly. Yanking the seat back too quickly could make a mess if the person behind you has their tray table down.

Sure everyone feels cramped in coach seats. But the bigger you are the tighter the squeeze so consider glancing back before you adjust your seat. If it’s Shaquille O’Neal behind you maybe give the guy a break.

We do see spilled drinks and from time to time broken laptops. Seasoned business passengers know what to expect and book seats with more legroom. But on coach middle seat passengers struggle to type because there’s no arm space. The table is so much smaller these days and there’s barely room for a drink. So if you think you’re going to work on your laptop and balance a cup of coffee on that table well you might need to seriously rethink your spatial judgement.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned flying the unfriendly skies it’s this: you can’t please everyone. Somebody is going to suffer somebody is going to have a miserable flight somebody will be assigned the last row or a middle seat or will have to come into contact with a child. Now I’m going to tell you what I used to tell my son when he was little every time we traveled together: there’s no crying in flying. Toughen up.

Really this isn’t a war on reclined seats. This is about space and most airlines give you the option to purchase more space. So remember that next time you’re searching for the cheapest flight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvZmxvcmlkYS1hLW0tYmFja3MtYXdheS1mcm9tLWR1YmlvdXMtMjM3bS1kb25hdGlvbi0wMDE1NzIzNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Florida HBCU backs away from dubious $237M donation,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/09/florida-a-m-backs-away-from-dubious-237m-donation-00157234 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvZmxvcmlkYS1hLW0tYmFja3MtYXdheS1mcm9tLWR1YmlvdXMtMjM3bS1kb25hdGlvbi0wMDE1NzIzNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS91cy1uZXdzL2JpbGxpb25haXJlLWJ1bGx5LWthdGhlcmluZS1hc3BsdW5kaHMtbmV3LWluLWxhd3MtaGF2ZS05NW0taGlzdG9yeS1vZi1leHBsb2l0aW5nLXVuZG9jdW1lbnRlZC13b3JrZXJzL9IBkAFodHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS91cy1uZXdzL2JpbGxpb25haXJlLWJ1bGx5LWthdGhlcmluZS1hc3BsdW5kaHMtbmV3LWluLWxhd3MtaGF2ZS05NW0taGlzdG9yeS1vZi1leHBsb2l0aW5nLXVuZG9jdW1lbnRlZC13b3JrZXJzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Billionaire bully Katherine Asplundh's new in-laws have $95M history of exploiting undocumented workers: ruling,"Pennsylvania’s billionaire Asplundh family were dragged into a bullying scandal after their son’s new wife tried to force another woman to give up her Instagram handle and now it has emerged they were once fined $95 million for hiring undocumented workers.

According to a 2017 press release from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Asplundh Tree Experts now reportedly worth $5 billion pleaded guilty to employing workers it knew were using false identification papers and received the fine.

According to the release upper managers “remained willfully blind while lower level managers hired and rehired employees they knew to be ineligible to work in the United States.”

The company paid $80 million in criminal forfeiture and $15 million in civil payment.

The $95 million total is still the recordholder for the largest immigration judgment in history.

The family name came under the microscope again this week when Katherine Driscoll Asplundh — who married Cabot Asplundh on April 27 — allegedly tried to bully a user with the name Katherine Asplundh into signing over the rights to her Instagram handle.

According to screenshots of the conversation posted to the NYCInfluencesnark sub Reddit the new Katherine Asplundh started off with a breezy message.

“Hi just wondering if I could purchase your username from you” the newlywed wrote.

“I just got married and this is my new name.”

The other Katherine Asplundh kindly refused.

“Hi congrats! That’s my name too” she wrote. “I just googled and it said selling my username would get me banned from Instagram.”

From there things deteriorated between the two Katherine Asplundhs.

“I purchased my username in the past actually that’s not true” responded the billionaire’s wife.

“Celebrities do it all the time that’s how they all have their handles as their full names. So weird I didn’t know there was another Asplundh’s family out there [sic]. There no Katherine Asplundh in our family.”

Upon receiving no response the billionaire’s wife pointed out that the other Katherine wasn’t very active on Instagram and should therefore change her name to accommodate her.

The other Katherine then told the billionaire’s wife that the account was a “finsta” or fake Instagram that she uses for private stories and archiving photos and that her main account uses her maiden name.

Irritated Driscoll-Asplundh argued that the other woman’s name wasn’t really Katherine Asplundh and that she would be reported.

“I actually don’t believe that your name is Katherine Asplundh who would make their finsta their actual name? I reported you to Instagram and they’re actually able to tell me your real name I really hope I don’t know you because that’s gonna be really embarrassing for you.”

Driscoll-Asplundh then demanded to see documentation that the other woman was not lying about her name.

After the other woman posted the screenshots the newlywed deleted her Instagram account.

The new bride’s in-laws own the Asplundh Tree Expert Co. in Pennsylvania which is the 109th largest private company in America with a revenue of $5.42 billion in 2023 according to Forbes.

Katherine’s new father-in-law Matt Asplundh has been the CEO of the family business since 2021.

Since Thursday night ABC-7 had been receiving calls and emails from frustrated drivers who said many gas stations had no fuel or only sold premium gas or diesel. The calls indicated this problem was happening around the Borderland including Horizon City far east east northeast west and central El Paso. Las Cruces gas stations were also experiencing similar problems.

ABC-7 spoke to employees at dry gas stations who say they never received a shipment of fuel from the Marathon Petroleum refinery in El Paso.

Our newsroom reached out to Marathon Petroleum to find answers.

A spokesman from the company said there were necessary repairs that had to be completed at the fuel terminal located right next to the refinery. A fuel terminal is an industrial site that stores oil and petroleum products and where fuel tankers are loaded with the product to be sent to gas stations.

The spokesman elaborated saying the repairs were being made to the instrumentation at the fuel terminal. The repairs suspended fuel loading at the terminal on Wednesday Aug. 3.

The spokesman said Sunday morning the repairs are complete and loading of fuel tankers has resumed.

The gas shortage stemming from the fuel terminal suspension created frustration for many El Paso drivers who could not find a gas station to fill-up their cars.

One man ABC-7 spoke to Mike Ahumada said he had driven over three miles and multiple stations with no luck.

“I drove over to this big gas station right off the interstate and found out that there is no gas. I also went to several other gas stations Sam’s club like six other gas stations over here and they had no gas. Period"" Ahumada explained.

Another woman Nancy Estrada was driving around a U-Haul truck trying to find gas before she turned the vehicle back in. She had to return the truck with a full tank or the company would charge her.

“This is the fourth gas station I have come to with no luck of getting gas. I have to fill up the tank in order to turn it in and now I’m going to have to pay U-Haul in order for them to fill up the tank themselves"" Estrada said.

Since Thursday night ABC-7 had been receiving calls and emails from frustrated drivers who said many gas stations had no fuel or only sold premium gas or diesel. The calls indicated this problem was happening around the Borderland including Horizon City far east east northeast west and central El Paso. Las Cruces gas stations were also experiencing similar problems.

ABC-7 spoke to employees at dry gas stations who say they never received a shipment of fuel from the Marathon Petroleum refinery in El Paso.

Our newsroom reached out to Marathon Petroleum to find answers.

A spokesman from the company said there were necessary repairs that had to be completed at the fuel terminal located right next to the refinery. A fuel terminal is an industrial site that stores oil and petroleum products and where fuel tankers are loaded with the product to be sent to gas stations.

The spokesman elaborated saying the repairs were being made to the instrumentation at the fuel terminal. The repairs suspended fuel loading at the terminal on Wednesday Aug. 3.

The spokesman said Sunday morning the repairs are complete and loading of fuel tankers has resumed.

The gas shortage stemming from the fuel terminal suspension created frustration for many El Paso drivers who could not find a gas station to fill-up their cars.

One man ABC-7 spoke to Mike Ahumada said he had driven over three miles and multiple stations with no luck.

“I drove over to this big gas station right off the interstate and found out that there is no gas. I also went to several other gas stations Sam’s club like six other gas stations over here and they had no gas. Period"" Ahumada explained.

Another woman Nancy Estrada was driving around a U-Haul truck trying to find gas before she turned the vehicle back in. She had to return the truck with a full tank or the company would charge her.

“This is the fourth gas station I have come to with no luck of getting gas. I have to fill up the tank in order to turn it in and now I’m going to have to pay U-Haul in order for them to fill up the tank themselves"" Estrada said.

The mission is clear for the Brazil National Team that will play in Qatar 2022: to avoid at all costs equaling their record of the most years without winning a FIFA World Cup. The Confederation will provide Neymar Jr. and Co. with every possible weapon to prevent this from happening.

After winning their first World Cup in Sweden 1958 Brazil established a healthy habit of winning the tournament continuously until after Pele's success at Mexico 1970 they went 24 years without winning the World Cup trophy again. Thanks to Dunga Bebeto and Romario they won USA 1994.

Then came Korea-Japan 2002 which made the Canarinha the National Team with the most titles in the history of the FIFA World Cup. Qatar 2022 is off to a good start for Neymar Jr. and company as they will have at their disposal a Team Base Camp that will live up to their footballing reputation. The first step has been taken.

Brazil's Team Base Camp at Qatar 2022: their hotel

The team led by Adenor Leonardo Bacchi Tite will stay for the entire duration of the upcoming FIFA World Cup i.e. at least 15 days at the Westin Doha Hotel & Spa operated by the Marriott International chain. Obviously the time the Canarinha occupies the hotel will not be open to any guests.

Brazil is one of more than 20 teams whose Base Camps at Qatar 2022 will be within 10 kilometers of each other. While their privacy being only 4 kilometers from downtown Doha will not be much it is a fact that they will enjoy the luxury that the Westin Doha Hotel offers them.

For starters its location will allow Neymar and company not to spend too much time in their displacements. Whether to their training camp or to the stadiums where they have already scheduled their matches against Serbia Switzerland and Cameroon from November 24 to December 2.

-Westin Doha Hotel to Al Arabi Sports Club - 4 kilometers

-Westin Doha Hotel to Lusail Stadium (Brazil vs Serbia / vs Cameroon) - 22 kilometers

-Westin Doha Hotel to Stadium 974 (Brazil vs Switzerland) - 8 kilometers

Regarding the amenities offered by the Westin Doha Hotel which has 364 rooms Brazil can enjoy a private artificial beach to relax after intense efforts high-end gym three swimming pools (one of them covered) terraces large gardens massage center steam room and sauna.

Brazil's training camp during the FIFA World Cup

While luxury and comfort is important for a top National Team like Brazil another key to sporting success is training. In this sense the Canarinha will be relatively close to the field where Tité will be fine-tuning the team's strategy in order to reach the top in Qatar 2022.

Brazil will use the Gran Hamad Stadium as its training venue for the duration of its participation in the upcoming FIFA World Cup. This 13000-seat venue has a traditional grass pitch and was inaugurated in 1952.

This traditional stadium which did not make the final list of venues for Qatar 2022 because it was overtaken by the modernity of those chosen is usually the home of Al-Arabi Sports Club the third winningest team in the history of the Qatari League an honor it shares with Al-Gharafa and Al-Duhail.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd2lsbGlhbXNvbnNvdXJjZS5jb20vd2d1LW5hbWVzLWluYXVndXJhbC1kaXN0aW5ndWlzaGVkLWFsdW1uaS1jb3VuY2lsLWluLXNvdXRoZWFzdC1yZWdpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WGU Names Inaugural Distinguished Alumni Council In Southeast Region,"The council will be made up of 11 impactful leaders across the region

China is making an unrelenting effort to integrate and upgrade its rare earth supply chain of upstream mining processing manufacturing and deeper applications. Although it has only about one-third of the world’s rare earth reserves China now accounts for 60% of global rare earth mined production 85% of rare earth processing capacity and over 90% of high-strength rare earth permanent magnets manufactured.

In short China aims to transform itself from the largest producer and refiner of rare earth elements to being the world’s major high value-add manufacturer of the clean energy products dependent on rare earth metals and other critical minerals.

The Key Ingredient of the New Economy

Rare earth elements form an integral part of the modern global economy. Rare earth elements play a critical role in developing new industries such as wind power generation fuel cells hydrogen storage and rechargeable batteries as well as the permanent magnets used in electric and hybrid-electric vehicles.

They are also used as phosphors in many consumer displays and lighting systems and are vital for many defense technologies including precision-guided munitions targeting lasers communications systems airframes and aerospace engines radar systems optical equipment sonar and electronic counter measures.

Of the 17 rare earth elements neodymium praseodymium dysprosium and terbium are especially in demand given their use in permanent magnets for electric vehicles and wind turbines.

Demand for rare earth elements has been increasing rapidly in recent years. According to the U.S. Geological Survey the global output of rare earth elements in 2021 was about 280000 metric tons more than doubling the global output five years ago in 2016 and was five times the amount produced thirty years ago. From 1994 to 2008 China’s share of the global output rose from 47% to 97%.

Though available abundantly rare earth elements often are not found in high concentration. And they are usually found mixed together with one another or with radioactive elements such as uranium and thorium. The chemical properties of rare earth elements are such that it can be difficult to separate them from surrounding materials and from one another and also difficult to purify.

The process of mining separating and purifying rare earth elements is not only highly labor intensive but can also if not managed well have adverse health effects and cause lasting degradations to the natural environment. Current production methods require a lot of ore and generate a great deal of harmful waste to extract just small amounts of rare earth metals. Waste from the processing methods include radioactive water toxic fluorine and acids.

Disorderly Development

Behind the headline of China becoming the dominant player in the global rare earth market was that the domestic industry was plagued with disorderly development and poor management. Persistent issues of smuggling and illegal mining activities environmental damage due to poor mining practice and the growing challenge of ensuring its own domestic needs of rare earth run against the central government’s policy perspective that “rare earths are strategic non-renewable resources.”

With the latest consolidation the entire rare earth industry in China is now under two mega-conglomerates one in the north and the other in the south.

The government introduced a series of measures to overcome these problems. Unfortunately some of the measures (e.g. export taxes and export quotas) that the Chinese government chose to deal with the domestic problems may have been too blunt and China was challenged as violating its WTO protocols.

With the booming industry and the associated issues of low prices illegal producers market disorder and environmental pollution the central government began to realize the importance of rare earth minerals their corresponding strategic value and the urgency of addressing these issues. In the early 1990s China started to restrict foreign investment especially in the upstream sector.

However the problem of illegal mining and smuggling has persisted for many years into the second decade of the 21st century. The natural resource–rich areas generally are less developed economically compared to the east-coast provinces. Economic growth is still the first priority of local governments even when the policymakers in Beijing considered policy transformation. In 2012 the city of Ganzhou in Jiangxi province needed $5.8 billion solely for land reclamation not to mention health costs and other environmental pollution.

Industrial Consolidation

Late last year three of the previous six companies were merged to form the China Rare Earth Group Co. an industrial conglomerate that holds almost 70% of China’s annual heavy rare earth production quota. With the latest consolidation the entire rare earth industry in China (especially upstream and midstream) is now under two mega-conglomerates one in the north and the other in the south.

Industrial consolidation serves multiple objectives. First this is part of China’s efforts to boost cost competitiveness increase production efficiency and strengthen its grip over pricing. Second it is seen as a way to curtail illegal rare earths exports and an opportunity to implement and enforce better environmental standards for the industry.

Third with consolidation China is also empowering these large conglomerates to go global. The latter is important as China faces the increasing need to import rare earths products for feeding mid- and down-stream sectors.

As a further measure the central government has arranged to include two R&D companies in the new consolidated group to strengthen the power of domestic innovation in the rare earth industry. Innovation and technological advancements will define the future product and process innovations of China’s rare earth industry.

As of now China is able to produce only about half of the high-performance magnets that go into EVs and wind turbines. Japan and Germany account for the remaining high-performance magnets with Japan’s Hitachi Metals owning most of the patents for advanced sintered NdFeB magnets. But these figures are likely to change.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Visa and MasterCard announced Thursday that they will no longer allow their cards to be used to pay for ads on pornography websites hosted by MindGeek which includes Pornhub.

This decision comes after a federal judge said last week that a case could continue against Visa and Pornhub for their profiting off videos portraying child pornography rejecting a motion for dismissal.

Serena Fleites the plaintiff in the case sued MindGeek and Visa after her attempts to get Pornhub to remove an explicit video made of her when she was 13 years old which her ex-boyfriend then uploaded to the website. Fleites said MindGeek was slow to remove the video even after she contacted them with proof that it contained child pornography. In that time the video proliferated.

Fleites later attempted suicide and developed a drug addiction according to her complaint.

In his decision Judge Cormac Carney said the case was “simple.”

“Visa made the decision to continue to recognize MindGeek as a merchant despite its alleged knowledge that MindGeek monetized child porn” he wrote.

Despite the good news Dawn Hawkins CEO of the National Center on Sexual Exploitation said Visa and MasterCard still have work to do before her group will claim victory.

“The reality is that both of them are still processing payments for other sites where users can upload content” she said.

The larger problem is that there are still no laws on the books requiring companies like Pornhub to get meaningful consent from potential victims before a video is posted or a way for victims to hold businesses accountable if they are exploited Hawkins said.

MindGeek told The Washington Post it had “zero tolerance for the posting of illegal content on its platforms.”

Visa released a statement Thursday saying that it disagreed with the judge’s decision to allow the case to continue but that it also condemns “sex trafficking sexual exploitation and child sexual abuse.”

“It is illegal and Visa does not permit the use of our network for illegal activity” the statement continues. “Our rules explicitly and unequivocally prohibit the use of our products to pay for content that depicts nonconsensual sexual behavior or child sexual abuse.”

In a statement to the Deseret News a MasterCard spokesman said the company has “zero tolerance for illegal activity on our network.”

“We work closely with law enforcement and organizations like the National and International Center for Missing and Exploited Children to monitor detect and prevent illegal transactions” he said. “Beyond our own monitoring when we receive referrals or allegations we investigate the claims. If the claims are substantiated we take immediate action.”

Hawkins said Visa and other credit card companies have not yet successfully stopped the use of their cards on pornography websites alleged to contain nonconsensual content. In a statement the National Center on Sexual Exploitation called on Visa to cut ties with Pornhub’s competitors who face allegations that they also allow users to upload videos of child sexual abuse and of individuals who have been filmed without their consent.

Visa MasterCard and other financial services firms may continue to make decisions to cut ties with businesses like MindGeek voluntarily especially as the spotlight on their involvement with the porn industry grows.

Fleites’ case against Visa was highlighted last weekend by billionaire Bill Ackman who said on CNBC that he was willing to fund lawsuits against Visa saying his interest in the case comes from “having four daughters.”

Victims of sex trafficking have also filed lawsuits against technology companies like Twitter who they say haven’t done enough to rid their platforms of images depicting child sexual abuse and nonconsenual pornography.

Hawkins said her group will continue to file lawsuits to try to protect children who have been exploited online.

“The pornography industry child sexual abuse sex trafficking all merged online. They aren’t separate industries” she said. “Many people think pornography is harmless but this shows it is not harmless.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vYXUucGNtYWcuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLTMvOTU0ODYvdmlzYS10by1zdG9wLXByb2Nlc3NpbmctcGF5bWVudHMtZm9yLXBvcm5odWJzLWFkdmVydGlzaW5nLWFybdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Visa Mastercard to Stop Processing Payments for Pornhub's Advertising Arm,"UPDATE 8/5: Mastercard will also stop accepting payments for Pornhub's advertising arm TrafficJunky.

""New facts from last week’s court ruling made us aware of advertising revenue outside of our view that appears to provide Pornhub with indirect funding. This step will further enforce our December 2020 decision to terminate the use of our products on that site"" Mastercard said.

""We have zero tolerance for illegal activity on our network. We will continue to follow this case and take further action as necessary"" the company added.

Original story 8/4:In a blow to Pornhub Visa has decided to stop accepting payments for the adult video site’s advertising arm TrafficJunky.

In December 2020 both Visa and Mastercard suspended their credit card services with Pornhub after the site was found to be circulating child porn and sex-trafficking videos. The company is now expanding the suspension to cover TrafficJunky in response to a lawsuit that claims Visa enabled Pornhub to profit off the child porn videos.

“Accordingly we will suspend TrafficJunky’s Visa acceptance privileges based on the court’s decision until further notice” said Visa CEO Alfred Kelly in a Thursday statement. In addition the suspension covers any affiliated advertising services with MindGeek Pornhub’s parent company.

However Visa is making one exemption to the suspension. ""Visa can be used only at MindGeek studio sites that feature adult professional actors in legal adult entertainment” Kelly said.

Pornhub and MindGeek didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But the Visa suspension could further crater the company’s business. Currently Pornhub only accepts payments via bank transfer and cryptocurrency making it more of hassle for users to pay for Pornhub Premium.

Kelly announced the new suspension after a US court denied the company’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit which alleges Visa continued to process payments for Pornhub even though it was aware of the child pornography over the site. The lawsuit comes from Serena Fleites who was 13 when a sexual explicit video of her was made by a boyfriend and posted on Pornhub.

It could take years before the court reaches a final verdict on the case. But in the meantime Visa “strongly disagrees” with the judge’s decision to deny the case’s dismissal Kelly said. “In our view our company’s role policies and practices have been mischaracterized. The allegations in this lawsuit are repugnant and stand in direct contradiction to Visa’s values and purpose” he added.

The company also plans on sharing its side of the controversy through evidence in court. “We look forward to shining a light onto the lengths Visa goes to ensure the integrity of our people and network” Visa’s CEO said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5haHJhbS5vcmcuZWcvTmV3cy80NzI3NzIuYXNweNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,64% of Egyptian increased their use of digital payment solutions surpassing global rate: Mastercard - Tech - Business,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://english.ahram.org.eg/News/472772.aspx on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5haHJhbS5vcmcuZWcvTmV3cy80NzI3NzIuYXNweNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

These can be disruptive and frustrating for players. But for pros whose careers are on the line these bugs can be soul crushing.

In the LJL (League of Legends Japan League) a glitch related to the Hexflash rune instantly respawning players caused a pause in a match between Detonation FocusMe and SengokuGaming the #1 and #2 teams in the LJL respectively.

This game was very important when it came to how each team would be seeded in the playoffs and the outcome of the match would have massive repercussions for either team.

From game-breaking to chronobreaking

Sengoku’s jungler Jang ‘Once’ Se-young was using the Hexflash rune and respawned immediately after dying due to the bug.

In the above clip you can see Once die in mid lane and then immediately respawn on the minimap.

What many thought would be a brief pause turned into an almost two hour long wait to get back into the game. Except the game being played between both teams no longer existed.

Detonation FocusMe had a massive lead

The lead DFM accrued was almost insurmountable for Sengoku at the time of the pause and DFM’s victory was all but assured. However for the sake of maintaining competitive integrity and keeping the game completely fair for both sides the game had to be remade.

Not for lack of effort from the team behind the LJL either. Administrators attempted to Chronobreak a failsafe that essentially resets the entire game up to the point of the pause and attempts to restore the exact same game state prior to the bug’s occurrence.

Unfortunately for DFM Chronobreak attempts weren’t able to fix the issue with Hexflash and the entire game had to be remade.

Sengoku used what they learned from the prior game and wound up winning their game against DFM a match result that likely wouldn’t have come about if it weren’t for the full remake.

A tough loss

Many of DFM’s players took to twitter after the result to talk about their concerns with League of Legends’ competitive integrity.

Of particular note is DFM’s mid laner Lee ‘Yaharong’ Chan-ju a veteran player who asked in a twitter thread what would happen if a bug like this occurred during the Finals of a World Championship. He also raised some concern about his career and the stability of League of Legends as an esport.

Detonation FocusMe is a beloved organization internationally with many players on the current roster representing Japan at international events and winning against some of the best teams in the world.

MKC,McCormick & Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3RydW1wLWJhY2tlZC1zZW5hdGUtaG9wZWZ1bC1kYXZlLW1jY29ybWljay1oYXMtZXh0ZW5zaXZlLWRlZXAtc3RhdGUtdGllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump-Backed Senate Hopeful Dave McCormick Has Extensive 'Deep State' Ties,"As he runs for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania Dave McCormick’s claims to his “home state” have been a source of contention on the campaign trail: the Republican hedge fund titan spent much of his youth in Pennsylvania but has lived out most of his recent adult and professional days in Connecticut.

While the extent of McCormick’s ties to his “home state” are cloudy his ties to another state—the “deep state”—seem far more clear.

Despite his claims to the MAGA movement McCormick is steeped in the nexus of government intelligence and big business that Donald Trump and his acolytes ambiguously refer to as “the deep state.”

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick’s firm—the legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates—that was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick’s most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get—such as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund’s president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater’s “in-house inquisitor.”

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick’s “deep state” affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel—quite literally the Central Intelligence Agency’s very own venture capital firm.

McCormick’s role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity’s name as “IQT.” Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he’s already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump’s endorsement—losing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year—though there weren’t any other viable Republicans running in the primary—the dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick’s challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick’s at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was “an honorable man” a “stand-up guy” and an “independent” and “brilliant leader.” But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a “sad reality” that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

“He knows that if he wins he won’t get to do what he thinks is right” the person said. “He has his own money and he won’t be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he’s still going to have to kiss the ring and that’s unfortunate.”

McCormick’s campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It’s not clear if Trump knew about McCormick’s work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick’s 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010—the year after McCormick left George W. Bush’s Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater’s president—Bridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump’s paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey’s role more closely resembled that of an “in-house inquisitor” over the first iteration of the firm’s oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called “The Politburo.”

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called “radical transparency.” Those efforts included constant surveillance—including recorded meetings and videotaped internal “trials” of employees—with Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was “like a godfather adjudicating it all.”

The taped meetings were “just the tip of the surveillance ecosystem” at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey’s time with the firm.

“A slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver” Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey’s security posse only turned up “little evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own” according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive’s binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio’s extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his “radical transparency” dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party’s social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP’s own “Politburo” and compared it favorably to “Big Brother” in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater’s internal culture “reflects aspects of Chinese political ideology” and invested heavily in the region—after McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund’s Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The “Politburo” staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it “intimidating” and “humiliating” and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like “auditors” and “overseers” and recording practically every moment of activity—all in pursuit of Dalio’s core “radical transparency” philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees—including Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio—McCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Rubinstein quit after a “firing squad” meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio’s increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a “climate of fear.” When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein’s take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program—“radical transparency” within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny—he replied that he “doesn’t think it’s inconsistent at all.”

“Ray has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we’re not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example” McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs “almost all investment decisions” by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy—and whose fate was “rescued” by IQT’s investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund’s pursuit of Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick’s 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT’s current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money—more than $150000—behind McCormick’s candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it’s true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn’t stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick’s political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scoop: McCormick PAC launches big ad buy in Pennsylvania Senate race,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2024/05/08/mccormick-pac-ad-pennsylvania-senate-casey on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcmdhbmZoLm5ldC9vYml0dWFyeS9qb3NoLW1jY29ybWlja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary | Josh McCormick of Huntington West Virginia,"LEWISBURG WV - Joshua Howard McCormick 38 of Huntington WV formerly of Lewisburg WV passed away May 3 2024 at home.

Hoopers and fans can purchase the shoes for $140 on the Adidas website and other select retailers. Sneakerheads considering making the purchase should act fast as the Adidas Trae Young 1 has sold out quickly in most colorways.

While Young never wore these exact shoes on the court he did trot out over 25 colorways during the 2021-22 NBA season. The vast majority of them eventually enjoyed general release treatment to the credit of Adidas.

It will not be long before Young's second signature sneaker the Adidas Trae Young 2 starts flooding everyone's timelines. So let's hope the three stripes release a few more colorways of the Adidas Trae Young 1 before closing the book on the legendary hoop shoe.

(A screenshot from a McDonald's ad.) Chris Matyszczyk/Screenshot

Fast food companies like McDonald's are doing quite well thank you very much.

Except for inflation and the lack of human beings who want to work at McDonald's that is.

There's another aspect though that brings more than a frisson of discomfort to Big Mac customers' innards.

It's the thought that McDonald's will soon be no more than a cold-hearted vending machine there to dispense burgers and dispense with smiles and humanity.

The company is already rigorously testing robot drive-thru ordering. It's giving the impression that machines are a better way to make customers happy than are humans.

It verged on the staggering therefore when McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski was asked just how far the company's robotic ambitions might stretch.

On McDonald's second-quarter earnings call an ever-alert analyst from an ever-inert bank asked this studious question: ""Are there any capital or technology type of investments in coming years that could allow you to reduce your demand for labor while increasing overall customer service?""

You have to admire the philosophical emphases here. It posits the mere notion that robots can and will offer better customer service than humans.

Oddly Kempczinksi countered with an equally philosophical response: ""The idea of robots and all those things while it maybe is great for garnering headlines it's not practical in the vast majority of restaurants.""

It isn't? But we were all girding our loins for more conversations with a Siri-type robot at the drive-thru which might elicit just as much misunderstanding as a conversation with Siri at home. And then there was the glorious idea of robots flipping our burgers to perfection.

That isn't going to happen? You're not thinking this could be a money thing are you?

Well Kempczinski added: ""The economics don't pencil out you don't necessarily have the footprint and there's a lot of infrastructure investments that you need to do around your utility around your HVAC systems. You're not going to see that as a broad-based solution anytime soon.""

Do I hear a hosanna or two? Do I sense a sigh of longing for continued interactions with humans who may not have left high school but really do want to make sure you get the right innards in your Big Mac?

Kempczinski conceded there was an increased role in technology.

Also: McDonald's and Chick-fil-A both have a big problem. Only one has a solution

He mused: ""There are things that you can do around systems and technology especially taking advantage of all of this data that you're collecting around customers that I think can make the job easier things like scheduling as an example ordering as another example that will ultimately help reduce some of the labor demand in the restaurant.""

His ultimate solution however will lift the hearts minds and perhaps even eyebrows of everyone clinging to the notion that humanity still has a chance.

""We've got to kind of get after this the old-fashioned way which is just making sure we're a great employer and offering our crew a great experience when they come into the restaurants"" he said.

Well I never. What a turn-up. Can you believe that robots can't replace humans because they're too expensive? Can you believe that some corporations realize they have to become wonderful employers or no one will want to work for them?

I do adore hope. I think I'll go to McDonald's and hope the ice cream machine is working.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL21jZG9uYWxkcy1icmluZ3MtYmFjay1hLWJlbG92ZWQtYnJlYWtmYXN0LWNsYXNzaWPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's Brings Back a Beloved Breakfast Classic,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/mcdonalds-brings-back-a-beloved-breakfast-classic on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL21jZG9uYWxkcy1icmluZ3MtYmFjay1hLWJlbG92ZWQtYnJlYWtmYXN0LWNsYXNzaWPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWNrZWQuY29tL2ltYWdlLXBpY3RvZmFjdC05MDM5LTE1LWltcHJlc3NpdmVseS1ldmlsLXRoaW5ncy1tY2RvbmFsZHMtaGFzLWRvbmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,15 Impressively Evil Things McDonald's Has Done,"As children enjoy this list of interesting facts we should like to remind them that the facts contained within are real.

Special to The Desert Sun

Scratched through the hot sand the road was much wanted by the ranchers and farmers of Edom. Named for the biblical desert by the Southern Pacific Railroad Edom was a depot stop along its Yuma line in the late 19th century. The name seemed appropriate for the inhospitable seemingly empty land. For decades Edom consisted only of the depot and a few outbuildings in its surround. It would become a tiny outpost of a few hearty pioneers with some unusual settlement ideas.

In 1904 according to Bob Spence writing for the Chamber of Commerce two homesteaders arrived: Ned McKesson who created a citrus ranch around a new artesian well just north of the depot and August Strelow who located a date garden and ranch a bit to the west. These two settlements became dual and competing focal points for development.

But citrus and date farming weren’t the only ideas of imaginative developers. Cultivating spineless cactus for cattle to consume was in the offing according to the Riverside Daily Press in 1913.

“A new industry is being started in the Coachella valley at the Southern California Home Builders town of Edom. A syndicate has acquired a tract of 1120 acres near Edom and has begun planting it to spineless cactus of the Burbank variety. It is believed by the men interested that the soil and climate of that section are especially adapted to the raising of spineless cactus and the entire tract will be utilized for that purpose. The successful outcome of this new enterprise will it is stated open up a vast territory for profit and the outcome of the Edom cactus plantation will be watched with interest by stock men. In addition to the development work on this new tract at Edom work is being rushed on the planting of the big alfalfa tract for the Southern California Home Builders. The work of seeding to alfalfa is nearly complete and soon the water will be turned into the five miles of cement irrigating pipe which has been constructed and laid on the tract. With the development of these two big tracts and other improvements in sight for the near future Edom is fast becoming an important factor in the development of the great Coachella valley.”

Edom continued to grow in small increments and by varied ideas but remained isolated from the village of Palm Springs to the west and the town of Indio to the east.

As early as 1912 the State of California decided to build State Highway 99 connecting Los Angeles to San Bernardino and Calexico. In 1922 it included roads from Whitewater through Edom to Indio. But a connection from Edom to the village of Palm Springs would wait until the late 1930s.

The Desert Sun reported in November 1937: “Edom road improvement boosters recently graded three miles of an eight-mile road between Edom and Palm Springs. As soon as the entire stretch has been leveled it will be oiled and put in shape for travel. This work will in all probability be finished by spring!”

Completed by 1940 the road was named in honor of Miguel Ramon the Agua Caliente Tribal Chief. Ramon was a good choice for the pivotal roadway. He was known for his fierce advocacy for indigenous rights and for always wearing a Stetson 10-gallon hat. (The idea of a 10-gallon hat was initiated by painter Lon Megargee whose illustration adorned the satin lining of nearly all Stetson hats made since 1924. Titled “The Last Drop From His Stetson” the image depicts a cowboy offering his thirsty horse water from his upturned hat.)

With the connection made by Ramon Road Edom began to prosper. Travelers supported small restaurants motels service stations and local produce shops. Saturday night dances were held at Desert Moon Guest Ranch home of the Hyde sisters. In 1946 a Sunday school began that later grew into a community church. A debate about where the new post office and elementary school would be located sometimes became antagonistic as proponents of each of dual settlements along the tracks vied for superiority.

Importantly the original desert rat Harry Oliver moved in a bit down the highway and began publishing a newspaper that would be read around the world. In October 1948 Oliver reported on a singularly defining piece of news in the history of the Edom with a headline reading “Something New.”

The story elaborated: “Edom Station Bows Out as Thousand Palms Comes in. Edom is no more — Thousand Palms is. That is according to the Southern Pacific and boosters of the Thousand Palms area eight miles eastward out Ramon road. This week H. R. Gernreich Superintendent T. F. Frizzell freight traffic manager and George Hanson passenger traffic manager of the Southern Pacific visited the community where Ramon Road crosses Highway 99 and officially watched while the depot sign ‘Edom’ came down and the new sign ‘Thousand Palms’ went up. Mary Dickey and Norma Roberson of Thousand Palms officiated at the sign changing. They didn't do the actual manual labor but lent color by posing with the sign. Following that there was a Thousand Palms chamber of commerce banquet at Charley Doyle's Hidden Springs ranch at which speeches extolled the virtues of the resort and its position as the hub of the rapidly growing desert resort country.”

Edom was officially gone renamed into oblivion. According to Spence just after World War II “developer Charley Doyle had begun subdividing about 1500 acres of desert land on Ramon Road three miles east of the highway. He extended an existing well and tapped into an ‘underground hot water vein from the nearby San Andreas fault.’ After establishing the water supply he and the Hyde sisters and other old-timers prevailed on the postmaster to change the name of the area from Edom which they felt connoted wicked images of Esau selling his birthright for a hot meal to Thousand Palms as it was already unofficially known.”

The roadside community continued to grow until 1957 when President Eisenhower’s Interstate Freeway was built between Highway 99 and the railroad tracks. The freeway bypassed the existing businesses on the old highway (since renamed Varner Road) and the cross-streets accessing old Edom were no longer traveled. Further accessing the freeway was nothing short of dangerous. In 1962 a proper overpass was built at Ramon and Interstate 10 but in the intervening years the once thriving businesses along Highway 99 had been decimated.

Ramon Road though the aspiration of the early inhabitants of Edom would become a major thoroughfare and retail hub of the desert.

The property was last listed in April 2020 for $1.25 million and sold for $1.1 million in October 2020. It is now available at $1.59 million.

Built in 1936 to resemble a medieval castle it was originally the residence of Robert Musica who lived under the alias Robert Dietrich and collaborated with two of his brothers in the notorious 1938 financial swindle involving the pharmaceutical company McKesson & Robbins.

The home was bought in the early 1940s by industrialist David Trompeter and his wife opera singer Lisa Roma and in 1962 it was acquired by the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth as a convent and administrative building. The nuns left the property in 2006 and the property was unoccupied until 2013 when developer John Kimball acquired it.

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

WhatsApp is already widely popular with U.S. consumers. Now Meta Platforms is turning more attention to building its small business base.

The Facebook parent company launched WhatsApp Business in 2018 with free simple tools to help small businesses keep in touch with customers offering a way for them to directly interact search for products and indicate purchasing interest.

Soon the company will roll out a premium service to small businesses and it's doubling down on a newer advertising format called ""click-to-message"" which allows consumers to click on a company's ad within Facebook or Instagram and directly start a conversation with that business on Messenger Instagram or WhatsApp.

These initiatives offer Meta the ability to boost advertising revenue stay relevant with small businesses and gain incremental revenue from the premium services offered analysts said.

Keeping more inside the Meta universe

Meta (then Facebook) bought WhatsApp in October 2014 for around $22 billion. Since then industry watchers have been watching closely for signs the company plans to monetize the platform more. That time could now be coming.

""If I stay on any of the Meta properties and I'm communicating using Meta asking questions and buying — all within the platform — there is no signal loss and it's easier for Meta to tell the brand its return-on-advertising spend"" said Mark Kelley managing director and senior equity research analyst at Stifel. ""Signal loss is really what's been impacting social media companies this year.""

WhatsApp will be the ""next chapter"" in the company's history Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently told CNBC's Jim Cramer. He noted that the company's ""playbook over time"" has been to build services to serve a wide audience and ""scale the monetization"" after reaching that goal. ""And we've done that with Facebook and Instagram. WhatsApp is really going to be the next chapter with business messaging and commerce being a big thing there"" he said.

This messaging from Meta comes at a time of transition for the company and uncertainty among investors. The company recently reported an earnings and revenue miss and forecast a second straight quarter of declining sales. Meta Platforms shares have lost roughly half their value this year. Mark Zuckerberg is betting large sums of money currently at a loss on a future in which the metaverse will be a growth driver for the company. But with his bet on the metaverse as far as a decade out before coming to fruition the Meta CEO has stressed that in the short-term it is WhatsApp that is among the initiatives to focus on for growth.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzA3L21ldGEtZmFjZXMtbGF3c3VpdHMtb3Zlci10ZWVuLXN1aWNpZGVzLWFuZC1zZWxmLWhhcm0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meta faces lawsuits over teen suicides and self-harm,"Meta is facing a fresh storm of lawsuits that blame Instagram for eating disorders depression and even suicides among children and teens — and experts say the suits are using a novel argument that could pose a threat to Mark Zuckerberg’s social-media empire.

The suits — which are full of disturbing stories of teens being barraged by Instagram posts promoting anorexia self-harm and suicide — rely heavily on leaks by whistleblower Frances Haugen who last year exposed internal Meta documents showing that Instagram makes body image issues and other mental health problems worse for many teens.

The leaks provide proof that Meta was well aware its products were hurting children but chose to put growth and profits over safety the suits claim. Some of the suits also name Snapchat and TikTok which the plaintiffs argue have also pushed addictive products despite knowing the deadly downsides.

“In what universe can a company have a product that directs this kind of vile filth this dangerous content to kids — and get away with it?” said Matthew Bergman the founder of the Social Media Victims Law Center which has filed more than a half-dozen of the lawsuits. “These products are causing grievous harm to our kids.”

Section 230

Bergman faces an uphill battle due to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act a law that has largely protected social-media companies from similar litigation. But Bergman also has a novel legal strategy based on Haugen’s leaks that the families he represents hope will force Meta to change its ways.

Meta and other tech companies have fought off lawsuits for years using Section 230 which was intended to preserve internet users’ free speech by preventing web platforms from being held legally liable for content posted by third parties.

But Bergman argues that the problem with Instagram is not just that third parties post harmful content on the app — it’s that Instagram’s design can intentionally route vulnerable users toward such content as detailed by Haugen’s leaks. Therefore he argues the company shouldn’t be protected by Section 230.

“It’s our belief that when you attack the platform as a product that’s different than Section 230” Bergman said. “230 has been a barrier and it’s something we take seriously and we believe we have a viable legal theory to get around it.”

Meta did not return a request for comment.

Self-harm addiction and death

One suit centers around a Louisiana girl named Englyn Roberts who committed suicide in 2020 at age 14.

According to the suit filed in July in San Francisco federal court Roberts’ parents had no idea the extent to which she was quietly being “bombarded by Instagram Snapchat and TikTok with harmful images and videos” including “violent and disturbing content glorifying self-harm and suicide.”

The more Roberts allegedly interacted with such photos and videos the more the apps recommended similar content that kept her hooked in a vicious cycle. Roberts started exchanging self-harm videos with her friends including one disturbing video in September 2019 of a woman hanging herself with an extension cord from a door according to screenshots included in court papers.

4 Englyn Roberts who committed suicide at age 14 was allegedly barraged by “violent and disturbing content glorifying self-harm and suicide” on Instagram.

4 Roberts became addicted to Instagram after she was given her first cellphone at 11 years old her parents say.

In August 2020 Roberts appeared to imitate the video when she used an extension cord to hang herself from the door. Her parents found her hours later and she was rushed to the hospital. She was put on life support and died days later.

About a year after Roberts’ death her father saw a report about Frances Haugen’s leaks about Instagram’s harms. He subsequently searched his daughter’s old phones and social media accounts and uncovered her posts and messages about suicide.

“What became clear in September of 2021 is that Englyn’s death was the proximate result of psychic injury caused by her addictive use of Instagram Snapchat and TikTok” the suit reads.

This maneuver around Section 230 means “Meta should be worried” according to a recent analysis of one of Bergman’s suits by Gonzaga School of Law Professor Wayne Unger.

“The reasons for Section 230 immunity fall flat with respect to Spence’s lawsuit” Unger wrote. “If the primary beneficiary of Section 230 protection is the internet user then it follows that platforms should not be allowed to use Section 230 immunity for the harms the platforms directly cause their users.”

‘Knowingly releasing a toxin’

Bergman previously represented Asbestos victims before switching to social media lawsuits last year in the wake of Haugen’s testimony.

“To me that was basically everything I’ve seen in the asbestos industry times one hundred” Bergman said of Haugen’s leaks. “Both [asbestos producers and Meta] were knowingly releasing a toxin.”

Other alleged victims of social media represented by Bergman’s firm include two other teens from Louisiana and another from Wisconsin who all committed suicide after being hooked on social media apps.

An additional disturbing suit filed by a Connecticut mother alleges that her daughter killed herself at just 11 years old after becoming addicted to social media apps and being barraged by sexually explicit videos from strangers. The pre-teen girl even made a video of herself taking the pills that killed her the suit claims.

Other suits have been filed by victims who are still alive but who say they have suffered from severe anorexia mental trauma and other harms harm due to their social media use.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA4LzA2L3ByZWRpY3Rpb24tdGhlc2Utd2lsbC1iZS0xMC1sYXJnZXN0LXN0b2Nrcy1ieS0yMDMwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Prediction: These Will Be the 10 Largest Stocks by 2030,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.fool.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /investing/2022/08/06/prediction-these-will-be-10-largest-stocks-by-2030/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D831D5870>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA4LzA2L3ByZWRpY3Rpb24tdGhlc2Utd2lsbC1iZS0xMC1sYXJnZXN0LXN0b2Nrcy1ieS0yMDMwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdWsubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9maW5hbmNlL25ld3Mvc3RvY2stYnV5YmFja3MtaGl0LXJlY29yZC1sZXZlbHMtMDkwMDAwNTA4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stock buybacks have hit record levels this year but they're about to get hit by taxes.

The Democrats plan to introduce a 1% tax on stock buybacks as part of Joe Biden's climate and tax bill.

S&P 500 companies spent over $280 billion buying back their own shares in the most recent quarter.

Stock buybacks tend to be bullish for investor sentiment because they show a company has faith in itself.

The Democrats are set to introduce a 1% tax on stock buybacks as part of President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act.

The tax - which has been supported in the past by high-profile Democrats including Senator Elizabeth Warren - is unlikely to be welcomed by investors.

A buyback is when a company repurchases its own shares in the marketplace. It returns money to investors by boosting the company's stock price while also boosting key performance metrics such as earnings per share.

Mega-cap companies including Apple and Facebook parent Meta Platforms have been major proponents of stock buybacks in recent years.

And the top 20 S&P 500 companies spent a record $118 billion buying back their own shares in the first quarter of 2022 up 70% from the same quarter in 2021 according to index data. Over the last five years that number rises to a staggering $1.24 trillion.

He saw the people in the parking lots dressed in LT Eli and Saquon jerseys and allowed himself a momentary break from the daily grind.

He was the head coach of the New York Giants about to lead an NFL team into an NFL stadium for the first time.

“Just driving in and seeing the fan base out here and you’re like ‘It’s a pretty cool history and a humbling moment for me to be in this position’” Daboll told The Post. “To see all the fans out there for the first time knowing that you’re their head coach and then to stand on the sideline — yeah it was a bunch of firsts. Even thought it was just a practice a bunch of firsts.”

It might be silly to attach any significance to a Blue-White scrimmage that doubled as a Fan Fest at MetLife. Some 26000 people gathered to watch Daniel Jones do some good and some not-so-good things against his own defense and maybe half of those fans were just looking for something to do while letting the traffic ease up before their late-night drives to the Shore.

But they showed up to watch something fairly meaningless that was pretty damn meaningful to their rookie head coach. At 47 Daboll had never run a team on any level. He started out as a volunteer assistant at William & Mary and worked his way onto the staffs of Bill Belichick and Nick Saban before riding his success as Bills offensive coordinator into the big job with the Giants.

Brian Daboll stands on the MetLife Stadium sideline for the first time as Giants head coach. Robert Sabo for the NY POST

“I’ve done this for 25 years” he said in June “so it’s not like I was a coach for five years and got on a hot swing. This is 25 years in the making a lot of good ups and some downs that you learn from. A lot of ‘nos’ a lot of not getting jobs. So every day I thank my lucky stars that … I’m the head coach of a football team let alone the New York Football Giants. What an honor that is.”

And that honor made a mark on him before this intrasquad scrimmage. After he was done coaching on the field and fielding questions in the press conference room Daboll was walking down the MetLife corridor when asked if the occasion meant anything to him. He paused and appeared on the verge of getting emotional.

“It’s hard to put into words” he told The Post. “It was a different feeling walking into the stadium for the first time as a head coach walking into the head coach’s office instead of a big room with the assistants. I kind of sat there before the scrimmage. It’s humbling. It’s very humbling. I understand the role and I just want to do a really good job for our organization and for our fan base.

“But it was certainly a pretty cool moment for me.”

Nobody knows how Daboll will be as a head coach just as nobody knew how another rookie Joe Judge would be the first time around. Judge was not a disaster — he just authored his own disastrous ending. But even an amateur detective could scan recent quotes from the holdover Judge players and determine that they prefer (so far) the way Daboll is running this operation from his energy to his methods of communication to the freedom he’s giving his outside playmakers to you know make plays.

Brian Daboll Robert Sabo for the NY POST

One Giants source with deep long-standing ties to the organization said “The whole building loves Daboll.” Asked if it seemed the majority of veteran Giants are making it clear that they appreciate Daboll’s management style to Judge’s the source said: “One hundred percent. They’re not making any attempt to hide that.”

Tyrod Taylor a 12-year veteran who wasn’t a Judge player but who has seen a ton of coaches come and go said Daboll has impressed him every day with his command of the locker room and meeting rooms and with the way he has earned the team’s respect.

“He does a great job of keeping everyone involved but also not withholding information” Taylor said. “He’s straightforward with us.”

Of course that player connection won’t matter if it doesn’t show up on the scoreboard. Given that the Giants have lost 10 or more games in five straight seasons Daboll clearly has to teach his team how to win. In order to do that he said he has tried to create an ultracompetitive environment in every aspect of his program “whether that’s in the cafeteria at the walk through in the locker room. Everything’s about competition. … We’re committed to a process of trying to improve and do things a certain way.”

Coaches get so locked into that process that they don’t often break away and appreciate the small things for the big things they really are. But Friday night during an early August drive that didn’t even cover a mile and in the short time he spent in the head coach’s office before a Fan Fest scrimmage Brian Daboll allowed himself to feel something he’d never felt in his football life.

That should be noted … just in case he becomes the next Tom Coughlin or Bill Parcells.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5qLmNvbS9saXZlLWVudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvMjAyMi8wOC9sYWR5LWdhZ2EtdG91ci0yMDIyLXdoZXJlLXRvLWJ1eS10aWNrZXRzLXNjaGVkdWxlLWRhdGVzLWZvci1jaHJvbWF0aWNhLWJhbGwuaHRtbNIBjQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uai5jb20vbGl2ZS1lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LzIwMjIvMDgvbGFkeS1nYWdhLXRvdXItMjAyMi13aGVyZS10by1idXktdGlja2V0cy1zY2hlZHVsZS1kYXRlcy1mb3ItY2hyb21hdGljYS1iYWxsLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lady Gaga tour 2022: Where to buy tickets schedule dates for ‘Chromatica Ball’,"Lady Gaga is about to embark on the U.S. portion of her “Chromatica Ball” World Tour which takes place at several stadiums across the globe.

The New York Jets held their annual Green & White Scrimmage at MetLife Stadium on Saturday night. It featured periods of 7-on-7s scripted 11-on-11s and unscripted 11-on-11s.

Fans in attendance witnessed a competitive practice featuring plenty of highlight-reel moments from both the offense and defense. After a red-hot start by the offense the defense began ruling the night in its latter half.

Even though the offense eventually fizzled out it was still a largely successful night for quarterback Zach Wilson. The second-year passer appeared confident and decisive as he did a great job of getting the football out quickly and delivering it into tight windows. It was night-and-day from his performance in this same setting exactly one year ago when he threw multiple interceptions and struggled mightily to get the offense moving.

Let’s get into some highlights.

Wilson throws a dart to Braxton Berrios on a curl route from the opposite hash. Berrios is blanketed by slot cornerback Michael Carter II but Wilson puts it in the perfect spot with exquisite timing.

From an overall team perspective there is no better sight to see in practice than reps like that one where the coverage is great but the pass and catch are even better.

Next Wilson rolls out and makes the correct decision to target Jeff Smith who is the deepest of three options on Wilson’s side. Wilson puts it on the numbers but Smith drops it. (Maybe it’s a tad behind although that feels like nitpicking especially with the receiver bearing down on the sideline. Catch the ball.)

Tyler Conklin was arguably the best player of the night on either side of the ball. He made one catch after the next flaunting his smooth route-running and soft hands. Here Conklin lines up in the slot and beats Jordan Whitehead man-to-man on a quick slant. Wilson threads the needle for a touchdown.

This time Wilson hits Conklin up the seam.

In a two-minute drill Wilson first hit Corey Davis over the middle for a nice gain to get things going. Wilson then tried to hit Davis over the middle once more placing the ball nicely between a crowd of zone defenders but Davis dropped it.

That pass might look like it was a bit behind Davis. In actuality it’s great placement by the QB as described by Jets X-Factor’s Robby Sabo (who had a view from the press box at MetLife).

Second and 15 Zach Wilson *appropriately* throws ""behind"" C.Davis in a situation where he makes sure to NOT lead him into the FS. Excellent throw reading the DBs' leverage. Davis drops it. Gotta have that for a huge 15-20-yard chunk and first down with under 40 seconds. #Jets — Robby Sabo (@RobbySabo) August 7 2022

The low point of Wilson’s night was an interception to Del’Shawn Phillips. Wilson tries to hit C.J. Uzomah on an out route from the opposite hash but fails to recognize Phillips dropping from the A-gap into a hook/curl zone.

This one falls incomplete but Wilson nearly connects with Garrett Wilson on a deep bomb. Sauce Gardner‘s lengthy frame makes it too tight of a window for the Wilsons to notch the completion.

Gardner flashed multiple times with exciting reps in coverage. On this rep Gardner hangs with Elijah Moore on a deep route forcing an incompletion.

There are not many 6-foot-3 corners who can stick with a 5-foot-10 wide receiver like that.

The Jets closed things out on a high note as they welcomed 7-year-old fan AJ onto the field to run a play. AJ took a red-zone handoff from Zach Wilson out of the shotgun and showed outstanding patience and power as he let the blocks develop before bulldozing his way into the end zone for a game-winning touchdown. Tyler Conklin’s block led the way.

Speaking to the media after the game head coach Robert Saleh was impressed with Wilson’s performance.

“I really thought he was really good” Saleh said. “He dropped a dime over a buzz defender’s head … had a really good strike there in the two-minute drive I think it was to Corey [Davis]. He moved around in the pocket found some open lanes to run in buy some time. He was really good in the huddle; [I was] just standing back there and listening to him. Good with cadence because he was changing up his cadence. So I thought he was really good.”

Try a Trip to Vegas,"What’s highly resistant to 40-year high inflation and malingering COVID-19 (and now monkey pox) fears? The idea of winning money of course explaining the 2022 boom in casino gambling.

With cryptocurrencies in tatters after months of hammering by pessimists (and possibly realists) those who bet big on bitcoin have watched those wagers weaken from a high of $68000 last November with TIME’s Next Advisor reporting Thursday (Aug. 4) that “the most extreme crypto skeptics say bitcoin will tank to as low as $10000 in 2022.”

Oddsmakers called it early on with USBookies.com saying late last year that “bitcoin (BTC) has 4-1 odds to reach $50000 by Sept. 22 (20% implied probability) according to betting aggregators. The odds bitcoin falls below $10000 by this time are 10-1 (9.1%).”

While you can still amuse yourself with 10 grand of crypto in Sin City indications everywhere from Monte Carlo to Macao are that more folks are opting for slots and table games of chance perhaps leaving crypto speculation to “the experts” and going for more familiar get-rich-quick schemes.

There is a rosy glow around Las Vegas this year and it isn’t the gels on stage lights behind that Elvis impersonator. The Strip is back to minting money even amid a broader economic grind.

“Despite inflation at a four-decade high and jitters over a looming recession people are flocking to the entertainment and gambling oasis” The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Thursday. “Executives with Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts International this week reported record-high performances for their Las Vegas properties in the latest quarter.”

For added color WSJ noted: “In June Nevada gambling revenue was about $1.3 billion the 16th month in a row that gambling revenue exceeded a billion dollars according to state regulators.”

Celebrity Cage Match: Casinos Versus Crypto

Sounding as giddy as any casino chief ever does on an earnings call with analysts Wednesday (Aug. 3) MGM Resorts International CEO Bill Hornbuckle said: “Our second-quarter results represented our highest adjusted property EBITDAR quarter in the history of Las Vegas both on an absolute and same-store basis and the highest second quarter in our regionals ever with seven of our U.S. properties setting all-time records.”

Put another way: To hell with inflation and monkey pox — place your bets.

Not that crypto is on the outs. Resorts World Las Vegas the $4.3 billion gaming palace built on the site of the beloved Stardust property and the first major casino added to the Strip in over 10 years made a deal with Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss-led crypto exchange Gemini last year.

Those of us who weep for billionaires sobbed inwardly when Fortune reported in May that “Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss co-founders of rival crypto exchange Gemini have each lost about $2.2 billion — or roughly 40% — of their wealth this year.”

It’s heartbreaking what’s happened to the Winklevoss twins — as if their infamous Facebook imbroglio wasn’t bad enough — but we have a feeling that the plucky pair will be OK.

Over on the gambling island of Macao — possibly neighboring the island where “Westworld” is situated — they’ve shut down everything except casinos.

“City officials have begun closing schools tourist attractions cultural venues and all non-essential businesses” CNN reported in June. “Restaurants have been ordered to suspend dine-in services. Casinos have been allowed to remain open however analysts say their bottom line will still be hit as the government has urged residents not to visit entertainment venues.”

Adding that “Macao’s government relies on casinos for more than 80% of its income with most of the population employed directly or indirectly by the casino industry” it’s easy to understand why schools are closed but betting parlors are not.

Some of Colorado’s key technology sectors will reap benefits from the $280 billion CHIPS and Science Act recently passed by Congress and expected to be signed into law by President Joe Biden on Tuesday.

But how big that impact will be remains unknown and will vary by industry and — in some cases — will depend on future congressional appropriations.

The U.S. Senate passed the measure by a 64-33 vote July 27 with the U.S. House of Representatives following suit the next day 243-187.

A local experienced solar installer will help you navigate the complexities of commercial solar to achieve financial success for your project.

Much of the attention surrounding the CHIPS Act — formally called the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science Act — focuses on the semiconductor sector with $52 billion going toward semiconductor research and development and a 25% advanced manufacturing investment tax credit for expansion of manufacturing capacity for semiconductors or semiconductor manufacturing equipment.

But the Act also includes hundreds of billions of dollars in spending authorizations — Congress still must appropropriate the funds in the future — to support other science-based industries including:

A five-year authorization of $81 billion for the National Science Foundation including $20 billion for the NSF’s Directorate for Technology Innovation and Partnerships.

A five-year authorization of about $10 billion for the National Institute of Standards and Technology potentially doubling the budget of the federal laboratory. Boulder hosts one of two NIST campuses nationwide.

$15 billion to upgrade infrastructure at Department of Energy federal laboratories such as the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden.

Authorizes $100 million per year to support quantum-network infrastructure and requires establishment of a Quantum User Expansion for Science and Technology program or QUEST to encourage access to quantum-computing hardware and clouds for research purposes

Other provisions would increase spending for research in fusion energy biology the environment and other scientific disciplines.

Semiconductors dominate bill

National-security concerns and critical supply-chain shortages propelled funding to boost the semiconductor sector with actual appropriations rather than just spending authorizations.

“Semiconductors are the 21st century’s Space Race we must win” Colorado Sen. John Hickenlooper said in a prepared statement after Senate passage. “Relying on foreign-made semiconductors makes us vulnerable to higher prices and potentially being cut off. This bill will reinvigorate American manufacturing lower costs and create more good-paying jobs.”

Hickenlooper presided over the Senate vote to pass the bill and helped write the bill as part of the Senate Committee on Commerce Science and Transportation. He also served on the Conference Committee to reconcile differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill.

Congressional passage occurred after years of debate hand-wringing and concerns over the loss of U.S. competitiveness in semiconductor manufacturing especially compared with increased Chinese investment in the sector.

Semiconductors are used in every electronic device from cars to cell phones military hardware to medical devices computers to clean-tech equipment.

The Semiconductor Industry Association estimates that the U.S. share of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity has dropped from 37% in 1990 to 12% today. Much of that capacity resides in East Asia including China and Taiwan.

“The U.S. in terms of semiconductor production has fallen behind and that is mainly due to the fact of not [having] a coordinated effort to attract semiconductor manufacturing from a strategic federal level and has kind of left it up to the states — for Texas or Arizona or Colorado or California to compete with countries like Taiwan China Japan South Korea” said Jim Feldhan founder and president of Semico Research Corp. a Phoenix-based semiconductor marketing and consulting research company. “And it hasn’t been a very effective strategy.”

Feldhan noted that the bill — though “not a drop in the bucket” — remains far below what China is investing in the semiconductor industry estimated at $150 billion.

But the CHIPS Act does represent a significant change in U.S. policy he said.

“It’s a dramatic change to the U.S. government to pass a bill where they really are trying to support the industry because for so many years it was just not on the priority list” he said with semiconductor manufacturing substantially more affordable in Asia.

Department of Defense officials long have argued for increasing U.S. semiconductor-manufacturing capabilities for national-security reasons. Semiconductors are used in all major U.S. defense systems and foreign production raises concerns not only about supply chains but also about potential “backdoors” that can be inserted into chips allowing them to be reprogrammed or shut off.

Additionally the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting supply-chain disruptions have prompted government and private-sector companies to rethink the “just-in-time” global supply-chain model whereby goods arrive from suppliers only when needed.

“The pandemic has really solidified the idea that semiconductors are actually a strategic commodity and are needed for our own security and health of our overall economy” Feldhan said adding that companies have found that keeping an inventory. “may not be a bad idea.”

Add in “saber-rattling” between the U.S. and China over Taiwan and U.S. support for the semiconductor industry makes strategic sense he said.

“If something happened to Taiwan it would be a disaster not only for our economy but the whole world in terms of the semiconductor industry” he said.

And the semiconductor industry sees an opportunity in the CHIPS Act. Online technology publication Protocol recently estimated that chip-makers spent $100 million on lobbying for the bill and other measures over several years.

What about Colorado?

The Semiconductor Industry Association ranks Colorado No. 16 in the country in terms of semiconductor manufacturing jobs at 2900 and No. 17 in terms of semiconductor establishments at 29. Colorado exports about $840 million in semiconductors annually according to the SIA.

Colorado’s semiconductor industry includes companies engaged in chip design as well as two manufacturing centers:

Broadcom Inc. (Nasdaq: AVGO) operates a wafer-manufacturing facility in Fort Collins. The company told BizWest in 2019 that it employed 1747 locally including 1313 employees and 434 contingent workers.

Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) based in Chandler Arizona employs about 700 at a semiconductor manufacturing plant in Colorado Springs and in January announced a $40 million retooling project at the plant.

It’s unknown whether Broadcom will seek to expand its fab facility in Fort Collins to take advantage of the CHIPS Act. Broadcom officials did not return requests for comment.

Northern Colorado and the Boulder area also host many research and design centers for semiconductors and other storage devices including:

Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC) employs 350 workers at its Fort Collins Design Center 4701 Technology Parkway.

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (Nasdaq: AMD) operates at 2950 E. Harmony Road in Fort Collins across Ziegler Road from Broadcom and kitty-corner from Intel.

Micron Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MU) employs an estimated 250 at a Longmont facility developing advanced-memory and semiconductor technologies.

Qualcomm Inc. (Nasdaq: QCOM) maintains a hub in Boulder’s Gunbarrel area.

Rivos Inc. a Mountain View California-based stealth-mode startup has leased about 4500 square feet at 2950 E. Harmony Road in Fort Collins — in the same building that houses AMD.

Michelle Hadwiger director of global business development for the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade said the bulk of the CHIPS funds likely will go toward other states for expansion of fab facilities.

“What I think the CHIPS Act will do is primarily benefit the large fab facilities in areas like Ohio where Intel is making significant investments” she said “and for Colorado it will be more research-and-development-oriented and buildout of smaller fabrication facilities.

“I do think that Colorado does have some pockets of investment opportunities but I think the largest sum of money of the $52 billion package will go to the larger fab facilities” she added.

Colorado does enjoy a robust sector for semiconductor R&D she noted with ties to legacy industries such as telecommunications medical devices battery technology information technology and other sectors.

“I think Colorado’s competitive advantage is really in those legacy companies that know what they’re doing have a lot of market share but aren’t going to be doing the large fab but are going to be niche innovation and technology driven at the level of precision that goes into multiple industry sectors versus just being a mass-production type of play” she said.

Boosting quantum research

One key technology that receives a significant boost in the CHIPS and Science Act is quantum computing which uses quantum mechanics to solve problems far faster than classical computers.

Colorado — especially Boulder and Broomfield counties — has become a hub for the sector with Honeywell International Inc. (Nasdaq: HON) spinoff Quantinuum LLC in Broomfield ColdQuanta Inc. in Boulder and a robust quantum program at the University of Colorado Boulder among other quantum operations.

Tony Uttley president and chief operating officer for Quantinuum said the CHIPS Act represents a big step forward for the quantum industry.

“At a high level what has been included is an understanding that this technology is going to be as transformative as it is and a realization that there needs to be funding that is supporting the rapid development of this technology” he said.

Uttley said inclusion of quantum computing in the CHIPS Act makes sense given that quantum computing requires both classical computations — and therefore semiconductor chips — and quantum computations at the same time.

Quantum computing was included in the CHIPS Act as one of the key technology focus areas for the NSF’s Directorate for Technology Innovation and Partnerships helping spur commercialization of the technology from laboratories to the marketplace.

But Uttley said he is most excited about the QUEST program — for which he personally advocated — and which essentially sets the federal government up as a customer of the quantum industry.

“The U.S. government is in almost every sector one of the biggest customers. It hasn’t been in quantum computing” Uttley said.

Up until now he said the government has unintentionally competed with private quantum companies.

“When it comes to quantum computing particularly at this stage in its evolution it all comes down to nouns: people places things” he said. “If you’re going to put in a place fine but if you start going after people and things which means all the materials you now have become directly competitive with all of these other companies that have spent all of this time trying to build up these incredible teams and build up these incredible systems.

“It was inadvertent” he added. “It was not an intentional ‘trying to be disruptive to the ecosystem’ but it was.”

The CHIPS Act — and specifically the QUEST program — set a different course with the U.S. government working with private quantum companies including buying time on quantum computers.

“So you’ve had all of these companies like Quantinuum who have really done all of the hard work and research in building these quantum computers and there’s a missing piece of being able to have all of these various parts of the government get access to those quantum computers that already exist and understand how they work and how to advantage of them and how to plan for their eventual inclusion into the systems and processes that exist today” Uttley said. ”There was just a flat-out gap and this really goes a long way to trying to close that gap.”

Small manufacturers left out

But not everyone is enamored with the CHIPS Act. Edmond Johnson president and owner of Premier Manufacturing Inc. in Frederick said the bill includes no provisions that will benefit his sector contract manufacturing of printed circuit boards.

“Nothing to my knowledge is coming here [to Colorado] out of that bill” Johnson said “In addition what’s in it for small manufacturing? I don’t see anything that’s really in it.”

He noted that semiconductor companies for years shifted manufacturing jobs overseas rather than investing in the U.S.

“I’m an onshore guy” he said.

Johnson said he’s much more enthusiastic about clean-tech provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act now moving through the Senate for approval.

Premier which has about 70 employees has an arrangement pending to manufacture electric-vehicle batteries for a company in Michigan and also has its own proprietary software product for solar energy.

“That has broader appeal to us” Johnson said speaking of the clean-tech provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act. “It will give a chance to migrate into something from a manufacturing standpoint across the board that is new technology. I think there is going to be a genuine emphasis on keeping that here. Whatever we create keep it here.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMDQvYnVzaW5lc3MvamFwYW4tc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3RvcnMtY2hpcHMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Japan Once Led the World in Microchips. Now It's Racing to Catch Up. (Published 2022),"TOKYO — It was the spring of 2021 and demand for new cars was spiking. But as consumers flush with savings amassed during the pandemic rushed to dealerships around the world one Japanese automaker after another idled production as they waited for imports of a critical component: semiconductors.

Coronavirus outbreaks had shut down chip plants and an unanticipated surge in demand for electronics from people riding out the pandemic at home had constrained supplies. Nissan alone predicted a cut in output of half a million vehicles.

The chip shortfall — a blow to “the head” of Japan’s economy in the words of Yoshihiro Seki a lawmaker who leads a study group on semiconductors — woke up the country to the fragility of the supply chains that undergird its most important industries.

That has driven a broad reconsideration of how Japan can protect its economy the world’s third largest against both unforeseen economic shocks like the pandemic and looming risks like the rising tensions between the United States and China. Those risks were highlighted this week as the House speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan prompting an angry response from China.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9lY29ub215LXBvbGljeS9tZWl0eS1sb29rcy10by10d2Vhay10aGUtcGxpLXNjaGVtZS1mb3ItdG9wLWl0LWhhcmR3YXJlLWNvbXBhbmllcy0xMjIwODA1MDE2NzRfMS5odG1s0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzLXN0YW5kYXJkLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9lY29ub215LXBvbGljeS9tZWl0eS1sb29rcy10by10d2Vhay10aGUtcGxpLXNjaGVtZS1mb3ItdG9wLWl0LWhhcmR3YXJlLWNvbXBhbmllcy0xMjIwODA1MDE2NzRfMS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meity looks to tweak the PLI scheme for top IT hardware companies,"As part of these talks MeitY is planning to rework the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for IT hardware to incorporate some of these companies’ requirements and make it relatively attractive for them

Micron's 24 Gbps GDDR6X Memory Enter Mass Production Coming To NVIDIA's Next-Gen GPUs Later This Year

Micron announced earlier this year that they were readying their brand new 24 Gbps GDDR6X memory modules for future graphics cards. The announcement came at a time when NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3090 Ti had just entered the market for which Micron had produced 16 Gb DRAM modules rated at up to 21 Gbps speeds.

Now Micron is going to offer even faster pin speeds of 24 Gbps in a 16 Gb density which means that once again we will be looking at 2 GB VRAM capacities and up to 24 GB capacities across a 384-bit bus interface. Just like the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti which featured all of its memory modules on the front of the PCB the next-gen GeForce RTX 4090 would feature its 12 GDDR6X modules on the front allowing for more cooling compared to solutions that feature memory modules on the back of the PCB such as the RTX 3090 (Non-Ti).

Although the full 24 Gbps speeds aren't expected to be utilized by the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 (rumored to offer up to 21 Gbps die speeds) the 24 Gbps GDDR6X memory modules can offer up to 1.152 TB/s of bandwidth which is an increase of 14% versus the 1.008 TB/s offered on current 21 Gbps GDDR6 memory modules.

Micron has commenced mass production of its 24 Gbps GDDR6X memory modules for NVIDIA Next-Gen GPUs. (Image Credits: Harukaze5719)

Following are the bandwidth numbers you can expect with a 24 Gbps DRAM solution:

512-bit solution - 1.5 TB/s

1.5 TB/s 384-bit solution - 1.1 TB/s

1.1 TB/s 320-bit solution - 960 GB/s

960 GB/s 256-bit solution - 768 GB/s

768 GB/s 192-bit solution - 576 GB/s

576 GB/s 128-bit solution - 384 GB/s

384 GB/s 92-bit solution - 276 GB/s

276 GB/s 64-bit solution - 192 GB/s

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 is going to be amongst the first next-gen graphics card to utilize the latest GDDR6X memory modules when it launches later this year. Given that these chips are likely going to be downclocked to hit the power targets there will be a huge overclocking potential for enthusiasts to take advantage of.

AMD on the other hand is likely to depend on its partner Samsung for its next-gen RDNA 3 lineup. Samsung is also working on a 24 Gbps GDDR6 memory module which is expected to hit mass production soon.

“I think Colorado’s competitive advantage is really in those legacy companies that know what they’re doing have a lot of market share but aren’t going to be doing the large fab but are going to be niche innovation and technology driven at the level of precision that goes into multiple industry sectors versus just being a mass-production type of play” she said.

Boosting quantum research

One key technology that receives a significant boost in the CHIPS and Science Act is quantum computing which uses quantum mechanics to solve problems far faster than classical computers.

Colorado — especially Boulder and Broomfield counties — has become a hub for the sector with Honeywell International Inc. (Nasdaq: HON) spinoff Quantinuum LLC in Broomfield ColdQuanta Inc. in Boulder and a robust quantum program at the University of Colorado Boulder among other quantum operations.

Tony Uttley president and chief operating officer for Quantinuum said the CHIPS Act represents a big step forward for the quantum industry.

“At a high level what has been included is an understanding that this technology is going to be as transformative as it is and a realization that there needs to be funding that is supporting the rapid development of this technology” he said.

Uttley said inclusion of quantum computing in the CHIPS Act makes sense given that quantum computing requires both classical computations — and therefore semiconductor chips — and quantum computations at the same time.

Quantum computing was included in the CHIPS Act as one of the key technology focus areas for the NSF’s Directorate for Technology Innovation and Partnerships helping spur commercialization of the technology from laboratories to the marketplace.

But Uttley said he is most excited about the QUEST program — for which he personally advocated — and which essentially sets the federal government up as a customer of the quantum industry.

“The U.S. government is in almost every sector one of the biggest customers. It hasn’t been in quantum computing” Uttley said.

Up until now he said the government has unintentionally competed with private quantum companies.

“When it comes to quantum computing particularly at this stage in its evolution it all comes down to nouns: people places things” he said. “If you’re going to put in a place fine but if you start going after people and things which means all the materials you now have become directly competitive with all of these other companies that have spent all of this time trying to build up these incredible teams and build up these incredible systems.

“It was inadvertent” he added. “It was not an intentional ‘trying to be disruptive to the ecosystem’ but it was.”

The CHIPS Act — and specifically the QUEST program — set a different course with the U.S. government working with private quantum companies including buying time on quantum computers.

“So you’ve had all of these companies like Quantinuum who have really done all of the hard work and research in building these quantum computers and there’s a missing piece of being able to have all of these various parts of the government get access to those quantum computers that already exist and understand how they work and how to advantage of them and how to plan for their eventual inclusion into the systems and processes that exist today” Uttley said. ”There was just a flat-out gap and this really goes a long way to trying to close that gap.”

Small manufacturers left out

But not everyone is enamored with the CHIPS Act. Edmond Johnson president and owner of Premier Manufacturing Inc. in Frederick said the bill includes no provisions that will benefit his sector contract manufacturing of printed circuit boards.

“Nothing to my knowledge is coming here [to Colorado] out of that bill” Johnson said “In addition what’s in it for small manufacturing? I don’t see anything that’s really in it.”

He noted that semiconductor companies for years shifted manufacturing jobs overseas rather than investing in the U.S.

“I’m an onshore guy” he said.

Johnson said he’s much more enthusiastic about clean-tech provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act now moving through the Senate for approval.

Premier which has about 70 employees has an arrangement pending to manufacture electric-vehicle batteries for a company in Michigan and also has its own proprietary software product for solar energy.

“That has broader appeal to us” Johnson said speaking of the clean-tech provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act. “It will give a chance to migrate into something from a manufacturing standpoint across the board that is new technology. I think there is going to be a genuine emphasis on keeping that here. Whatever we create keep it here.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L2xhdGVzdC1uZXdzL2lzLWl0LXdvcnRoLWludmVzdGluZy1pbi1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLXN0b2Nrc9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L2FtcC9zdG9yeS9sYXRlc3QtbmV3cy9pcy1pdC13b3J0aC1pbnZlc3RpbmctaW4tc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3Rvci1zdG9ja3M?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is it Worth Investing in Semiconductor Stocks?,Category 3.

On August 6 1997 Microsoft's Bill Gate invested $150 million in Apple which was in the brink of bankruptcy. Following the deal Steve Jobs told Gates “Bill thank you. The world’s a better place.”

At the time Time Magazine used the quote on their cover.

The show of friendship between rivals shocked the tech and business communities. Describing it the New York Times wrote in its opinion section: “Even in cyberspace the moment can only be described as surreal.""

“Apple was in very serious trouble” CNBC quoted Steve Jobs as saying. “And what was really clear was that if the game was a zero-sum game where for Apple to win Microsoft had to lose then Apple was going to lose.

“There were too many people at Apple and in the Apple ecosystem playing (that) game” he added. “And it was clear that you didn’t have to play that game because Apple wasn’t going to beat Microsoft. Apple didn’t have to beat Microsoft. Apple had to remember who Apple was because they’d forgotten who Apple was.”

The investment meant that Microsoft was helping one of its greatest competitors but it was also a new business opportunity which Bill Gates admitted in 2007.

“That’s worked out very well"" he had said. “In fact every couple years or so there’s been something new that we’ve been able to do on the Mac and it’s been a great business for us.”

The event begins with the Leone d’Argento The event begins with the Leone d’Argento Rocío Molina  a figure of great importance in the Flamenco tradition a dance that moves from the Andalusian gipsy culture therefore from the Roma tradition. People without a homeland have always been present in the arts just consider the Buenaventura or Caravaggio’s Bari.

""He is literally one of the most important flamenco artists. It brings something meaningful and precious to flamenco and puts it at its core. We consider Rocio Molina to be one of the most important artists in our country and not only for flamenco.



I first heard about her from José Luis Ortiz Nuevo: ""There's a girl in Malaga who does not just dance well she's an artist."" Rocío Molina's work soon entered the space that Israel Galván had opened to flamenco since Los Zapatos Rojos. The word revolution is too much a publicity stunt too much a cry of alarm if you like. I prefer to talk about metamorphosis I don't know like the one that Enrique Morente or Camarón de la Isla produce in flamenco at a given moment.



It's not just about singing. They are groundbreaking and change the parameters rules and even emotions in the art experience in the experience of flamenco once and for all. Rocío Molina by instinct and intelligence immediately accessed this territory and took it to new levels. Very early. The way in which he gave knowledge to his body and from his body to flamenco occurred from the very beginning. The appearance of Rocio Molina in this new territory is a sort of an epiphany...""

The awarding of the Leone d’Oro to The awarding of the Leone d’Oro to Saburo Teshigawara on behalf of both the President and the Director follows.

The director in motivating the award says: ""Brave extraordinary sensitive and electrifying Saburo Teshigawara has inspired challenged and galvanized many generations of artists. Teshigawara's sharp sculptural sensibility his powerful sense of choreographic forms and his very personal language coalesce to create a world that peculiarly is his. His practice spans a wide range of disciplines from theater to visual arts from film/video to the set design lighting and costumes for all of his shows.



It is his ability to build entire artistic ecosystems alongside his inexhaustible courage to unlearn that makes him unique compared to other artists.



Teshigawara grasps the power of a body in constant transformation and is determined to expand the potential of choreography beyond traditional limits. His pioneering attitude his incomparable technique and his mastery of means result in works that cross borders by sliding across genres.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsdW5pdmVyc28uY29tL25vdGljaWFzL2ludGVybmFjaW9uYWwvbG9zLTEwLWhvbWJyZXMtbWFzLXJpY29zLWRlLWxhLWhpc3RvcmlhLWRlbC1tdW5kby1ub3RhL9IBeGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsdW5pdmVyc28uY29tL25vdGljaWFzL2ludGVybmFjaW9uYWwvbG9zLTEwLWhvbWJyZXMtbWFzLXJpY29zLWRlLWxhLWhpc3RvcmlhLWRlbC1tdW5kby1ub3RhLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Los millonarios de la era moderna no están ni cerca de los del pasado; estos son los 10 hombres más ricos de la historia,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsdW5pdmVyc28uY29tL25vdGljaWFzL2ludGVybmFjaW9uYWwvbG9zLTEwLWhvbWJyZXMtbWFzLXJpY29zLWRlLWxhLWhpc3RvcmlhLWRlbC1tdW5kby1ub3RhL9IBeGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsdW5pdmVyc28uY29tL25vdGljaWFzL2ludGVybmFjaW9uYWwvbG9zLTEwLWhvbWJyZXMtbWFzLXJpY29zLWRlLWxhLWhpc3RvcmlhLWRlbC1tdW5kby1ub3RhLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D840BF0A0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsdW5pdmVyc28uY29tL25vdGljaWFzL2ludGVybmFjaW9uYWwvbG9zLTEwLWhvbWJyZXMtbWFzLXJpY29zLWRlLWxhLWhpc3RvcmlhLWRlbC1tdW5kby1ub3RhL9IBeGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsdW5pdmVyc28uY29tL25vdGljaWFzL2ludGVybmFjaW9uYWwvbG9zLTEwLWhvbWJyZXMtbWFzLXJpY29zLWRlLWxhLWhpc3RvcmlhLWRlbC1tdW5kby1ub3RhLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcmF6b24uZXMvY3VsdHVyYS8yMDIyMDgwNy83ZWo3ZjcyZmc1ZGNiaGJhNWVjaWlrYm9wYS5odG1s0gFWaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGFyYXpvbi5lcy9jdWx0dXJhLzIwMjIwODA3LzdlajdmNzJmZzVkY2JoYmE1ZWNpaWtib3BhLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Los estoicos frente a la batalla cultural moderna,"Dos ingenieros escribiendo sobre filosofía podría ser el inicio de algún viejo chiste o de una apuesta. Pero qué va: es todo un hallazgo. Javier G. Recuenco y Guillermo de Haro han alumbrado una pequeña joya que bien podría ser un manual de instrucciones para sobrevivir en estos tiempos líquidos versión posmoderna y versada de aquella «Guía de supervivencia Zombie» de Mel Brooks en formato moleskine para la vida moderna. Un detente bala contra los juicios apresurados las simplificaciones interesadas y las decisiones atolondradas. «Los principios estoicos» nos explican en la introducción de su ya indispensable «El pequeño libro de la filosofía estoica» «se basan en percibir adecuadamente actuar correctamente y desarrollar la voluntad de aceptar y tolerar lo que sucede». Imagina que todos lo intentásemos.

«Llevábamos un tiempo trabajando en un libro de resolución de problemas complejos» explica Guillermo de Haro ingeniero en telecomunicaciones profesor universitario y articulista «que es una disciplina en la que Javier G. Recuenco es referente en el mundo de habla hispana y que además ahora está muy de moda. Esta disciplina bebe de muchas fuentes entre ellas la toma de decisiones la falacia y los sesgos. Y le presentamos el proyecto al editor Roger Domingo. Ese planteamiento inicial por distintos motivos evoluciona hasta convertirse en “El Pequeño libro de la filosofía estoica”. Nos dimos cuenta de que hay un montón de aspectos de la toma de decisiones que llevamos aplicando y enseñando durante mucho tiempo y que están muy relacionadas con el estoicismo». «Hubo un momento» tercia Javier G. Recuenco ingeniero y profesor también experto en personotecnia «en que pensamos en titularlo Estoicismo para CEOS. Y es que como cada vez que vuelve el estoicismo las cosas se están poniendo peliagudas y las decisiones a tomar son cada vez más complicadas. Pero no encajaba demasiado en la colección. Lo que teníamos claro es que el ángulo filosófico estaba ya más que cubierto y no es nuestra formación. El ángulo de la autoayuda también y no nos veíamos demasiado en ese registro. Pero vimos que realmente había una posibilidad de utilidad práctica aplicable además a contextos profesionales».

«Descubrimos entonces» prosigue Guillermo «que el estoicismo es una disciplina práctica y bastante maleable que vuelve cíclicamente en determinados momentos adaptándose a las situaciones y necesidades del contexto concreto del momento pero que hay una base que siempre se mantiene». «La clave –añade De Haro– es que el estoicismo siempre vuelve porque llega un momento en que se necesitan sus herramientas prácticas para enfrentarse a este entorno cíclico. Cuando hablamos de los ciclos nos referimos a los ciclos históricos. Saber que la historia se repite y no poder hacer nada puede llegar a ser desesperante. Y aquí entra el estoicismo».

Para De Haro cualquier tiempo pasado no fue mejor solo anterior. «La gran diferencia y la suerte de nuestro siglo» dice «es que al aumentar la esperanza de vida podemos hablar con nuestros mayores tenemos mucha gente mayor a nuestro alrededor. Y estas personas nos pueden contar no ya lo que ocurrió que ya nos lo cuentan los libros sino cómo lo vivieron ellos cómo se sintieron las personas en ese momento. Esa información es muy valiosa y nos puede ser de mucha utilidad. Yo recomiendo mucho hablar con la gente mayor porque nos estamos perdiendo sobre todo cómo ellos se sintieron».

La historia ignorada

Y pese a eso pese a que sabemos que las cosas ya han pasado se ignoran los ciclos se ignoran los patrones se ignora la historia. Parece el adanismo un signo del momento. «Es parte del pack para poder creerse uno el alfa y el omega de la civilización un niño Dios el que va a traer el cambio a la humanidad –asegura Javier– pero el estoicismo tan sobrio te pone rápidamente en tu sitio».

«En realidad –añade después– los dos grandes problemas que nos encontramos son la desaparición del hombre de Estado y la irrupción del arte performativo. Del primero ya no encontramos esa persona que tomaba sus decisiones y anteponía el servicio público el interés general a su propio interés personal. Del segundo ahora todo no interesa tanto en su esencia como en su presencia: son los gestos es el teatro la carcamacola… La batalla cultural es completamente performativa y hay quien lo ha entendido perfectamente como Ayuso que ha comprendido que esto es performance. Y claro hay que afrontarla entendiendo por qué el mundo ahora mismo es puramente performativo». «Por eso hay una tendencia mayor a consumir cada vez contenidos más breves –interviene Guillermo– y sería TikTok el ejemplo más aberrante una máquina de generar endorfinazos con un algoritmo muy bien pensado que te muestra rápidamente el contenido que más te gusta. Todo esto genera que cada vez estemos menos acostumbrados a poner contexto a tener perspectiva a evaluar otras ideas y alternativas o ir un paso más allá para intentar entender las cosas. Y esta sería entonces otra pieza más en el puzle en el que nos encontramos: Cuando la mayor parte de la gente toma decisiones de esta manera y una nueva generación viene formada de este modo por el sistema público de educación es cada vez más complicado entenderse decidir convencer negociar… las herramientas convencionales y tradicionales no sirven. Hay que empezar a incorporar nuevas herramientas para hacerse entender para trabajar para negociar para vender para informar… Hemos pasado de “El pensador” al “Sentidor”. Se toman decisiones por impulso y así es más fácil controlar a la gente».

Todo lo contrario de aquello que pretendían los estoicos: «Una de las cosas más importantes de los estoicos –explica De Haro– y de los filósofos en general es que intentaban entender el mundo es decir poner un marco de referencia un contexto. Y ahora te levantas una mañana con la noticia de que la iluminación no genera ningún problema si la quitas por la noche y hace dos o tres años la noticia era que la luz reducía la criminalidad y era imprescindible. Es decir: las sentencias son justas cuando dicen lo que yo quiero pero los jueces son corruptos cuando no dicen lo que yo quiero. En vez de poner un contexto claro un marco de referencia las reglas del juego y después explicárselas a todo el mundo para que en los grises o en los puntos en los que podamos tener divergencia se pueda debatir y discutir vivimos instalados en un «todo lo que yo digo está bien y todo lo que dicen los demás está mal». Esto ha crecido como una bola para terminar generando una sensación generalizada de desazón de hartazgo de impotencia… Salvo que ya estés totalmente polarizado que estés emocionalmente en ese punto de hooliganismo en el que solo te preocupa que tu equipo gane y todo vale todo es justificable». «Se vuelve clave aquello que decía Umberto Eco –apostilla Javier– de los apocalípticos y los integrados. Pero ahora solo hay apocalípticos de un color y de otro. Ahora mismo todo es resignificación revisionismo realineamiento simplificación pop y conseguir que todo encaje acorde a las narrativas que le ayudan a uno a llevar el agua a su molino. Como la del comunismo “cuqui”». Y concluye: «Ojalá te toque vivir tiempos interesantes reza una maldición china. En eso estamos. Con estoicismo y CPS».",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZXMubW90b3IxLmNvbS9uZXdzLzYwMjU3OC9jb21wcmFyLWZ1cmdvbmV0YS1jYW1wZXItYmFyYXRhLWNsYXNpY2EtcHJlY2lvLWNpdHJvZW4v0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly9lcy5tb3RvcjEuY29tL25ld3MvNjAyNTc4L2NvbXByYXItZnVyZ29uZXRhLWNhbXBlci1iYXJhdGEtY2xhc2ljYS1wcmVjaW8tY2l0cm9lbi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Diseño clásico y tecnología moderna en esta increíble camper Citroën,"Aunque lo más socorrido a la hora de viajar en vacaciones tal vez sea recurrir a una furgoneta camper sencilla y barata sin muchos artificios esta nueva moda cada vez nos ofrece más y más posibilidades.

Es el caso de esta Citroën camper que hoy te presentamos y que aunque pueda parecerlo no es una variante restomod de una antigua autoaravana clásica. Más bien todo lo contrario: se trata de una furgoneta Citroën camperizada moderna dotada de un diseño de época.

De hecho podríamos decir que está inspirada en uno de los vehículos comerciales más famosos de todos los tiempos como es la Citroën Type H. Eso sí en este caso pensada para viajar en familia ya que ofrece cuatro camas repartidas en dos literas.

Una camper Citroën moderna con diseño clásico

Centrándonos en la preparación la primera vez que escuchamos hablar de esta Citroën Type H WildCamp fue hace unos cuatro años cuando su llamativa estética 'vintage' nos llamó la atención.

¿Y sabes qué es lo mejor de todo? Que este modelo creado por el especialista Caselani Automobili (que por cierto está preparando un 2CV furgoneta moderno) cuenta con la licencia oficial de la marca. De hecho el modelo toma como base la Citroën Jumper Roadcamp R preparada por Pössl.

Así las cosas hablamos de una autocaravana de dimensiones compactas (algo muy valorado en medio rurales) que además de las mencionadas camas ofrece cocina con dos fuegos fregadero depósito de agua frigorífico y congelador espacio de almacenamiento para los utensilios de cocina...

Por supuesto también hay distintos armarios para guardar la ropa y todo el equipaje y en opción se puede incluir un sistema multimedia firmado por Alpine con una pantalla táctil integrada de 90 pulgadas.

Elementos que se complementan con un motor turbodiésel BlueHDi de unos 160 CV así como con la posibilidad de poder contar con tracción total y un diferencial de deslizamiento limitado como aliados para todos aquellos que quieran abandonar el asfalto con seguridad.

On the front package of the labels the products now will state the percentage of their grains that are whole grains. These percentages are: Ritz Baked with Whole Wheat Crackers (44%) Ritz Baked with Whole Wheat Fresh Stack Crackers (44%) and Premium with Whole Grain Saltine Crackers (34%).

In addition the CSPI said Mondelez has agreed to make the “baked with” and “with” in the claims more prominent (i.e. at least 75% as large as the words “whole wheat” or “whole grain”).

“The labeling changes that Mondelez has agreed to make on its Ritz and Premium whole grain products are a significant step forward” said Lisa Mankofsky litigation director at the CSPI. “This new and improved labeling will help consumers make informed decisions about the grains they consume and enable them to build a diet that meets the 50% whole grain recommendation. We hope that other manufacturers of whole grain products will follow suit.”

The CSPI has been pushing for other manufacturers of products containing some whole grain to make their labels more informative for consumers.

Last year the CSPI said Bimbo Bakeries USA and Flowers Foods Inc. would be changing the labeling on certain bread bagel and muffin products to provide additional information quantifying the product’s whole grain content.

The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend Americans consume half of their grains from whole grain sources and the remainder from enriched grains. The Dietary Guidelines recognize whole grains are “one of the three food groups that are fundamental constituents of a healthy dietary pattern.”

The Dietary Guidelines also maintain the existing recommendation for the average healthy American adult to consume six 1-oz servings of grain foods daily with half of those servings coming from whole grains and for the first time the Dietary Guidelines include recommendations for birth to 2 years.

In order for consumers to make informed decisions about the grains they consume the CSPI said it believes consumers should know the percentage of whole grain content in the grain foods they consume. Simply stating a product is made with whole grains is not enough for consumers to follow recommendations the CSPI said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Energy drinks have grown in popularity and expanded to dozens of brands over the last few decades. These drinks have become increasingly mainstream and are offered by many distributors in various flavors. The major companies such as Red Bull and Monster are well-known for advertisements and appear on many store shelves worldwide. Energy drinks originated in Japan in the 1960s but really caught on in the 1990s when they expanded to the United States according to The New York Times.

Energy drinks contain many ingredients that combine to increase energy usually based on caffeine vitamins and antioxidants such as taurine that provide a ""boost"" to mental and physical power. While these drinks do provide energy (at least temporarily) they may come with health risks. Although caffeine is a drug energy drinks fall between the cracks as they are typically categorized as dietary supplements and conventional foods according to Hospital Pharmacy. In essence the drinks are regulated to a degree but they do not undergo a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process.

Consumers with preexisting conditions or allergies to certain ingredients may also be concerned about what is in energy drinks. One of these pressing concerns regarding energy drinks is whether or not they contain gluten.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyZW5kaHVudGVyLmNvbS90cmVuZHMvZnJ1dGUtYnJ1dGUtbW9uc3Rlci1jZXJlYWzSAUFodHRwczovL3d3dy50cmVuZGh1bnRlci5jb20vYW1wL3RyZW5kcy9mcnV0ZS1icnV0ZS1tb25zdGVyLWNlcmVhbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nostalgia-Inducing Monster Cereals,"General Mills is Bringing Back Frute Brute Monster Cereal

Sportswear tycoon Mike Ashley is pursuing a legal claim against investment bank Morgan Stanley.

The Sports Direct founder's company Frasers alleges the bank acted in 'bad faith' over trades he made to build his stake in fashion giant Hugo Boss which is now worth £770million.

His shares in the German brand are owned through Frasers – and held through a complex series of contracts which put Ashley in overall control of them.

Court documents claim Morgan Stanley 'intended to harm' Frasers by indirectly forcing the firm to transfer Hugo Boss stock options.

The imposed 'margin call' on the shares cost Frasers money and Morgan Stanley action was 'recklessly indifferent' the papers say.

They say attempting to force such a trade was based on the incorrect assumption that Frasers would behave as an 'activist' to agitate for changes at Hugo Boss despite assurances it would not.

Imposing the margin call would have caused 'significant commercial and reputational damage' for Frasers and led to 'unwarranted speculation as to Frasers' financial position' Ashley's lawyers argue.

His group has been linked with a takeover of Hugo Boss but has firmly denied the rumours.

Its products are sold in his Flannels and House of Fraser stores.

Court papers reveal Ashley offered £100million in cash and his entire £1.9 billion Frasers' stake in collateral to avoid the margin call but the eye-watering package was refused.

Frasers was forced to close out or transfer some of his share options in Hugo Boss.

Denmark's Saxo Bank an intermediary through which Frasers built its stake in Hugo Boss has also been listed as a defendant.

A Morgan Stanley spokesman said: 'We believe this claim is contrived and without merit and we will defend it vigorously.'

Frasers Group and Saxo Bank were both contacted for comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vbHV4dXJ5bGF1bmNoZXMuY29tL2NlbGVicml0aWVzL21lZXQtamFyZWQtYmlyY2hhbGwucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet the man Elon Musk turns to for solving his problems - Jared Birchall is the Tesla CEO's 'fixer' and also the architect ...,"

Elon Musk’s empire which includes SpaceX Tesla The Boring Company and Neuralink is worth around US$270 billion so it’s no surprise that he has surrounded himself with key figures who protect his personal and business interests.



The No 1 person by his side Jared Birchall has received plenty of attention in financial circles for his stealthy business mind and ability to solve any problem for his boss. And Musk is a lot to handle. From getting high in public to raising the ire of many for his comments on the declining birth rate in the US and how he is doing his bit to solve the problem (he has nine children) Musk sure keeps his conservative and religious “fixer” busy.



Meet the guy that the world’s richest man turns to to fix his problems handle his fortune and make sure he stays in-line … for the most part.



Jared Birchall’s background in financial services

According to Yahoo Finance Birchall has a bachelor of arts from Brigham Young University. He initially started out as a financial analyst at Goldman Sachs before moving to Merrill Lynch as a private wealth adviser. Bloomberg reported he was fired from Merrill Lynch for allegedly “sending correspondence to a client without management approval”.



He later became senior vice-president at Morgan Stanley where he became known for his handling of wealthy client’s assets. In 2016 he was hired by Musk as the managing director of Excession LLC his family office.



He’s low key

Although his boss has a reputation for outlandish comments published for all to see on social media Birchall is more subdued. Bloomberg reported that former classmates don’t specifically remember him and even in the workplace colleagues have spoken about recognising his name but that’s where it ends. What is known is that he is a devout Mormon and is a married father of five.



He’s Elon Musk’s right-hand man

Birchall has quickly become one of the key players in Musk’s inner circle. Excession LLC is the office from where most of his money is managed reported Bloomberg. He is also a board member at the Musk Foundation and responsible for handling the billionaire’s itinerary.



According to Bloomberg Birchall has the final say on everything regarding Musk from organising transport for his boss to hiring nannies for his children and ensuring his security. To insiders Birchall is considered the No 1 confidant and the one person Musk trusts implicitly.



He makes big deals

Bloomberg reported it was Birchall who was behind Musk’s initial plan to buy Twitter Inc. He put together a complex deal that involved a US$12.5 billion loan from Morgan Stanley and other sources linked to Musk’s stake in Tesla.



In 2018 Birchall was tasked with digging up dirt on cave diver Vernon Unsworth who criticised Musk’s suggestion that a SpaceX submarine suit might be used to help them save a football team trapped in a cave in Thailand. In a later defamation suit brought by Unsworth Birchall admitted to using a false name and hiring an investigator. He went on to say he often used false names in an effort to gather information for anything his boss desires.

Arnault the 72-year-old CEO of French luxury conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has built his fortune over the span of almost four decades amassing an empire that includes some of the best-known names in fashion jewellery and alcohol including Louis Vuitton Tag Heuer and Dom Pérignon.

When it comes to the world of luxury goods no one is more successful than Bernard Arnault.

Here’s how Arnault got his start and became one of the richest people in the world.

The 73-year-old French businessman is the chairman and CEO of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton known as LVMH. Arnault owns a 97.5 per cent stake in Christian Dior which controls 41.2 per cent of LVMH.

Arnault comes from the northern French town of Roubaix and studied engineering at one of France’s most prestigious schools the École Polytechnique. After graduating Arnault went to work for his father’s construction company Ferret-Savinel.

In 1984 Arnault acquired an ailing company called Agache-Willot-Boussac which owned brands like French department store Le Bon Marché and the fashion house Christian Dior. He renamed the firm Financière Agache and initiated a turnaround cutting costs and selling off some of its businesses. Soon after he bought fashion house Celine and funded the French designer Christian Lacroix.

In the late 1980s Arnault said his goal was to run the world’s largest luxury company within the following decade. He then set his sights on LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton spending US$2.6 billion buying up shares to become the company’s largest shareholder and eventually its chairman and CEO by 1989.

Arnault married Anne Dewavrin in 1973 and they had two children together before separating in 1990. Arnault remarried in 1991 to Hélène Mercier a Canadian concert pianist. He reportedly wooed her by playing Chopin and other classical composers.

Like many of his fellow billionaires Arnault lives a lavish life. He travels by private jet owns a sprawling holiday villa in glitzy Saint-Tropez on the French Riviera and reportedly has also spent at least US$96.4 million on residential properties in the Los Angeles area: in Beverly Hills the Trousdale Estates and Hollywood Hills.

The French billionaire and his wife live on Paris’s Left Bank south of the Seine River a historic area that includes neighbourhoods such as the Latin Quarter and St Germain-des-Prés.

In their home Arnault keeps a collection of modern and contemporary art from artists that include Jean-Michel Basquiat Damien Hirst Maurizio Cattelan Andy Warhol and Pablo Picasso.

Arnault has five children: two (Delphine and Antoine) with his first wife and three ( Alexandre Frédéric  and Jean) with his current wife.

Delphine Arnault’s oldest daughter is the apparent heiress to the LVMH empire. She started her career at American consultancy firm McKinsey in Paris and is now the executive vice-president at Louis Vuitton. In January 2019 Delphine became the youngest member of LVMH’s executive committee at age 43.

Delphine married Italian wine heir Alessandro Vallarino Gancia in 2005 in what Forbes called at the time “France’s wedding of the year”. They divorced in 2010. She now reportedly lives with tech billionaire Xavier Niel and has one daughter. Delphine is notoriously private about her personal life. In a 2014 interview with the Financial Times she said “I’m quite discreet. I think I’d rather focus on my work.”

Delphine’s younger brother Antoine is chief executive of menswear label Berluti and chair of the cashmere label Loro Piana both LVMH brands. In addition to those roles Antoine was named head of communications and image for LVMH in June 2018.

He’s married to supermodel Natalia Vodianova whom he reportedly met on a shoot for a 2008 Louis ­Vuitton campaign when he was the brand’s head of communications. The couple lives in Paris with their two children and Vodianova’s three children from a previous marriage.

Alexandre the son of Bernard Arnault and Mercier is an executive at Tiffany. LVMH acquired Tiffany in 2021 after which Alexandre became the company’s executive vice-president of product and communications.

Before moving over to Tiffany Alexandre was the CEO of Rimowa  a German luggage brand owned by LVMH. Alexandre is long-time friends with Evan Spiegel the chief executive of Snap. Spiegel told The New York Times that Alexandre is “a really creative guy” and that “he’s constantly thinking about the brand and how to express that”.

Alexandre’s younger brother Frédéric is the CEO of Tag Heuer . Frédéric joined LVMH as the temporary head of connected technologies at Tag Heuer in 2017. A year later he became strategy and digital director at the Swiss watch company LVMH’s largest watch brand. In 2020 Frédéric was named Tag Heuer’s CEO.

Frédéric graduated from his father’s alma mater École Polytechnique in Paris and interned at Facebook and consulting firm McKinsey before joining LVMH.

Arnault’s youngest son Jean joined the family business in 2021. He became marketing and product director in Louis Vuitton’s watch division in August 2021. Jean who was 23 at the time has a master’s degree in financial mathematics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology as well as a master’s in mechanical engineering from Imperial College London WWD reported.

According to his LinkedIn profile he interned at Morgan Stanley and McLaren Racing and worked in a Louis Vuitton retail store before joining the company full-time.

Arnault has rubbed shoulders with some of the planet’s most influential figures in the fashion world and otherwise.

In 2017 Arnault met President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower in New York City right before Trump’s inauguration to discuss expanding LVMH factories in the US. The company opened a new 100000 sq ft Louis Vuitton factory in Texas in 2019 the company’s third factory in the US.

Arnault was reportedly friends with Apple founder Steve Jobs. Jobs once said to Arnault: “You know Bernard I don’t know if in 50 years my iPhone will still be a success but I can tell you I’m sure everybody will still drink your Dom Pérignon.”

Former Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein once called Arnault “a complete visionary” adding that he “saw the increase of wealth in the world”.

Arnault is reportedly long-time friends with former French president Nicolas Sarkozy and was a witness at Sarkozy’s wedding to singer and model Carla Bruni.

Arnault considered the legendary designer and Chanel creative director Karl Lagerfeld a good friend.

“The death of this dear friend deeply saddens me my wife and my children” Arnault said in a statement upon Lagerfeld’s death in 2019. “We loved and admired him deeply. Fashion and culture has lost a great inspiration.”

But Arnault also has a long-standing public rivalry: with François Pinault the founder of luxury group Kering who’s worth about US$37 billion. Kering owns brands including Gucci and Yves St Laurent. The billionaire also owns Christie’s auction house.

LVMH originally tried to acquire a majority stake in Gucci in 1999 but Pinault ultimately snatched up the brand.

Over the years Arnault has built LVMH into the largest luxury conglomerate in the world and earned himself an imposing nickname: “the wolf in the cashmere coat”.

He’s behind the creation of Fondation Louis Vuitton a Frank Gehry-designed contemporary art museum and performance space in Paris that opened in 2014.

In April 2019 LVMH released a statement on behalf of the Arnault family pledging €200 million to help rebuild the Notre-Dame Cathedral which was heavily damaged in a 2019 fire.

In October 2020 Arnault’s company bought Tiffany for US$15.8 billion in the luxury sector’s biggest deal. The contentious sale involved multiple lawsuits and a US$400 million price drop.

When it comes to finances the past few years have been a roller-coaster ride for Arnault and LVMH.

In January 2019 Arnault made US$4.3 billion in a single day after LVMH shares surged 6.9 per cent. And just six months later on June 19 2019 Arnault again made news when he became the third person in the world to reach a US$100 billion net worth.

Then the coronavirus pandemic hit and pandemic-related shutdowns sank LVMH’s stock sending Arnault’s personal net worth down more than US$30 billion by May 2020.

But as the world opened up again LVMH’s stock recovered thanks to strong sales in fashion and leather goods and an uptick in alcohol sales particularly champagne.

It’s been a good year so far for the company: it recorded €36.7 billion in revenue in the first half of 2022 up 28 per cent from the same period in 2021.

Arnault remains the world’s third-richest person behind Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos with a fortune worth US$137 billion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA4LTA3L3BqdC1wYXJ0bmVycy1zcG9ydHMtYmFua2VyLWRvbi1jb3Jud2VsbC13aWxsLWpvaW4taXRzLWJvYXJk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PJT Partners Sports Banker K.

Gair Maxwell author of Big Little Legends joined Moose Jaw Mayor Clive Tolley at the building formerly known as Mosaic Place where guests listened to local business leaders and enjoyed pulled pork sandwiches and a Moose Jaw-brewed IPA.

The city is currently hunting a new naming partner for the Moose Jaw Events Centre after the Mosaic Company declined to renew their partnership.

The event took place August 4 in the Founder’s Lounge. Craig Hemingway the City’s communications manager thanked sponsors including Burns & McDonnell Thunder Creek Pork which supplied the meal and the staff at the Events Centre.

The night’s featured businesses were the Moose Jaw Brewing Company (MJBC) Lion’s Creek Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar and the Moose Jaw Co-op.

Tolley noted as the event got underway that he had only met Maxwell that evening but discovered they shared a past in hockey colour commentary. The pair spent some time bantering in character before Maxwell talked about how the city’s prohibition-era reputation lent itself well to the brand of Most Notorious City in Canada.

Maxwell’s style during the evening was to interrogate guests on their branding strategies and try to come up with suggestions for their next reputation-building move. He engaged the audience with rhetorical questions such as:

“I just want to know if fundamentally you’re ok with greatly expanding your customer base and driving revenue is that ok are we ok with that?”

Terry Zwarich and Cody Schulze are the passionate brewers and co-owners behind the Moose Jaw Brewing Company (MJBC) which began producing beverage in January 2022. They brought a sample of their MJBC IPA which was the evening’s hot topic.

The MJBC’s “silly sauce” — Zwarich’s description — is currently available from Cask 82 Bugsy’s Irish Pub The Crushed Can Rec Room & Bar and the Sobey’s Liquor Store. The company’s passion for their process was apparent as Zwarich and Schulze described the various influences of time temperature humidity herbs and spices on their flavours and how they have refined a consistent taste in their core lineup.

Charmaine Franken of Lion’s Creek was up after the MJBC.

Lion’s Creek’s flagship store in Moose Jaw but the company imports its olives from South Africa and its balsamic vinegar from Modena Italy. Franken told the story of their successful rebranding.

The name Lion’s Creek comes from the source of their olives in South Africa — where two rivers converge. Both rivers are named after the legendary predator: Leeu in Afrikaans and Gamka in Khoisan.

Free tasting sessions staff expertise a wide variety of pairing options and scores of flavours have made Lion’s Creek justifiably famous and a regular stop for downtown shoppers.

Geoff Anderson was the final guest. Anderson has been the general manager of the Moose Jaw Co-op Association since 2019 and has built a reputation for his community participation. He is the current chair of the Downtown Moose Jaw Association (DMJA) which recently announced a goal of creating Canada’s Most Notoriously Charming downtown.

Anderson is also on the board of the Moose Jaw Transition House and joined forces with 15 other men last November for a Transition House fundraiser.

Anderson and his wife Juanita mentioned that their careers with the Co-op have resulted in more than 45 moves between the two of them. During his conversation with Tolley and Maxwell Anderson expressed his passion for the culture of customer-owned co-operatives which translates into a brand centered around experience rather than product.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5ld3NoZXJhbGQuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMDcvbXVyYWxzLW9uLXdlc3QtamVmZmVyc29uLWluLXRyZW50b24tc3RvcHBpbmctdHJhZmZpYy1oaWdobGlnaHRzLWNpdHlzLXJldml0YWxpemF0aW9uL9IBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVuZXdzaGVyYWxkLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzA3L211cmFscy1vbi13ZXN0LWplZmZlcnNvbi1pbi10cmVudG9uLXN0b3BwaW5nLXRyYWZmaWMtaGlnaGxpZ2h0cy1jaXR5cy1yZXZpdGFsaXphdGlvbi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Murals on West Jefferson in Trenton stopping traffic; highlight city’s revitalization,"What better way is there to say “Welcome to Trenton” than with large-scale murals highlighting the very things that separate it from other communities?

Those traveling the area of West Jefferson and King are getting the visual effects of the unique greeting from the east and west sides of the streets just under the train bridge.

The murals which are still in the works depict kayakers enjoying a day on the water lush trees in the background wildlife biking along trails docks and larger boats in the water on the west side

The east side shows Trenton in big bold block letters and pays tribute to the city’s 2021 designation as a Pure Michigan Trail Town.

It promotes Trenton as a place to also hike shop and dine while identifying it as being among the “best of the best” in the state promoting healthy lifestyles conserving natural resources and providing a catalyst for economic activity in the community.

Trenton Mayor Pro Tem Wendy Pate said the area was in desperate need of a lift and believed something professional was needed to bring out the assets the city has to offer.

Pate said the surroundings in that particular area were particularly sad and made people not want to bring friends and family along that route to Trenton.

TreeTown Murals went to the drawing board and came up with outlines that fit the bill to represent the city’s activities.

“We wanted something fantastic there” she said.

Pate said the Downtown Development Authority was approached with the master plans and agreed to fund murals along with the city.

The murals represent Trenton as being a gateway to the only International Wildlife Refuge in North America and connection to the Downriver Linked Greenways part of the statewide Iron Belle Trail.

Volunteers have signed up to paint in shifts a couple of times a week with the guidance of TreeTown Murals a Michigan mural and mosaic company specializing in custom design and community participation.

Volunteers have been following the company’s design outlines for weeks garnering a good deal of attention from motorists.

That in particular has been gratifying to Pate who has enjoyed watching cars drive by and seeing the reactions.

“People will drive by and honk their horns” Pate said as volunteers continue to paint. “You’ve got to go down and see it. It just warms my heart.”

Motorists are literally stopping and asking if they can have a mural painted on their garage or their walls.

Pate said she believes the massive murals are bringing the area to life and helping people understand the impact of art and color while providing a good visual image of Trenton as well.

The murals are about 80% complete.

Pate anticipates they will finish all of the painting on both murals by early September and she couldn’t be more excited.

She hopes it inspires more murals in other places that shows off Trenton’s waterfront revitalization and economic development.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcm9jY293b3JsZG5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMzUwNjUzL2VtYWlscy1jb25maXJtLW1vc2FpYy1zLWxvYmJ5aW5nLWFnYWluc3QtbW9yb2NjYW4tZmVydGlsaXplcnMtaW4tdXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Emails Confirm Mosaic's Lobbying Against Moroccan Fertilizers in US,Click allow to get notifications on every article we post.,,,,,,

Recognized by GOBankingRates as one of Money’s Most Influential — and tied for the No. 1 spot among the most popular and well-known money experts — here he shares why “do nothing” is often the best investment strategy and the one factor that can determine whether or not a company is a good investment.

What’s the one piece of money advice you wish every person would follow?

Don’t follow excitement follow your homework. People tend to chase excitement in markets thinking if everyone else is buying or selling they should be too. Instead we all need to do our homework and have a good reason why we are buying or selling a stock.

And when you don’t know what to do do nothing. Over the long haul of decades the markets will work in your favor.

What’s the worst investment you’ve ever made?

So many I can’t name one. Typically it’s a private company where I trusted someone I should not have. Integrity of the CEO often is a greater determinant of an investment’s future performance than their business acumen.

If you are investing money you can’t afford to lose in a private company make sure you get independent references on management.

Some of Colorado’s key technology sectors will reap benefits from the $280 billion CHIPS and Science Act recently passed by Congress and expected to be signed into law by President Joe Biden on Tuesday.

But how big that impact will be remains unknown and will vary by industry and — in some cases — will depend on future congressional appropriations.

The U.S. Senate passed the measure by a 64-33 vote July 27 with the U.S. House of Representatives following suit the next day 243-187.

A local experienced solar installer will help you navigate the complexities of commercial solar to achieve financial success for your project.

Much of the attention surrounding the CHIPS Act — formally called the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science Act — focuses on the semiconductor sector with $52 billion going toward semiconductor research and development and a 25% advanced manufacturing investment tax credit for expansion of manufacturing capacity for semiconductors or semiconductor manufacturing equipment.

But the Act also includes hundreds of billions of dollars in spending authorizations — Congress still must appropropriate the funds in the future — to support other science-based industries including:

A five-year authorization of $81 billion for the National Science Foundation including $20 billion for the NSF’s Directorate for Technology Innovation and Partnerships.

A five-year authorization of about $10 billion for the National Institute of Standards and Technology potentially doubling the budget of the federal laboratory. Boulder hosts one of two NIST campuses nationwide.

$15 billion to upgrade infrastructure at Department of Energy federal laboratories such as the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden.

Authorizes $100 million per year to support quantum-network infrastructure and requires establishment of a Quantum User Expansion for Science and Technology program or QUEST to encourage access to quantum-computing hardware and clouds for research purposes

Other provisions would increase spending for research in fusion energy biology the environment and other scientific disciplines.

Semiconductors dominate bill

National-security concerns and critical supply-chain shortages propelled funding to boost the semiconductor sector with actual appropriations rather than just spending authorizations.

“Semiconductors are the 21st century’s Space Race we must win” Colorado Sen. John Hickenlooper said in a prepared statement after Senate passage. “Relying on foreign-made semiconductors makes us vulnerable to higher prices and potentially being cut off. This bill will reinvigorate American manufacturing lower costs and create more good-paying jobs.”

Hickenlooper presided over the Senate vote to pass the bill and helped write the bill as part of the Senate Committee on Commerce Science and Transportation. He also served on the Conference Committee to reconcile differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill.

Congressional passage occurred after years of debate hand-wringing and concerns over the loss of U.S. competitiveness in semiconductor manufacturing especially compared with increased Chinese investment in the sector.

Semiconductors are used in every electronic device from cars to cell phones military hardware to medical devices computers to clean-tech equipment.

The Semiconductor Industry Association estimates that the U.S. share of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity has dropped from 37% in 1990 to 12% today. Much of that capacity resides in East Asia including China and Taiwan.

“The U.S. in terms of semiconductor production has fallen behind and that is mainly due to the fact of not [having] a coordinated effort to attract semiconductor manufacturing from a strategic federal level and has kind of left it up to the states — for Texas or Arizona or Colorado or California to compete with countries like Taiwan China Japan South Korea” said Jim Feldhan founder and president of Semico Research Corp. a Phoenix-based semiconductor marketing and consulting research company. “And it hasn’t been a very effective strategy.”

Feldhan noted that the bill — though “not a drop in the bucket” — remains far below what China is investing in the semiconductor industry estimated at $150 billion.

But the CHIPS Act does represent a significant change in U.S. policy he said.

“It’s a dramatic change to the U.S. government to pass a bill where they really are trying to support the industry because for so many years it was just not on the priority list” he said with semiconductor manufacturing substantially more affordable in Asia.

Department of Defense officials long have argued for increasing U.S. semiconductor-manufacturing capabilities for national-security reasons. Semiconductors are used in all major U.S. defense systems and foreign production raises concerns not only about supply chains but also about potential “backdoors” that can be inserted into chips allowing them to be reprogrammed or shut off.

Additionally the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting supply-chain disruptions have prompted government and private-sector companies to rethink the “just-in-time” global supply-chain model whereby goods arrive from suppliers only when needed.

“The pandemic has really solidified the idea that semiconductors are actually a strategic commodity and are needed for our own security and health of our overall economy” Feldhan said adding that companies have found that keeping an inventory. “may not be a bad idea.”

Add in “saber-rattling” between the U.S. and China over Taiwan and U.S. support for the semiconductor industry makes strategic sense he said.

“If something happened to Taiwan it would be a disaster not only for our economy but the whole world in terms of the semiconductor industry” he said.

And the semiconductor industry sees an opportunity in the CHIPS Act. Online technology publication Protocol recently estimated that chip-makers spent $100 million on lobbying for the bill and other measures over several years.

What about Colorado?

The Semiconductor Industry Association ranks Colorado No. 16 in the country in terms of semiconductor manufacturing jobs at 2900 and No. 17 in terms of semiconductor establishments at 29. Colorado exports about $840 million in semiconductors annually according to the SIA.

Colorado’s semiconductor industry includes companies engaged in chip design as well as two manufacturing centers:

Broadcom Inc. (Nasdaq: AVGO) operates a wafer-manufacturing facility in Fort Collins. The company told BizWest in 2019 that it employed 1747 locally including 1313 employees and 434 contingent workers.

Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) based in Chandler Arizona employs about 700 at a semiconductor manufacturing plant in Colorado Springs and in January announced a $40 million retooling project at the plant.

It’s unknown whether Broadcom will seek to expand its fab facility in Fort Collins to take advantage of the CHIPS Act. Broadcom officials did not return requests for comment.

Northern Colorado and the Boulder area also host many research and design centers for semiconductors and other storage devices including:

Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC) employs 350 workers at its Fort Collins Design Center 4701 Technology Parkway.

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (Nasdaq: AMD) operates at 2950 E. Harmony Road in Fort Collins across Ziegler Road from Broadcom and kitty-corner from Intel.

Micron Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MU) employs an estimated 250 at a Longmont facility developing advanced-memory and semiconductor technologies.

Qualcomm Inc. (Nasdaq: QCOM) maintains a hub in Boulder’s Gunbarrel area.

Rivos Inc. a Mountain View California-based stealth-mode startup has leased about 4500 square feet at 2950 E. Harmony Road in Fort Collins — in the same building that houses AMD.

Michelle Hadwiger director of global business development for the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade said the bulk of the CHIPS funds likely will go toward other states for expansion of fab facilities.

“What I think the CHIPS Act will do is primarily benefit the large fab facilities in areas like Ohio where Intel is making significant investments” she said “and for Colorado it will be more research-and-development-oriented and buildout of smaller fabrication facilities.

“I do think that Colorado does have some pockets of investment opportunities but I think the largest sum of money of the $52 billion package will go to the larger fab facilities” she added.

Colorado does enjoy a robust sector for semiconductor R&D she noted with ties to legacy industries such as telecommunications medical devices battery technology information technology and other sectors.

“I think Colorado’s competitive advantage is really in those legacy companies that know what they’re doing have a lot of market share but aren’t going to be doing the large fab but are going to be niche innovation and technology driven at the level of precision that goes into multiple industry sectors versus just being a mass-production type of play” she said.

Boosting quantum research

One key technology that receives a significant boost in the CHIPS and Science Act is quantum computing which uses quantum mechanics to solve problems far faster than classical computers.

Colorado — especially Boulder and Broomfield counties — has become a hub for the sector with Honeywell International Inc. (Nasdaq: HON) spinoff Quantinuum LLC in Broomfield ColdQuanta Inc. in Boulder and a robust quantum program at the University of Colorado Boulder among other quantum operations.

Tony Uttley president and chief operating officer for Quantinuum said the CHIPS Act represents a big step forward for the quantum industry.

“At a high level what has been included is an understanding that this technology is going to be as transformative as it is and a realization that there needs to be funding that is supporting the rapid development of this technology” he said.

Uttley said inclusion of quantum computing in the CHIPS Act makes sense given that quantum computing requires both classical computations — and therefore semiconductor chips — and quantum computations at the same time.

Quantum computing was included in the CHIPS Act as one of the key technology focus areas for the NSF’s Directorate for Technology Innovation and Partnerships helping spur commercialization of the technology from laboratories to the marketplace.

But Uttley said he is most excited about the QUEST program — for which he personally advocated — and which essentially sets the federal government up as a customer of the quantum industry.

“The U.S. government is in almost every sector one of the biggest customers. It hasn’t been in quantum computing” Uttley said.

Up until now he said the government has unintentionally competed with private quantum companies.

“When it comes to quantum computing particularly at this stage in its evolution it all comes down to nouns: people places things” he said. “If you’re going to put in a place fine but if you start going after people and things which means all the materials you now have become directly competitive with all of these other companies that have spent all of this time trying to build up these incredible teams and build up these incredible systems.

“It was inadvertent” he added. “It was not an intentional ‘trying to be disruptive to the ecosystem’ but it was.”

The CHIPS Act — and specifically the QUEST program — set a different course with the U.S. government working with private quantum companies including buying time on quantum computers.

“So you’ve had all of these companies like Quantinuum who have really done all of the hard work and research in building these quantum computers and there’s a missing piece of being able to have all of these various parts of the government get access to those quantum computers that already exist and understand how they work and how to advantage of them and how to plan for their eventual inclusion into the systems and processes that exist today” Uttley said. ”There was just a flat-out gap and this really goes a long way to trying to close that gap.”

Small manufacturers left out

But not everyone is enamored with the CHIPS Act. Edmond Johnson president and owner of Premier Manufacturing Inc. in Frederick said the bill includes no provisions that will benefit his sector contract manufacturing of printed circuit boards.

“Nothing to my knowledge is coming here [to Colorado] out of that bill” Johnson said “In addition what’s in it for small manufacturing? I don’t see anything that’s really in it.”

He noted that semiconductor companies for years shifted manufacturing jobs overseas rather than investing in the U.S.

“I’m an onshore guy” he said.

Johnson said he’s much more enthusiastic about clean-tech provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act now moving through the Senate for approval.

Premier which has about 70 employees has an arrangement pending to manufacture electric-vehicle batteries for a company in Michigan and also has its own proprietary software product for solar energy.

“That has broader appeal to us” Johnson said speaking of the clean-tech provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act. “It will give a chance to migrate into something from a manufacturing standpoint across the board that is new technology. I think there is going to be a genuine emphasis on keeping that here. Whatever we create keep it here.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA4LzA2L3ByZWRpY3Rpb24tdGhlc2Utd2lsbC1iZS0xMC1sYXJnZXN0LXN0b2Nrcy1ieS0yMDMwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Prediction: These Will Be the 10 Largest Stocks by 2030,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.fool.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /investing/2022/08/06/prediction-these-will-be-10-largest-stocks-by-2030/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D81BC0A30>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA4LzA2L3ByZWRpY3Rpb24tdGhlc2Utd2lsbC1iZS0xMC1sYXJnZXN0LXN0b2Nrcy1ieS0yMDMwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

It's becoming a media company,"New York CNN Business —

Netflix has had a terrible 2022. In April it said it lost subscribers for the first time since 2011. Its stock has tumbled more than 60% so far this year.

Yet its recent struggles may not be the start of a downward spiral or the beginning of the end for the streaming giant. Rather it’s a sign that Netflix is becoming a more traditional media company.

Netflix (NFLX) was originally valued as a Big Tech company part of the Wall Street acronym “FAANG” which stood for Facebook (FB) Apple (AAPL) Amazon (AMZN) Netflix (NFLX) and Google (GOOG). Wall Street once valued the company at about $300 billion — a number on par with many Big Tech companies that Netflix (NFLX)’s business model ultimately couldn’t live up to.

“I think Netflix was extremely overvalued” Julia Alexander director of strategy at Parrot Analytics told CNN Business. “Unlike those companies that have different tentacles Netflix does not have a lot of tentacles.”

But Netflix was never really a tech company.

Yes it relied on subscriber growth like many companies in the tech world but its subscriber growth was built on having films and TV shows that people wanted to watch and pay for. That’s more a like a studio in Hollywood than a tech company in Silicon Valley.

Netflix looked a lot more like a tech company than say Disney Comcast Paramount or CNN parent company Warner Bros. Discovery. But as those traditional media companies start to look a lot more like Netflix Netflix in turn is starting to take page out of its rivals’ playbooks: It’s going to start serving ads and it has been releasing some shows over the course of weeks and months rather than all at once.

Netflix has said that its cheaper ad tier and clampdown on password sharing may come next year. It’s partnering with Microsoft (MSFT) for its ad business.

“I think in many ways the moves Netflix are making suggest a transition from tech company to media company” Andrew Hare a senior vice president of research at Magid told CNN Business. “With the introduction of ads crackdown on password sharing marquee shows like ‘Stranger Things’ experimenting with a staggered release we are seeing Netflix looking more like a traditional media company every day.”

Hare added that Netflix’s former business strategy which was “once sacrosanct is now being thrown out the window.”

“Netflix once forced Hollywood deeply out of its comfort zone. They brought streaming to the American living room” he said. “Now it appears some more conventional practices could be what Netflix needs.”

At Netflix right now “a lot of these strategic moves are being made as they mature and move into the next phase as a company” noted Hare. That includes focusing on cash flow and revenue rather than just growth.

“In other words old school business” he said.

Since last November the company has been rolling out the games as a way to keep users engaged between show releases. The games are accessible only to subscribers but have to be downloaded as separate apps.

The games have been downloaded a total of 23.3 million times and average 1.7 million daily users according to Apptopia an app analytics company. That's less than 1% of Netflix's 221 million subscribers.

The importance of games to Netflix's overall strategy has arguably increased in recent months as the company faces intensifying competition for user attention. In the second quarter Netflix lost nearly a million subscribers after losing 200000 subscribers during the first quarter — its first subscriber declines in more than a decade.

In a letter to shareholders last year Netflix named Epic Games and TikTok as among its biggest rivals for people's time.

""One of the many advantages to Netflix in pursuing the strategy is the ability to drive engagement beyond when the show first comes out on the platform"" D.A Davidson senior analyst Tom Forte said.

Still Netflix Chief Operating Officer Greg Peters said last year the company was ""many months and really frankly years"" into learning how games can keep customers on the service.

""We're going to be experimental and try a bunch of things"" Peters said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings conference call. ""But I would say the eyes that we have on the long-term prize really center more around our ability to create properties that are connected to the universes the characters the stories that we're building.""

The company's current catalog of 24 game apps covers a variety of genres and Netflix shows such as ""Stranger Things: 1984."" Several are modeled after popular card games such as ""Mahjong Solitaire"" and ""Exploding Kittens.""

The catalog will grow to 50 games by the end of the year including ""Queen's Gambit Chess"" based on the hit Netflix series according a company representative.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL3RoZS1hc2NlbnQvcGVyc29uYWwtZmluYW5jZS9hcnRpY2xlcy9kb25lLXdpdGgtbmV0ZmxpeC10cnktdGhlc2UtNy1jaGVhcGVyLWFsdGVybmF0aXZlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Done With Netflix?

Ever since they sent DVDs to our mailboxes Netflix has been a big part of our home entertainment. But while Netflix may have been our first streaming platform its ever-increasing prices have driven many folks to the competition. And there is certainly a lot of competition. Most major networks and production houses now have their own platforms -- and many of them are cheaper than Netflix. Before we dive into the alternatives let's take a look at what a Netflix subscription costs:

Netflix Basic Standard Premium Cost (Monthly) $9.99 $15.49 $19.99 Simultaneous Streams 1 2 4 Video Quality SD HD HD (Select 4K) Offline Viewing Yes (1 Device) Yes (2 Devices) Yes (4 Devices)

As of now the cheapest Netflix plan is their $9.99 a month basic plan. While somewhat affordable the quality of what you get is poor. You're stuck with standard definition -- which looks terrible on modern screens -- and you can only stream on one device at a time. While Netflix is close to releasing a cheaper ad-supported option it has yet to be released. We also don't know how much it's going to cost or what you'll get with it. Will you have HD or be stuck with SD like the Basic plan? Even with an ad-supported plan many folks are simply ready for some fresh content from a new streamer. Either way let's take a look at some of our other options: 1. Hulu Hulu is the go-to alternative for many previous (and some current) Netflix users. It offers a huge selection of TV and movies as well as award-winning original content. Its ad-supported option is cheaper than even Netflix's Basic plan. If you don't want ads opt for the No Ads subscription which gives you multiple streams and HD content for less than Netflix's comparable option.

Hulu Ads No Ads Cost (Monthly) $6.99 $12.99 Cost (Annual) $69.99 N/A Simultaneous Streams 2 2 Video Quality HD (Select 4K) HD (Select 4K) Offline Viewing No Yes

2. Disney+ Disney+ is home to many of the most popular entertainment brands in the world including Star Wars and Marvel. It's also a great place to find a variety of Fox shows as well as Disney content going back decades. The monthly cost of a Disney+ subscription is less than even basic Netflix and you can cut it down even further with an annual plan. That said Disney+ doesn't have the vast dynamic content library of a Netflix or Hulu so it may not be a great option for a single-service home. If you want more content bundle Disney+ with Hulu and ESPN+. You'll pay $13.99 a month for Disney+ / ESPN+ / Hulu (Ads) and $19.99 a month for Disney+ / ESPN+ / Hulu (No Ads).

Disney+ Disney+ Monthly Disney+ Annual Cost $7.99 $79.99 Ads No No Simultaneous Streams 4 4 Video Quality HD (Select 4K) HD (Select 4K) Offline Viewing Yes Yes

3. Peacock Fans of NBC Universal television shows and movies can find a lot to watch on their Peacock streaming service. It's also one of the only major services with a free option which includes a few live TV channels and a good deal of content. The Premium option gives you ad-supported access to all of the platform content. Add a few extra bucks to kick the ads. If you opt for the annual Premium+ plan you'll get ad-free HD-quality streams on up to three screens for less than the price of a basic Netflix subscription.

Peacock Free Premium Premium+ Cost (Monthly) $0 $6.99 $12.99 Cost (Annual) $0 $49.99 $99.99 Ads Yes Yes No Simultaneous Streams 3 3 3 Video Quality HD (Select 4K) HD (Select 4k) HD (Select 4k) Offline Viewing No No Yes

4. HBO Max Once a channel mostly for movies and comedy specials HBO's current streaming platform is now far more. You can find not only movies and original programming but also a wide range of popular television shows. While the With Ads plan is the same price as Basic Netflix you get HD quality and three streams. The Ad-Free version is cheaper than the comparable mid-tier Netflix plan. And if you pay annually you can save quite a bit on either plan.

HBO Max With Ads Ad-Free Cost (Monthly) $9.99 $14.99 Cost (Annual) $99.99 $149.99 Simultaneous Streams 3 3 Video Quality HD (Select 4K) HD (Select 4K) Offline Viewing No Yes

5. Paramount+ Another network-turned-streamer Paramount+ is a solid option for CBS fans. You'll find the whole range of Star Trek movies and shows including all of the newest creations. There's also Paramount's catalog of movies and decades of TV shows. The ad-supported Essential plan is half the price of a Basic Netflix subscription and you can get ads (plus HD and multiple streams) for the full cost. Or go annual and get Premium at a discount.

Paramount+ Essential Premium Cost (Monthly) $4.99 $9.99 Cost (Annual) $49.99 $99.99 Ads Yes No Simultaneous Streams 3 3 Video Quality HD (Select 4K) HD (Select 4K) Offline Viewing No Yes

6. Amazon Prime Video If you're an Amazon Prime subscriber you may already have access to a decent Netflix alternative as Amazon Prime Video is included in your Prime Membership. Without a regular Prime subscription you can still get access to a ton of content with a standalone Prime Video subscription. The Video-only sub comes in less than a Basic Netflix plan.

Amazon Prime Video Prime Video Prime (Monthly) Prime (Annual) Costs $8.99 $14.99 $139 Ads No No No Simultaneous Streams 3 3 3 Video Quality HD (Select 4K) HD (Select 4K) HD (Select 4K) Offline Viewing Yes Yes Yes

7. Your local library Depending on how much content you go through -- and whether you need the latest big show -- your local library could be your most affordable Netflix alternative. With your handy dandy library card free from your local branch you can access the Hoopla and/or Kanopy apps (access may vary by region). This unlocks access to stream TV shows movies and even music. Cycle services for ultimate savings If you're struggling to make a single service work don't waste money on more content than you can watch. Instead cycle services. Get a month of one watch what you want then move on the next month. This ensures you always have access to the latest binge-worthy content without the high cost of multiple services.

“Why does everything looked so stretched upwards? Is it supposed to be dreamy and I’m just an uncultured swine or is there something wrong” one user asked.

“Sandman” viewers first noticed the skewed images in trailers for the series sparking some trepidation among fans of the original comic book series. The distorted images were not isolated to the trailer remaining a mainstay in the series itself.

Some questioned whether a technical issue was the causing the distinctive visuals. But the image distortion is a deliberate creative choice on “The Sandman.”

Many of the environments are surreal in the series and the idea is to give the feeling of what a dream would feel like.

The series is based on the DC Comics character of the same name. Tom Sturridge stars as Dream — aka Morpheus. He lurks in a realm called the Dreaming and when he’s captured his absence triggers events that change both the sleeping and waking worlds.

Popular on Variety

Throughout “The Sandman” distorted images show the cast with elongated faces and stretched visuals giving the series a surreal feeling.

Will Baldy Sam Heasman and George Steel serve as the show’s cinematographers. The group has yet to comment on the type of lenses they used to film the production. If for example vintage lenses were used and mixed with an 8K camera the combination of old glass and a new camera could work to create image distortion. Alternatively using old-school wide-angle lens with the distortion on the sides would create stretched visuals.

So there’s no need to fix your TV and adjust your aspect ratio. “The Sandman” looks exactly how its creators want it to.

According to them the deplorable and inaccessible nature of the roads was a major setback to the socio-economic life of the people in the area.

This came to light when the Communication Team of the Nzema Koyele Eku toured some communities in the Nzema area.

The tour allowed the team to get acquainted with developmental challenges bedevilling the Nzema area and come out with measures to address them.

Speaking to the Ghana News Agency an opinion leader of Ebonloa Mr Richard Cobbinah said the seven-kilometre road from Bawia to Ebonloa had been awarded on contract but nothing had been done on it.

The Project formed part of the 44.0 km Bitumen Surfacing of Roads in the Jomoro municipality.

He described the situation as wearisome as motorists found it difficult to ply that stretch thereby hampering the social and economic life of the people.

He said the situation was especially “terrible during the rains” as travellers could not use the road.

Mr Cobbinah appealed to the Jomoro Municipal Assembly and the Feeder Roads Department in the Western region to ensure the contractor returned to the site.

That road project is being supervised by the Department of Feeder Roads under the Ministry of Roads and Highways with funding from the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation.

Efforts by the GNA to get the Engineer at the Western Regional office of the Ghana Highway Authority to react to the story could not materialise as the Engineer was not available at the time of filing the report.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Michael Langley becomes the Marine Corps' first Black four-star general,"U.S. Marine Corps Gen. Michael E. Langley was promoted to the rank of general on Aug. 6 2022 in a ceremony at Marine Corps Barracks Washington.

Commandant of the Marine Corps Gen. David Berger promoted Langley who became the first Black Marine to be promoted to general.

""43 years we go from our first African American general to now our first - I think leading to many more - four-star African American generals"" said Berger paying homage to Lt. Gen. Frank E. Peterson.

Langley was joined by friends and family at the ceremony including his father Willie C. Langley who is a proud Air Force veteran. Gen. Langley repeatedly talked about his father as his greatest mentor.

""My daddy told me to aim high so I aimed as high as I could and found the few and the proud” said Gen. Langley a comment which was met with laughter amongst the crowd most of whom were Marines.

Langley was born in Shreveport Louisiana and grew up on a variety of military bases as a child before settling in Texas. He graduated from the University of Texas at Arlington and commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in 1985. Langley has served in the Marine Corps for 37 years and saw his promotion as a sign to others that Marine Corps service rewards those who work hard to achieve their goals.

""The milestone and what it means to the Corps is quite essential. Not because the mark in history but what it will affect going forward especially for those younger across society that want to aspire and look at the Marine Corps as an opportunity"" said Gen. Langley.

At an Aug. 5 briefing at the Johnson Space Center about the upcoming uncrewed Artemis 1 mission Reid Weisman the chief of the astronaut office said he expected the four-person crew who will fly on Artemis 2 to be selected soon.

“The question everyone will ask is when are we assigning a crew to Artemis 2? We hope that will be later this year” he said. That mission is expected to launch no earlier than 2024.

Artemis 2 will be the first crewed flight of Orion going around the moon on a flight lasting about 10 days. The four-person crew will include one Canadian astronaut as part of a December 2020 agreement between NASA and the Canadian Space Agency regarding Canada’s contribution of the Canadarm3 robotic arm for the lunar Gateway.

NASA has not stated if any other international partners such as Europe or Japan will fly astronauts on Artemis 2. As for the agency’s own astronauts Wiseman said the entire 42-person astronaut corps will be considered for that mission and later Artemis flights.

“The way I look at it any one of our 42 active astronauts is eligible for an Artemis mission” he said a point he emphasized several times during the briefing. “We want to assemble the right team for this mission.”

That is a change from late 2020 when NASA unveiled an “Artemis Team” of 18 astronauts that agency leadership at the time along with then-Vice President Mike Pence said would form a pool from which NASA would select crews for at least initial Artemis missions.

“My fellow Americans I give you the heroes of the future who will carry us back to the moon and beyond the Artemis generation” Pence said at a December 2020 National Space Council meeting where he announced the 18 astronauts who would comprise the team. Five of the 18 attended that meeting at the Kennedy Space Center.

Jim Bridenstine NASA administrator at the time said more astronauts would be added in the future including those from international partners. “This is our first cadre of our Artemis astronauts” Bridenstine said. “I want to be clear: there’s going to be more.”

Wiseman though emphasized that he would consider all current astronauts as well as 10 astronaut candidates currently in training. “We have 42 active astronauts here in Houston and 10 astronaut candidates who will be beating down the door for Artemis 2 and beyond” he said.

He added that NASA has also changed lifetime radiation exposure requirements which previously varied by age and gender to a single limit. A June 2021 report by the National Academies endorsed such a proposal noting it “creates equality of opportunity for spaceflight” over the previous standards that set lower limits for women.

Wiseman said those earlier “draconian” standards had been replaced by a single limit. “We have equalized all radiation limits. It does not matter whether you’re a man whether you’re a woman it is the exact same.”

“Our end goal is the United States of America is half men half women. Well space should be at least that” he said. “If we cannot make these spacecraft equitable and we can’t fly any type of person on them then we need to look at our systems and reevaluate.”

There are also no age restrictions on Artemis mission assignments he said noting the astronaut corps includes people with ages ranging from the late 20s to the mid-60s. “As long as you are healthy we’re going to load you on a rocket and shoot you off the planet.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9jYWxnYXJ5L2FkYXB0aXZlLWJpa2VzLWJvd2hlYWQtY29ycC0xLjY1NDIwNjfSASBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYmMuY2EvYW1wLzEuNjU0MjA2Nw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An accident left this man unable to bike the mountain trails he loves. So he innovated,"More than two decades ago Christian Bagg ended up in a wheelchair after a snowboarding crash. It left him paralyzed from the waist down. An avid outdoorsman the Calgarian tried everything he could to get back to the great outdoors. Eventually he found a way.

When Christian Bagg broke his back and became paralyzed from the waist down 26 years ago he was worried he wouldn't be able to continue doing the things he loved like snowboarding climbing and biking.

But with a background in machining he figured why not invent a solution? As an apprentice with the University of Calgary's engineering department he was able to set his ideas in motion.

More than two decades later Bagg is back to gravel racing cyclocross racing and riding mountain trails — all while using an adaptive bike he created.

""Necessity is the mother of invention"" Bagg said.

""We want the world of biking to be as vast for the adaptive crowd as it is for the able-bodied crowd.""

Bagg is the founder of Bowhead Corp. an adaptive off-road biking company based in Calgary that aims to give people with disabilities better access to the outdoors.

The company has sold bikes to people across the world Bagg says from Chile to Norway to Australia. The bikes were also just featured on a recent episode of the Amazing Race Canada.

Other adaptive bikes do exist but he found them either bulky or unable to manoeuvre over the uneven trails he wanted to explore. Wheelchairs didn't work either as they'd tip over on unstable ground.

""The mechanism of the bike allows one wheel to be higher and one wheel to be lower"" he said.

""We're going through nature over obstacles side slopes leaning into corners and really creating a three-wheel version of a two-wheel bike — and it really just fits seamlessly with the way a cyclist would ride.""

Originally Bagg just wanted to be able to hike with his friends and family again. But then he met a young girl with cerebral palsy and saw her reaction to his invention.

""At that moment that's when it was like OK this has to be for everybody.""

Baggs says they've created two bikes so far and a third will be released this fall. They'd also like to produce adaptive wheelchairs. (David Mercer/CBC)

The company moved from the basement to an office space just two years ago. Its team has expanded to include engineers content creators and athletes who've experienced injuries.

People are using the bikes to jump at bike parks walk their dogs or compete alongside able-bodied athletes Bagg says.

""Often with adaptive equipment you're limited by the equipment. But in this scenario you're really only limited by yourself as to what you can do.""

Bowhead bikes

Bowhead Corp. has come out with two bike models so far with a third on the way.

One is an all-electric bike which some quadriplegic bikers can use due to adapted handlebars. The other is operated by a hand crank but it does have a motor for assistance.

The Bowhead Corp. team assembles the bikes in Calgary. (David Mercer/CBC)

""We're very unique in the world as far as our technology goes"" Bagg said.

""The suspension is independent from the leaning. The leaning is independent from the steering. So this level of control is unique.""

Max Flowerday is an engineer-in-training with the team's research and development department. To him the bikes are great at simulating a more traditional mountain biking experience.

""What the articulating front does is it allows the rider to actually lean into the corner and ride in the same way that a non-adaptive bike would ride. So that's super important"" he said.

""It's not like you're riding a shopping cart. You're riding something that really provides this immersive experience.""

Max Flowerday says he always wanted to apply his engineering education to the sporting goods industry. When he found Bowhead it was a perfect fit he says. (David Mercer/CBC)

It's important for the designers to think through all the details closely. Flowerday says he came up with an idea to ensure the bike chain wouldn't derail since some of the company's customers would find it difficult to troubleshoot that problem on the fly.

""Something we're trying to focus on is making these bikes as reliable as possible.""

The designs are also evolving and when a bike is improved the new parts are compatible with older models. Bagg says he wanted customers to be able to swap out components to personalize their ride.

""I know what our customers can do now. I want to see what they can do in five years if we all put our brain power together at Bowhead and give them something amazing"" he said.

'It's just freedom'

Gustavo Ortiz a mountain bike racer from Chile is back competing after discovering the company.

He was injured while visiting Whistler five years ago and says it was difficult to get excited about sports again. When he got onto one of Bowhead's bikes his passion was rekindled he said.

""It's just freedom for me. It's like I can get anywhere I want with no help"" he said. ""I'm really stoked about it.""

He has already attended some competitions in Canada this summer and plans to continue working around the circuit.

Gustavo Ortiz says he's been racing all over the world since he was 12 years old and has always loved bikes. (David Mercer/CBC)

It's stories like this that keep pushing the Bowhead team forward. Bagg says they're continuing to evolve and want to expand to adaptive wheelchairs while continuing to improve their current products.

And while the business moves forward Bagg continues to reap the rewards of his labour.

Out on the trails he is managing long steep climbs navigating over rocky pathways and squeezing through tight trails.

""You get that sort of euphoric effort you know sweating and heart pounding and you're there with your friends on their bikes and they're feeling the same thing"" he said.

Michael Langley becomes the Marine Corps' first Black four-star general,"U.S. Marine Corps Gen. Michael E. Langley was promoted to the rank of general on Aug. 6 2022 in a ceremony at Marine Corps Barracks Washington.

Commandant of the Marine Corps Gen. David Berger promoted Langley who became the first Black Marine to be promoted to general.

""43 years we go from our first African American general to now our first - I think leading to many more - four-star African American generals"" said Berger paying homage to Lt. Gen. Frank E. Peterson.

Langley was joined by friends and family at the ceremony including his father Willie C. Langley who is a proud Air Force veteran. Gen. Langley repeatedly talked about his father as his greatest mentor.

""My daddy told me to aim high so I aimed as high as I could and found the few and the proud” said Gen. Langley a comment which was met with laughter amongst the crowd most of whom were Marines.

Langley was born in Shreveport Louisiana and grew up on a variety of military bases as a child before settling in Texas. He graduated from the University of Texas at Arlington and commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in 1985. Langley has served in the Marine Corps for 37 years and saw his promotion as a sign to others that Marine Corps service rewards those who work hard to achieve their goals.

""The milestone and what it means to the Corps is quite essential. Not because the mark in history but what it will affect going forward especially for those younger across society that want to aspire and look at the Marine Corps as an opportunity"" said Gen. Langley.

At an Aug. 5 briefing at the Johnson Space Center about the upcoming uncrewed Artemis 1 mission Reid Weisman the chief of the astronaut office said he expected the four-person crew who will fly on Artemis 2 to be selected soon.

“The question everyone will ask is when are we assigning a crew to Artemis 2? We hope that will be later this year” he said. That mission is expected to launch no earlier than 2024.

Artemis 2 will be the first crewed flight of Orion going around the moon on a flight lasting about 10 days. The four-person crew will include one Canadian astronaut as part of a December 2020 agreement between NASA and the Canadian Space Agency regarding Canada’s contribution of the Canadarm3 robotic arm for the lunar Gateway.

NASA has not stated if any other international partners such as Europe or Japan will fly astronauts on Artemis 2. As for the agency’s own astronauts Wiseman said the entire 42-person astronaut corps will be considered for that mission and later Artemis flights.

“The way I look at it any one of our 42 active astronauts is eligible for an Artemis mission” he said a point he emphasized several times during the briefing. “We want to assemble the right team for this mission.”

That is a change from late 2020 when NASA unveiled an “Artemis Team” of 18 astronauts that agency leadership at the time along with then-Vice President Mike Pence said would form a pool from which NASA would select crews for at least initial Artemis missions.

“My fellow Americans I give you the heroes of the future who will carry us back to the moon and beyond the Artemis generation” Pence said at a December 2020 National Space Council meeting where he announced the 18 astronauts who would comprise the team. Five of the 18 attended that meeting at the Kennedy Space Center.

Jim Bridenstine NASA administrator at the time said more astronauts would be added in the future including those from international partners. “This is our first cadre of our Artemis astronauts” Bridenstine said. “I want to be clear: there’s going to be more.”

Wiseman though emphasized that he would consider all current astronauts as well as 10 astronaut candidates currently in training. “We have 42 active astronauts here in Houston and 10 astronaut candidates who will be beating down the door for Artemis 2 and beyond” he said.

He added that NASA has also changed lifetime radiation exposure requirements which previously varied by age and gender to a single limit. A June 2021 report by the National Academies endorsed such a proposal noting it “creates equality of opportunity for spaceflight” over the previous standards that set lower limits for women.

Wiseman said those earlier “draconian” standards had been replaced by a single limit. “We have equalized all radiation limits. It does not matter whether you’re a man whether you’re a woman it is the exact same.”

“Our end goal is the United States of America is half men half women. Well space should be at least that” he said. “If we cannot make these spacecraft equitable and we can’t fly any type of person on them then we need to look at our systems and reevaluate.”

There are also no age restrictions on Artemis mission assignments he said noting the astronaut corps includes people with ages ranging from the late 20s to the mid-60s. “As long as you are healthy we’re going to load you on a rocket and shoot you off the planet.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9jYWxnYXJ5L2FkYXB0aXZlLWJpa2VzLWJvd2hlYWQtY29ycC0xLjY1NDIwNjfSASBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYmMuY2EvYW1wLzEuNjU0MjA2Nw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An accident left this man unable to bike the mountain trails he loves. So he innovated,"More than two decades ago Christian Bagg ended up in a wheelchair after a snowboarding crash. It left him paralyzed from the waist down. An avid outdoorsman the Calgarian tried everything he could to get back to the great outdoors. Eventually he found a way.

When Christian Bagg broke his back and became paralyzed from the waist down 26 years ago he was worried he wouldn't be able to continue doing the things he loved like snowboarding climbing and biking.

But with a background in machining he figured why not invent a solution? As an apprentice with the University of Calgary's engineering department he was able to set his ideas in motion.

More than two decades later Bagg is back to gravel racing cyclocross racing and riding mountain trails — all while using an adaptive bike he created.

""Necessity is the mother of invention"" Bagg said.

""We want the world of biking to be as vast for the adaptive crowd as it is for the able-bodied crowd.""

Bagg is the founder of Bowhead Corp. an adaptive off-road biking company based in Calgary that aims to give people with disabilities better access to the outdoors.

The company has sold bikes to people across the world Bagg says from Chile to Norway to Australia. The bikes were also just featured on a recent episode of the Amazing Race Canada.

Other adaptive bikes do exist but he found them either bulky or unable to manoeuvre over the uneven trails he wanted to explore. Wheelchairs didn't work either as they'd tip over on unstable ground.

""The mechanism of the bike allows one wheel to be higher and one wheel to be lower"" he said.

""We're going through nature over obstacles side slopes leaning into corners and really creating a three-wheel version of a two-wheel bike — and it really just fits seamlessly with the way a cyclist would ride.""

Originally Bagg just wanted to be able to hike with his friends and family again. But then he met a young girl with cerebral palsy and saw her reaction to his invention.

""At that moment that's when it was like OK this has to be for everybody.""

Baggs says they've created two bikes so far and a third will be released this fall. They'd also like to produce adaptive wheelchairs. (David Mercer/CBC)

The company moved from the basement to an office space just two years ago. Its team has expanded to include engineers content creators and athletes who've experienced injuries.

People are using the bikes to jump at bike parks walk their dogs or compete alongside able-bodied athletes Bagg says.

""Often with adaptive equipment you're limited by the equipment. But in this scenario you're really only limited by yourself as to what you can do.""

Bowhead bikes

Bowhead Corp. has come out with two bike models so far with a third on the way.

One is an all-electric bike which some quadriplegic bikers can use due to adapted handlebars. The other is operated by a hand crank but it does have a motor for assistance.

""We're very unique in the world as far as our technology goes"" Bagg said.

""The suspension is independent from the leaning. The leaning is independent from the steering. So this level of control is unique.""

Max Flowerday is an engineer-in-training with the team's research and development department. To him the bikes are great at simulating a more traditional mountain biking experience.

""What the articulating front does is it allows the rider to actually lean into the corner and ride in the same way that a non-adaptive bike would ride. So that's super important"" he said.

""It's not like you're riding a shopping cart. You're riding something that really provides this immersive experience.""

Max Flowerday says he always wanted to apply his engineering education to the sporting goods industry. When he found Bowhead it was a perfect fit he says. (David Mercer/CBC)

It's important for the designers to think through all the details closely. Flowerday says he came up with an idea to ensure the bike chain wouldn't derail since some of the company's customers would find it difficult to troubleshoot that problem on the fly.

""Something we're trying to focus on is making these bikes as reliable as possible.""

The designs are also evolving and when a bike is improved the new parts are compatible with older models. Bagg says he wanted customers to be able to swap out components to personalize their ride.

""I know what our customers can do now. I want to see what they can do in five years if we all put our brain power together at Bowhead and give them something amazing"" he said.

'It's just freedom'

Gustavo Ortiz a mountain bike racer from Chile is back competing after discovering the company.

He was injured while visiting Whistler five years ago and says it was difficult to get excited about sports again. When he got onto one of Bowhead's bikes his passion was rekindled he said.

""It's just freedom for me. It's like I can get anywhere I want with no help"" he said. ""I'm really stoked about it.""

He has already attended some competitions in Canada this summer and plans to continue working around the circuit.

Gustavo Ortiz says he's been racing all over the world since he was 12 years old and has always loved bikes. (David Mercer/CBC)

It's stories like this that keep pushing the Bowhead team forward. Bagg says they're continuing to evolve and want to expand to adaptive wheelchairs while continuing to improve their current products.

And while the business moves forward Bagg continues to reap the rewards of his labour.

Out on the trails he is managing long steep climbs navigating over rocky pathways and squeezing through tight trails.

""You get that sort of euphoric effort you know sweating and heart pounding and you're there with your friends on their bikes and they're feeling the same thing"" he said.

""It's something that I thought that I had lost that I got back with that bike.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgJodHRwczovL3d3dy50YXBpbnRvLm5ldC90b3ducy9yb3NlbGxlLXBhcmsvc2VjdGlvbnMvZWR1Y2F0aW9uL2FydGljbGVzL25ldy1qZXJzZXkteW91dGgtY29ycHMtbm93LWVucm9sbGluZy15b3V0aC1iZXR3ZWVuLXRoZS1hZ2VzLW9mLTE2LWFuZC0yNS13aG8td2lzaC10by1vYnRhaW4tYS1oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC1lcXVpdmFsZW5jeS1kaXBsb21hLWRldmVsb3Atd29ya2ZvcmNlLXNraWxscy1hbmQtYWNxdWlyZS1jb21tdW5pdHktc2VydmljZS1leHBlcmllbmNl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Jersey Youth Corps Now Enrolling Youth Between the Ages of 16 and 25 Who Wish to Obtain a High School ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.tapinto.net/towns/roselle-park/sections/education/articles/new-jersey-youth-corps-now-enrolling-youth-between-the-ages-of-16-and-25-who-wish-to-obtain-a-high-school-equivalency-diploma-develop-workforce-skills-and-acquire-community-service-experience on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgJodHRwczovL3d3dy50YXBpbnRvLm5ldC90b3ducy9yb3NlbGxlLXBhcmsvc2VjdGlvbnMvZWR1Y2F0aW9uL2FydGljbGVzL25ldy1qZXJzZXkteW91dGgtY29ycHMtbm93LWVucm9sbGluZy15b3V0aC1iZXR3ZWVuLXRoZS1hZ2VzLW9mLTE2LWFuZC0yNS13aG8td2lzaC10by1vYnRhaW4tYS1oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC1lcXVpdmFsZW5jeS1kaXBsb21hLWRldmVsb3Atd29ya2ZvcmNlLXNraWxscy1hbmQtYWNxdWlyZS1jb21tdW5pdHktc2VydmljZS1leHBlcmllbmNl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb2xkY29hc3RidWxsZXRpbi5jb20uYXUvc3BvcnQvY29tbW9ud2VhbHRoLWdhbWVzL2NvbW1vbndlYWx0aC1nYW1lcy0yMDIyLWVtbWEtbWNrZW9ucy1zZWNyZXQtdGVhcnMtaW4tYmF0dGxlLWZvci1pbW1vcnRhbGl0eS9uZXdzLXN0b3J5L2I3OTFlYTVhMTU0NzJkYWI0N2I2YmY2ZjE0MWFkM2Yy0gG5AWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGRjb2FzdGJ1bGxldGluLmNvbS5hdS9zcG9ydC9jb21tb253ZWFsdGgtZ2FtZXMvY29tbW9ud2VhbHRoLWdhbWVzLTIwMjItZW1tYS1tY2tlb25zLXNlY3JldC10ZWFycy1pbi1iYXR0bGUtZm9yLWltbW9ydGFsaXR5L25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvYjc5MWVhNWExNTQ3MmRhYjQ3YjZiZjZmMTQxYWQzZjI_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McKeon’s secret tears in battle for immortality,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/sport/commonwealth-games/commonwealth-games-2022-emma-mckeons-secret-tears-in-battle-for-immortality/news-story/b791ea5a15472dab47b6bf6f141ad3f2 on URL https://news.google.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_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

As recently as February one of its developers NextEra Energy warned that the many legal and regulatory obstacles meant there was “a very low probability of pipeline completion.”

Then came Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and his hold on the Democrats’ climate agenda.

Mr. Manchin’s recent surprise agreement to back the Biden administration’s historic climate legislation came about in part because the senator was promised something in return: not only support for the pipeline in his home state but also expedited approval for pipelines and other infrastructure nationwide as part of a wider set of concessions to fossil fuels.

It was a big win for a pipeline industry that in recent years has quietly become one of Mr. Manchin’s biggest financial supporters.

Natural gas pipeline companies have dramatically increased their contributions to Mr. Manchin from just $20000 in 2020 to more than $331000 so far this election cycle according to campaign finance disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission and tallied by the Center for Responsive Politics. Mr. Manchin has been by far Congress’s largest recipient of money from natural gas pipeline companies this cycle raising three times as much from the industry than any other lawmaker.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9wZXJzb25hbC1maW5hbmNlLzIwMjIvMDgvMDcvbW90bGV5LWZvb2wtbmV4dGVyYS1lbmVyZ3ktaXMtd29ybGRzLWxhcmdlc3QtcHJvZHVjZXItb2Ytc29sYXItYW5kLXdpbmQtcG93ZXIv0gGdAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3BlcnNvbmFsLWZpbmFuY2UvMjAyMi8wOC8wNy9tb3RsZXktZm9vbC1uZXh0ZXJhLWVuZXJneS1pcy13b3JsZHMtbGFyZ2VzdC1wcm9kdWNlci1vZi1zb2xhci1hbmQtd2luZC1wb3dlci8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Motley Fool: NextEra Energy is world’s largest producer of solar and wind power,"The Motley Fool Take

NextEra Energy is a mixture of a regulated utility (it owns Florida Power & Light the largest U.S. utility) and a clean-energy business. Over the past 15 years this combination has led to average annualized growth in adjusted earnings per share of 8.4%. That’s an impressive number since utility stocks are generally thought of as slow and steady performers.

NextEra also lays claim to being Earth’s largest producer of solar and wind power and it aims to roughly double this capacity within three years. Solar and wind are real growth businesses for the company which plans to spend as much as $95 billion on capital investments between 2022 and 2025 (while increasing storage capacity as much as eightfold).

Some near-term headwinds including supply chain disruptions and tariff issues have caused investor concerns and pushed the shares lower; they recently sat nearly 16% below their 52-week highs. Over the past decade though shares have risen by more than 18% annually on average (20% with dividends reinvested).

Ask the Fool

From H.L. in Denver: What’s a “poison pill” in the business world?

Advertisement

The Fool responds: It’s a strategy often labeled something like a “limited duration shareholder rights plan” that companies occasionally employ to deter takeover attempts. The threat of it alone can be enough to send would-be acquirers packing.

As an example in 2012 activist investor Carl Icahn bought up 9.98% of Netflix shares apparently positioning himself to start calling for changes at the company.

Netflix responded by implementing a poison pill strategy that would be triggered once a single investor owned 10% of shares (or an institutional investor owned 20%). At that point the company would flood the market with additional shares that were available at a discount to shareholders other than the would-be acquirer. That would have significantly diluted the value of Icahn’s shares. Icahn called the move “really reprehensible” and later began selling many shares abandoning his pursuit of Netflix.

From B.B. in Scappoose Ore.: Is it OK to have several IRA accounts?

Advertisement

The Fool responds: Sure. You might invest some money in a traditional IRA and also have a Roth IRA. (They offer different tax benefits with the former giving you an upfront tax break and the latter the possibility of tax-free withdrawals in retirement.) If you change jobs you might take whatever 401(k) money you’ve accumulated and roll that into a new IRA account so that you can manage and invest that sum separately.

As long as you can keep track of the accounts it’s fine. Note that the maximum IRA contribution in 2022 is $6000 plus an additional $1000 for those 50 and older. That’s a total maximum so you could park $3000 in one IRA and $3000 in another this year but not $6000 in each.

The Fool’s School

When seeking the most compelling companies in which to invest be sure to look for competitive advantages. A business that has an edge ideally sustainable is far less vulnerable to existing rivals or new competitors stealing market share from it. Here are some examples of competitive advantages:

Advertisement

Strong brands: A strong brand can give a company pricing power enabling it to raise prices without losing too much business. It can also draw customers. For example many consumers view shoes by Nike or Vans as preferable to other brands.

Bargaining power: When a company is large others will want to do business with it and may be willing to make concessions for that. Walmart for example can get favorable treatment from would-be suppliers.

Low production costs: If two companies make the same thing but one can make it less expensively that company has an edge.

Switching costs: If a company can get customers entrenched in its offerings it can be hard for them to switch to a rival. If you’ve had a Gmail account for many years for example you’ll likely be reluctant to change email providers.

Advertisement

Network effect: With a network effect a company’s offering gets stronger when more people use it. For example an online marketplace with the most buyers will attract the most sellers — and vice versa.

Intellectual property: Ideas and processes that can be legally protected by copyrights or patents give companies a leg up. A company might also have proprietary technology such as effective algorithms that helps it outperform its peers.

Differentiation: If you can distinguish your product from others by something other than price such as quality or design you may be able to charge more for it.

Ecosystem: Connected offerings can be powerful. If you already have an iPhone and a MacBook you might prefer to buy an Apple Watch over a different wearable because you’re entrenched in Apple’s ecosystem.

Some of the best-performing companies have multiple competitive advantages.

My Dumbest Investment

From W.F. online: My dumbest investment was buying shares of Unity at its peak and losing more than half my money. That’s what I get for believing the hype.

The Fool responds: Positive opinions on a stock aren’t necessarily hype. Those who study companies can be bullish (optimistic) about the prospects for a business making perfectly reasonable arguments. At the same time others might be bearish (pessimistic) about the same business. Stock analysts are rarely if ever fully in agreement and many times companies won’t end up performing as expected.

Many stocks have been whacked by the recent market downturn and video game software specialist Unity Software is among the hardest hit with shares down some 80% from their highest point over the past year. That’s partly due to the company revealing issues with its machine learning due to “bad data.” It’s working to fix them and is moving to acquire another company ironSource that has technology it can use.

This investment may turn out to be not so dumb if some analysts are correct. They foresee Unity solving its problems becoming more profitable due to ironSource and continuing to grow revenue at double-digit rates. Others though dislike Unity’s plans to finance the acquisition by issuing more stock diluting the value of existing shares — and to fix that problem by spending $2.5 billion to buy back shares. Do some research and see what you think.

So whenever one of the most recognizable sportswear brands on the planet takes a loss it goes down in the history books. One of Nike's biggest misfires occurred in 2013 during a botched meeting with Golden State Warriors point guard Stephen Curry.

At the time the 25-year-old phenom showed true promise but had not yet won any of his four NBA Championships two regular season MVP awards or even made a single All-Star appearance.

Curry had worn Nike throughout the first four years of his professional career but his first sneaker deal was ready to expire. So the Curry family took pitch meetings with all of the major sneaker companies.

An upstart company known as Under Armour offered $4 million per year plus a signature shoe and the chance to become the face of the company. Nike whose offer was worth $2.5 million per year declined its right to match the Under Armour money.

But Nike's meeting went horribly wrong when one of their representatives mispronounced Curry's name calling him ""Steph-on"" instead of ""Steph-en."" Even worse a repurposed PowerPoint slide displayed Kevin Durant's name.

The botched meeting became folklore among hoopers and sneakerheads alike. But like most stories that take on a life of their own there are often missing facts. Besides Nike no one's reputation took a bigger hit than Nico Harrison.

Harrison was Nike's Vice President of North American basketball operations and was known for his trustworthiness and deep personal connections with the NBA's most popular players. Most notably Kobe Bryant.

Harrison has had his name attached to the infamous 2013 meeting for nine years. Now the 49-year-old serves as the Dallas Mavericks general manager. Thanks to the Point Forward podcast hosted by Andre Iguodala and Evan Turner fans finally received some clarification about Harrison's role in the meeting.

Turner a former NBA player coach and serious sneakerhead had to ask Harrison about what actually happened that day. Harrison provided the following answer:

""There is an article out. And the article says I mispronounced his name. It wasn't me. It absolutely wasn't me. But they didn't know the other person they knew me. So they say I mispronounced his name because it's sexy. But I'm like first of all I've known this guy forever like since he was in high school. I used to represent his dad. How am I going to mispronounce his name? I might have called him Seth but I wasn't going to mispronounce his name. So yeah Nike made a mistake. In all honesty if he would have stayed with Nike his business would be a monster right now. A monster.""

So Curry's first name was mispronounced but not by Harrison. You can listen to the entire segment at the 44:20 mark in the latest episode.

The rest is history. Curry signed Under Armour's offer sheet in 2013 before inking a nine-year contract extension in 2015. Then in November 2020 Under Armour announced the launch of the Curry Brand.

Since partnering with Under Armour Curry's signature sneaker line has released nine models. Just yesterday the perennial All-NBA point guard debuted his upcoming 10th sneaker - the Curry 10.

Nike's failure to retain Curry will go down in the history books and be taught in business schools for years to come. Thanks to the Point Forward podcast we finally know both sides of the story and can clear Harrison's name of the gaff. Stay locked into FanNation Kicks for breaking news updates and interviews.

We may receive compensation when you click on links to those products. The opinions and information provided on this site are original editorial content of Sneaker News.

The Nike Pegasus Turbo Next Nature is a fairly-novel addition to the Nike Running lineup of products but it’s quickly garnered a loyal fanbase due to its sustainability and performance accomplishments.

Recently the ZoomX-cushioned silhouette emerged in a special “5 Borough Tour” colorway that’s sure to capture attention during any of the sanctioned or unofficial races taking place across New York City for the remainder of the year. Black and green-colored FlyKnit (of which 100% is recycled yarn) make up the bulk of the sneaker with hits of vibrant crimson joining the mix via swoosh logos and other accents. Midsoles and traction don’t deliver much on the aesthetics-front but are attractive when viewed through the lens of eco-consciousness and performance given the years of testing that’ve gone into not only the Nike Pegasus line but also the brand’s future-forward tooling solutions.

Enjoy official images of the pair ahead and anticipate a Nike.com launch as the end of 2022 inches closer.

Dauda Kahutu Rarara has over the years established himself as President Muhammadu Buhari’s singer and has done a lot in promoting the president via music. Recently the singer brought together a group of entertainers under the name 13X13 and he has openly shown allegiance to Ahmed Tinubu’s candidature. In this interview the singer talks about a special prayer session organized by the group among other issues in the entertainment sector.

What was the reason behind the special prayer session recently held for Nigeria?

As the president of 13X13 a group of Northern entertainers and other stakeholders in the entertainment industry I believe we all have a stake in the development of this nation irrespective of what one is involved in. It is apparent that the security agencies are doing their best and the government also is doing its best to see that the good people of Nigeria live in peace and harmony.

As faithful believers we believe that committing this nation to divine intervention is what we need to do hence we decided to hold a special prayer session to seek God’s intervention on the present predicaments faced by Nigeria especially in the northern region. That is why we organized the special prayer session.

Is it true that the prayer session was meant for Tinubu?

That is absolutely not true; we are talking about the unity and continued existence of Nigeria as a nation here and not an individual candidate or group of candidates. It is only when peace security and unity are relatively present in a nation that you can talk about who governs it. Nigeria is greater than all of us and our main aim is to see that we have contributed in returning back its lost glory as a nation.

Everyone has a role to play in restoring our lost glory as a nation we as entertainers gathered here to recite the Holy Qur’an and pray for the nation.

The security agencies the government and other relevant stakeholders have a vital role to play in restoring peace to this noble nation likewise the entertainment industry in the North and in all other regions. What Nigeria needs is divine intervention and that is why we organized this special prayer session with all stakeholders in the Northern entertainment industry to pray for peace and the unity of Nigeria. It is apparent that without peace nothing will move as expected.

Is the prayer session connected to the fact that some Nollywood artists were kidnapped recently?

It is not. However it is indeed very sad that those considered to be our colleagues were kidnapped. It is unfortunate and we sympathize with them and also pray for their safe return to their respective families and their profession. As I said earlier the prayer session is for the entire nation and not for a particular segment.

Is it true that 13X13 is not an entertainment platform but a political formation?

No we formed the group to promote entertainment with more vigour. We believe as entertainers we will do more if we have a unified structure that can do something positive and in the best manner possible.

The group is aimed at assisting each other to do what we do in a better way we want to ensure mutual support of our members as well as for our practicing and none practicing artistes.

It was revealed that the Hausa entertainment industry has been divided by political affiliation is that true?

No it is not true we belong to everyone and political affiliation will not divide us. We are one big family that pursue the goals of educating entertaining and promoting sociocultural virtues of our region.

Everyone has a right to align to a political platform he or she feels comfortable with at individual level and when it comes to our profession we see ourselves as artistes and not politicians.

Therefore irrespective of one’s political alignment entertainment is above any other engagements.

How would you rate the current entertainment industry?

The entertainment industry has gradually become a game changer. It is one of the few institution that provides employment to millions of people and it has become a strong pillar in societal reorientation.

The industry is also contributing to the promotion of the nation’s revenue generation as well as contributing citizen’s lawful earnings.

Entertainment has become everybody’s business today and I believe the sky is the limit for the industry.

What do you think is responsible for the insecurity issues in Nigeria?

I strongly believe that the major issue responsible for the nation’s present predicament is unemployment. Owing to the fact that jobs are not available some citizens take to violence and dubious ways to make ends meet. They get involved in vices like robbery fraud prostitution rituals pocket picking and so on.

When there is no source of income poverty sets in. Citizens are unable to feed and clothe themselves. Some people engage in disguised employment which is a situation where you earn less than you deserve or qualify for. The quality of life is reduced because of unemployment.

What is your reaction to the recent police directive that artistes should notify security when going out to film locations?

Let me speak on Kano State. I am aware that there has been a dedicated unit in the police saddled with the responsibility of giving artists on location the needed security. Producers don’t go out to locations without obtaining a permit from this unit and the unit ensures that the needed security is provided.

In a nutshell we do not have such issues in Kano State and even if we do I am confident that our members will definitely abide by the new directives.

Why are you supporting Tinubu this time around?

First of all don’t forget that I am a Nigerian and I have every right to support who I want to support based on personal valid reasons. Moreover my candidate has distinguished himself as a capable leader.

Lagos is what it is today because he did all the needful for it to remain calm and peaceful.

Aug. 4 2022 — Following a successful launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida today the U.S. Space Force is now communicating with the sixth Space Based Infrared System Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (SBIRS GEO) -6 satellite built by Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT).

The final satellite in the SBIRS program series GEO-6 joins the U.S. Space Force’s constellation of missile warning satellites equipped with powerful scanning and staring infrared surveillance sensors.

“The need for Overhead Persistent Infrared systems has never been more critical” said Michael Corriea vice president of Lockheed Martin Space’s Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) Mission Area. “At Lockheed Martin we are making advancements to keep pace with evolving needs based on emerging threats in our military customers’ environment helping pave the way for the future.”

The GEO-6 satellite is a stepping stone toward the resilient missile warning to be provided by SBIRS’ successor the Next Generation OPIR GEO System (NGG). Like SBIRS GEO-5 and GEO-6 NGG will be based on Lockheed Martin’s modernized LM 2100 Combat Bus™ which provides additional capabilities such as cyber hardening resiliency features enhanced spacecraft power and improved propulsion and electronics.

The SBIRS GEO-6 satellite is responding to the U.S. Space Force’s commands as planned. Signal acquisition was confirmed 3 hours and 43 minutes after the satellite’s 6:29 a.m. EDT lift off aboard a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket. The satellite is now orbiting under its own propulsion following separation from the rocket. The onboard sensors collect data that allow the U.S. military to detect missile launches support ballistic missile defense expand technical intelligence gathering and bolstering situational awareness on the battlefield.

A Step Toward More Resiliency

The OPIR mission has become more critical as ballistic missile technology has proliferated around the world with over 1000 missile launches tracked annually. Lockheed Martin recognizes that modernized technology is needed to augment the current missile warning architecture and improve resiliency against attacks.

“SBIRS GEO-6 fortifies the current missile warning architecture and it also signifies that we are on our way to achieving even greater technological capacity and expanded coverage with NGG” Corriea said.

Lockheed Martin is proud to be part of the SBIRS team led by Space Systems Command’s Space Sensing Directorate at Los Angeles Air Force Base. Lockheed Martin Space Sunnyvale California is the SBIRS prime contractor with Northrop Grumman of Azusa California as the payload supplier.

The art of reading the room is one of the most important tools that a performer can master when executing a presentation. When we spoke to Garth Brooks at the pre-show press conference he had the following to say about the room he was set to perform in on Saturday night in Houston.""It's always been a guaranteed good time here so it's fun! They know their country music and I think I am now finally in a room full of George Strait fans so that's fantastic! Its also easier to talk to people when they're five feet in front of you than when they're across the dirt"" declared Brooks referencing his previous performances at RodeoHouston.Saturday night was the last stop onfor Garth Brooks and his crew and he vowed to bring everything to the NRG Stadium stage and promised a once-in-a-lifetime experience for his fans.There certainly was a palpable electricity as we walked into the arena from Kirby Drive. It was a sea of cowboy boots lovely couples and hardcore Garth fans who showed up to witness one of the world's greatest entertainers light the stage on fire with his No. 1 hits deep album cuts and several surprises throughout the evening.After a duo of opening acts hit the stage it was finally time for the main event. The lights dimmed low as Garth's band and backup singers moved into position. That's when we heard a familiar computer-generated voice over the speakers:""Alexa... play Garth Brooks live from Houston Texas!""A loud road could be heard and felt as the band rumbled the first few notes of the opening track ""All Day Long"". And then there he was entering the stage in grand fashion elevated from a hidden platform underneath the drum set in the middle of the massive stage... Mr. Garth Brooks.""Somebody's got to start the weekend somebody's gotta get all rowdy and raise some hell in here!"" sang Brooks as he grabbed his guitar and paced across the performance platform. Wearing his signature mouthpiece microphone black cowboy hat and boots the man named Garth quickly won over this crowd by displaying immense love and energy towards the capacity crowd in the arena.""Tell me it's going to be like this all night long!"" yelled Brooks as he waved at the crowd blowing kisses and making the heart gesture with his hands as he thanked everyone for the love. He completed the opening trio of songs with ""Rodeo"" and ""The Beaches Of Cheyanne"".There a thing that Garth does at his shows where he acknowledges his fans in the crowd and reads their handmade signs and if those signs have a song request on them he will venture off-script and entertain that request. He did this several times during last night's show the first time was for the fan favorite ballad ""She's Every Woman.""After that number Brooks smiled and laughed with a super wide grin. ""If we're just going to throw the set list away then I guess we better start now!"" He then proceeded to perform a heartfelt cover of ""Amarillo By Morning"" by George Strait standing side by side with his fiddle player on one of the stage runways illuminated by three spotlights beaming down from the rafters.It was supremely noticeable that Garth was enjoying every second of the evening soaking in the moments and reciprocating the energy that his fans dedicated his way. He thanked the Lord for the ability to play this last show inside an air-conditioned stadium not having to worry about the weather.""I am the captain of this ship"" he said with a chuckle. ""I could do this every night! Its my turn to dictate the weather and I say let the thunder roll!"" And yes that's exactly when he performed extended version of his all-time hit ""The Thunder Rolls.""This moment occurred 10 songs into the night and there was still 20 more songs on the set list! He was definitely prepared to pay any overtime penalties if the show ran overtime. He began right around 9:15pm and the last notes from his guitar stopped vibrating at 11:36pm.""Some of these songs are older than most of you in this stadium"" he laughed as he played ""If Tomorrow Never Comes"" ""Everytime That It Rains"" and ""The Dance"" from his debut album from the year 1989.The last song before the two encores was the ultimate Garth Brooks fan favorite ""Friends In Low Places"". Now I'm sure we've all sung this track before... in the car at karaoke at a wedding. They have even made it a habit to play it in between innings at the Houston Astros games which is always a fun time.But let me tell you what (in my most country Southern drawl)... this song live is an absolute masterpiece. The set up the punchline the payoff and that third verse. Houston really showed out last night singing along as loud as I've ever heard a crowd do so inside NRG. The ground shook and the walls vibrated due to how hard and loud everybody sang along. It was truly a magical moment.And just as you thought the show was winding down a certain Mrs. Trisha Yearwood joined her husband onstage to sing a cover of ""Shallow"" from the movie. She was bedazzling in a pantsuit covered in rainbow sparkles with a microphone to match. The audience went absolutely wild to see her on stage and cheered with immense joy when she followed with ""She's In Love With The Boy"".Encore No. 1 ended with appropriately with ""Standing Outside The Fire."" After his band retired to the dressing rooms and Garth took a quick break he appeared once again front and center. He picked up his guitar and played a trio of acoustic covers that punctuated the night perfectly.First up was ""Piano Man"" by Billy Joel. Even without the harmonica solo Garth showed us why the track is an all-time classic composition of American music history. He followed that with the third verse of the country music standard ""You Never Even Called Me By My Name"" by Steve Goodman although most fans are most familiar with the David Allen Coe version.The final song of the night was ""American Pie"" by Don McLean. Heartfelt emotional and a perfect way to say goodbye.Thank you Mr. Brooks for an absolutely fantastic evening. There have certainly been a few amazing performances throughout the 20-year history of NRG Stadium but this show on this night was probably the best I've ever seen. It was an honor to be inside the building and singing along with almost 100000 Houstonians that will never forget this night.As we walked out of the stadium down the long hallways and into the hot summer air the fans didn't want the party to end. A group of friends began to sing ""Friends In Low Places"" and that led to everyone around them singing along. A beautiful way to end an equally beautiful night.",,,,,,,,,
NUE,Nucor,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpZ25hbHNhei5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvbnVjb3ItdG8tYWRkLW1lbHQtc2hpcC1hdC1raW5nbWFuLWJhci1taWxsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nucor to Add Melt Ship at Kingman Bar Mill,"Article audio is made possible by CAST11 Prescott Podcast Network. A Talking Glass Media production.

Nucor the largest steel and steel products producer in the U.S. announced today it is investing $100 million to add a new electric arc furnace melt shop at its existing bar mill in Kingman Arizona. The melt shop which will have the capacity to produce 600000 tons annually is expected to be operational by 2024 and create approximately 140 new jobs.

“Nucor’s expansion and resulting high-wage jobs will greatly contribute to the economic prosperity of our city and region” said Kingman Mayor Jen Miles. “Their investment adds to Kingman’s growing manufacturing base and in doing so will create exciting new opportunities for our citizens. We welcome Nucor’s expansion and thank them for their positive and ongoing commitment and contributions to our city.”

“This investment in a new melt shop at our Arizona bar mill is part of our strategy to grow our core steelmaking business and will help us maintain our market leadership position in steel bar production” said Leon Topalian President and Chief Executive Officer of Nucor Corporation. “Adding new melt shop capacity will help meet the growing demand for steel bar products in the Western region which is one of the fastest growing areas in the U.S.”

Nucor chose to build a new melt shop at Nucor Steel Kingman as it is a rolling mill that converts steel billets into coiled wire rod and rebar but lacks a melt shop. The Kingman mill currently employs approximately 80 people.

Wire rod and rebar are used primarily in concrete reinforcement for the construction of roads buildings bridges and other structures. Nucor produces steel by recycling scrap metal into new steel products making the company one of the most sustainable steel producers in the world. Last year Nucor steel bar products averaged 98.5% recycled content.

“Nucor’s significant expansion in Kingman adds to the surge in manufacturing activity in Mohave County while supporting construction and other high-value industries” said Sandra Watson President and CEO of the Arizona Commerce Authority. “We are grateful for Nucor’s commitment to Arizona adding hundreds of high-wage jobs in rural Arizona and driving further economic growth.”

Nucor has 15 bar mills located across the United States that manufacture a broad range of steel products including concrete reinforcing bars hot-rolled bars rounds light shapes structural angles channels wire rod and highway products in carbon and alloy steels. Four of the bar mills have a significant focus on manufacturing SBQ and wire rod products. Steel produced by Nucor bar mills serves numerous end markets including the agricultural automotive construction energy furniture machinery metal building railroad recreational equipment shipbuilding heavy truck and trailer market segments.

NVDA,Nvidia,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA4LzA3L3doeS1udmlkaWEtanVtcGVkLTE5OC1pbi1qdWx5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Nvidia Stock Rose More Than 19% in July,"After a rough start to the month Nvidia stock climbed thanks to expected government legislation.

What happened

Shares of semiconductor company Nvidia (NVDA -1.84%) rose 19.8% in July according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Investors had few reasons for optimism at the start of July with Nvidia tumbling 15.3% in the first week. The stock continued to fall two weeks into the month as analysts reduced its target price and prepared for disappointing quarterly results in mid-August. However the stock began to soar on July 15 as drafted legislation concerning semiconductor production picked up steam.

So what

At the start of July fellow chip company Micron Technology released quarterly predictions 45% lower than Wall Street's expectations. The company's stock subsequently fell 6% with a domino effect leading Nvidia stock to fall 3.3%.

As a result multiple analysts cut their price target for Nvidia stock. Bank of America's Vivek Arya cut the target price from $270 to $220 while continuing to recommend the stock as a buy. Then on July 8 Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners retained his buy recommendation while lowering his price target from $410 per share to $310. Analysts mainly cited reduced consumer spending from economic concerns and a decline in the crypto market for their reduced target prices.

However Nvidia stock rallied 2.2% on July 15 when as reported by Business Insider ""Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's husband Paul Pelosi exercised millions of dollars in Nvidia call options."" The move came ahead of the Chips Act bill drafted in the Senate which would provide $52 billion in subsidies to bolster American semiconductor manufacturing.

News of the bill continued to boost Nvidia stock for the rest of the month with shares popping 16% from July 15 to July 20. Although Nvidia will not directly benefit from the Chips Act as it is a designer and not a manufacturer the company's CEO Jensen Huang has discussed the possibility of partnering with companies like Intel to mitigate supply chain disruptions. The move would help safeguard the business and put Nvidia in a close relationship with a company that would definitely benefit from the expected legislation.

Now what

July was a roller coaster for Nividia as analysts attempted to predict how the company will fare in its coming earnings report. The stock fell 4.1% on July 22 as investors realized the Chips Act wouldn't boost the company as much as previously hoped.

Conversely Nvidia's prior earnings could signify a better quarterly report than analysts would have you believe. The company's 2023 first quarter ended on May 1 with Nvidia reporting a 46% rise in revenue up a record $8.29 billion from the quarter before. In addition the company is gearing up for its Sept. 19-22 GPU Technology Conference where the next generation of high-end graphics cards is expected to be announced. The highly anticipated and long-awaited products could increase demand providing a boost for Nvidia.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvbnZpZGlhLWdlZm9yY2UtZ3R4LTE2NTAtc3VwZXItdnMtYW1kLXJ4LTY1MDAteHTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 Super vs AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT: Sub-$200 GPU Face-Off,"Last year it was nearly impossible to find reasonable prices on the best graphics cards  never mind finding anything that would qualify as a ""budget"" or cheap option. The GeForce GTX 1650 Super and Radeon RX 6500 XT we're looking at today basically weren't available in 2021 despite the former having launched in late 2019 — it was selling for as much as $350 according to our historical GPU pricing data.



2022 has thankfully brought an end to the GPU drought and AMD's Navi 24 cards are selling for less than their official MSRPs. The RX 6500 XT can be had for as little as $180  and the GTX 1650 Super is back in stock as well at least in some places — the EVGA 1650 Super SC goes for around $200 now at Amazon and Newegg as well. Which means we can put these two sub-$200 graphics cards up against each other to see which cheap GPU is the better choice.

We'll look at performance price features and tech drivers and software and power and efficiency in order to determine a winner. Those categories are listed in order of decreasing importance in our view at least so we'll start with the critical aspects and move on down the list from there.

Gaming Performance: GTX 1650 Super vs RX 6500 XT

Gaming remains the main draw for graphics cards though they can also help with video encoding and other tasks — or at least some of them can. Budget GPUs aren't intended for high-resolution gaming instead delivering performance similar to previous-generation midrange and high-end GPUs at substantially lower prices. We put the GTX 1650 Super and RX 6500 XT to the test with our updated 8-game test suite looking at three different settings and resolution combinations.

Swipe to scroll horizontally GeForce GTX 1650 Super vs. Radeon RX 6500 XT Average FPS Game Setting GTX 1650 Super RX 6500 XT % Difference 8 Game Average 1080p Medium 73.7 71.2 3.50% 1080p Ultra 37.1 34.3 8.20% 1440p Ultra 27.3 20.1 35.60% Borderlands 3 1080p Medium 77 81.0 -4.90% 1080p Ultra 38.6 37.1 3.90% 1440p Ultra 26.3 24.2 9.00% Far Cry 6 1080p Medium 80.4 83.1 -3.30% 1080p Ultra 51.7 43.7 18.10% 1440p Ultra 38.9 25.6 51.80% Flight Simulator 1080p Medium 65.1 59.7 9.20% 1080p Ultra 37.4 35.4 5.60% 1440p Ultra 24.9 23.7 5.30% Forza Horizon 5 1080p Medium 82.9 80.2 3.40% 1080p Ultra 30.8 28 10.00% 1440p Ultra 26.4 11.8 123.90% Horizon Zero Dawn 1080p Medium 79.2 71.4 10.80% 1080p Ultra 54.6 56.2 -2.80% 1440p Ultra 42.3 21.9 92.90% Red Dead Redemption 2 1080p Medium 82.4 86.5 -4.70% 1080p Ultra 38.3 30.2 27.00% 1440p Ultra 29.7 24.9 18.90% Total War Warhammer 3 1080p Medium 44.1 33.7 30.90% 1080p Ultra 24.0 17.7 35.80% 1440p Ultra 14.7 10.4 40.30% Watch Dogs Legion 1080p Medium 78.8 74.3 6.10% 1080p Ultra 21.5 26.1 -17.60% 1440p Ultra 14.9 18.3 -18.30%

1080p gaming is the real target for these cards though some lighter games might manage 1440p at lower quality settings. 1440p ultra obviously pushes things too far with sub-30 fps performance in most of the games we tested. So let's just ignore the 1440p ultra numbers and focus on 1080p performance.



It's a bit of a mixed bag with wild swings in relative performance depending on the game. Overall performance at 1080p medium basically ended up a tie with the GTX 1650 Super holding a negligible 2% lead. In the individual games the 1650 Super was anywhere from 4% slower (Borderlands 3) to a whopping 31% faster (Total War: Warhammer 3). But for the most part the two provided a comparable experience.



Bumping the quality settings from medium to ultra creates problems in several of the games which start to use more than the 4GB of VRAM that's available on these GPUs. Forza Horizon 5 Red Dead Redemption 2 Total War: Warhammer 3 and Watch Dogs Legion all see performance basically cut in half sometimes more. Most of the games remained playable meaning 30 fps or more but TWW3 and WDL both dropped below that mark.

Technically AMD's RX 6500 XT has the advantage of also supporting DXR (DirectX Raytracing) which the GTX 1650 Super fails to run (you need a 6GB GTX 10- or 16-series GPU for limited DXR support). However performance in DXR games on the 6500 XT even at 1080p medium is typically so slow as to be meaningless. In our 6-game DXR test suite the RX 6500 XT averaged 13.5 fps and failed to run Control (which requires 6GB or more to enable DXR). Fortnite was the best result at 20 fps while a couple of the games didn't even break 10 fps. Don't bother in other words.



It's interesting what AMD is able to do with significantly less memory bandwidth even with a relatively small 16MB Infinity Cache. The RX 6500 XT has just 144 GB/s of bandwidth compared to 192 GB/s for the GTX 1650 Super due to the 64-bit memory bus on Navi 24. However the 232 GB/s of Infinity Cache bandwidth basically makes up the difference most of the time. It starts to fall short at ultra settings but those mostly aren't playable anyway.



Incidentally while we're only showing average fps the 99th percentile lows are mostly the same story except Nvidia's lead is slightly larger. Overall the GTX 1650 Super was 4.9% faster on minimum fps at 1080p medium 10.0% faster at 1080p ultra and 43.7% faster at 1440p ultra. In other words the framerate consistency was slightly worse on the RX 6500 XT.



While the performance might look like a tie that's using a modern test system that supports the PCIe 4.0 interface. We also tested RX 6500 XT with PCIe 3.0 speeds  and performance dropped by 9% overall but there were instances where it was up to 40% slower. Testing the GTX 1650 Super on the same two PCs showed a 2% improvement in performance on the older Core i9-9900K system so the drop in AMD performance can safely be attributed to the PCIe interface and platform. That gives Nvidia the overall lead for this category.



Winner: Nvidia GTX 1650 Super

Nvidia came out ahead at all three tested settings and resolutions using a modern test PC. 1080p medium performance was pretty much tied and we could throw AMD a bone for its ray tracing hardware. However for budget hardware we feel there's a far greater chance these cards will end up in a PC that doesn't support PCIe 4.0 which means Nvidia gets the lead. Neither one of these GPUs are particularly potent of course. You're getting the equivalent of an RX 580 8GB (but with less VRAM) or a bit faster than a GTX 980 half a decade after those GPUs were in their prime.

Price: GTX 1650 Super vs RX 6500 XT

Prices have been all over the place for most of the past two years though the RX 6500 XT only launched back in January 2022. The GTX 1650 Super originally debuted with a price of just $159 in 2019 and it was an excellent value at the time. Prices trended upward in 2020 and then spiked horrifically in 2021 when the GPU shortages and pandemic-influenced supply chain issues were at their worst. Even now nearly three years after its launch the lowest prices on the GTX 1650 Super are still $200.



Unless you're willing to take a chance with a used card which changes things up slightly. The GTX 1650 Super can be had for around $130 on eBay  while the RX 6500 XT starts at around $150 . Both of those prices are very much estimates as eBay shows far more fluctuations than retail stores. Plus buying a used graphics card represents a risk. The good news is that neither of these GPUs would have been a great option for mining purposes due to having only 4GB of memory so they probably weren’t run into the ground by their former owners.



What's not clear is whether Nvidia is still actively producing the TU116 chips that sit at the heart of the GTX 1650 Super. It hasn't officially discontinued production as far as we're aware but the supply of budget-friendly GTX 16-series cards hasn't been all that great for a while now. The RTX 3050 meanwhile represents a large step up in price performance and features so Nvidia doesn't have a direct replacement for the GTX 1650 Super. And no the GTX 1630 is not the GPU you're looking for [waves hand].

Winner: AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT

Retail pricing trumps eBay pricing and right now you save $20 by going with the AMD RX 6500 XT. Unless Nvidia starts providing a steady supply of TU116 chips — for the GTX 1650 Super as well as the GTX 1660 and GTX 1660 Super — AMD will likely maintain its modest pricing advantage.

Normally newer GPU architectures come with additional features. AMD's Navi 24 and Nvidia's GTX 16-series represent an exception to that rule in different ways.



Despite using the Turing architecture  the GTX 1650 Super doesn't support ray tracing or DLSS — two of the biggest additions to Turing. It does support the improved Turing NVENC hardware which promises higher quality streaming encodes with less of a hit on gaming performance however which does beat Navi 24.



AMD's Navi 24 GPU meanwhile represents some serious cuts to the basic RDNA 2 architecture feature set. There's no video encoding hardware only video decoding hardware. The PCIe interface also gets trimmed to just an x4 link which despite being PCIe 4.0 capable still has half the potential throughput as the GTX 1650 Super's PCIe 3.0 x16 interface. It's also limited to two display outputs typically one HDMI 2.1 and one DisplayPort 1.4.



The one major feature AMD supports with RX 6500 XT that Nvidia does not is ray tracing but as noted earlier it's much more of a checkbox feature than something most people would consider using. Other competing features are mostly comparable like G-Sync vs FreeSync  Reflex vs Anti-Lag etc. You get the same amount of memory (4GB) and both GPUs require a 6-pin (or sometimes 8-pin) power connection.



Winner: Nvidia GTX 1650 Super

We said in our initial review that Navi 24 represented too many cuts to the basic feature set. A 64-bit memory interface x4 PCIe interface and no encoding hardware make this a GPU that feels more like something from five years ago. Sure there's RT hardware but it's only a token effort and is largely useless with only 4GB of memory. This is a close call but ultimately we give Nvidia a slight edge.

Drivers and Software: GTX 1650 Super vs RX 6500 XT

AMD and Nvidia release regular driver updates for their GPUs. In AMD's case the company typically drops larger annual overhauls of its Radeon drivers but the biggest changes in the past couple of years have focused on improving DirectX 11 performance in a few cases and cleaning up bugs. Most major game launches tend to see AMD Game Ready drivers though not necessarily WHQL certified drivers.

Nvidia maintains a similar release schedule for its GeForce drivers. It doesn't always have a monthly driver update but you can count on having Game Ready Drivers on launch day for most major game releases. Nearly every Nvidia driver (outside the occasional hotfix) is WHQL certified. It's an extra step though in practice we're not sure how much it really matters — we've seen UI bugs and other issues still slip through the WHQL process.



AMD and Nvidia have different approaches to their driver user interfaces. Nvidia splits its GeForce driver options into two applications. Nvidia Control Panel handles the GPU settings such as resolution texture filtering vertical sync low latency mode power management and more. The control panel also handles display configuration settings such as color rotation and multi-display setups. Nvidia GeForce Experience handles game settings driver updates and includes game streaming and recording features as well as performance tuning options. To access the GeForce Experience features you must log in with an Nvidia user account.



AMD takes a somewhat more streamlined approach in that the Radeon driver software is a one-stop-shop for all your Radeon GPU settings and features. The Radeon Adrenaline 2022 software suite includes automatic driver updates game performance profiles built-in broadcasting software to stream and record your gameplay and performance metrics and overclocking options.



Winner: Tie



Both Nvidia and AMD have different advantages with their drivers and accompanying software but they offer generally equivalent experiences. Driver updates come on a regular basis and both companies are well versed in testing and tuning their drivers to extract good gaming performance. Nvidia might do a bit better on a selection of less popular games but we already gave it the performance category so we're calling this a tie.

Power Consumption / Efficiency: GTX 1650 Super vs RX 6500 XT

(Image credit: Shutterstock)

The GTX 1650 Super and RX 6500 XT aren't particularly demanding cards with official TBP (typical board power) ratings of 100W and 107W respectively. As you can guess real-world testing might show some minor differences but any decent power supply should prove sufficient for these GPUs.



Some models might have a larger factory overclock and require an 8-pin connector and all cards will need at least a 6-pin connector. That's enough for the card to use up to 150W (75W from the 6-pin and 75W from the PCIe slot) and even the largest factory overclocks are unlikely to push things that far.



AMD's previous generation GPUs often used far more power than their Nvidia counterparts but that's not the case with the current lineup. In our testingthe RX 6500 XT used 90W of power in our Metro Exodus test and 113W in FurMark while the GTX 1650 Super used 101W in Metro and 102W in FurMark. There's a good chance other games would have the RX 6500 XT using more power which means overall it's a tie.



That's certainly an interesting outcome considering Nvidia's GTX 1650 Super uses TSMC's older 12nm FFN node while the AMD RX 6500 XT uses the newer 7nm node. AMD's Navi 24 also has a 107mm^2 die size compared to Nvidia's TU116 with a 284mm^2 chip size (though a decent chunk of the TU116 chip is disabled on this card). But lower clock speeds and other architectural differences come into play and ultimately power draw ends up being very similar.



Winner: Tie



A difference of 5–10W in real-world use cases basically doesn't matter when both cards have the same PSU connectivity requirements. 100W of power give or take means your graphics card shouldn't need a massive cooler with lots of fans and the fans should spin at relatively low speeds leading to a quiet PC overall.

Windows used to have the constitution of 1-ply toilet paper.

""You just installed a new program: better restart!"" Windows used to say. And this was not an isolated experience. ""Oh you're letting Windows Update install while it's still light outside? Better restart before during and after!"" ""Nice new mouse firmware you've got there. Better restart your whole operating system in case this somehow affects I don't know everything?"" ""Did you just breathe really hard? Yeah better res—""

That was the Windows we lived with for years. I got used to aggressively telling Windows no I didn't want to restart for every minor new program install and mostly I got away with it. It turned out Windows would for the most part keep ticking along just fine despite its warnings. But there were some things that always seemed like they'd require a full reboot. Installing new graphics card drivers was one of them.

What a pain that process used to be. You'd go to Nvidia's or AMD's website to find the latest drivers. It'd helpfully tell you it could auto-identify your card for you… but it only worked if you used Internet Explorer. Grumbling you'd find the right jumble of numbers from a dropdown menu that represented your graphics card. Download the file. Install it. Restart. Pre-SSDs this would take a couple minutes. And when you got back to Windows your resolution would probably be set to a fuzzy 800x600.

Graphics driver installs got smoother over the years but surely changing something as fundamental as the bridge between your computer hardware and how every pixel is drawn on your screen would require restarting Windows. Then Nvidia came out with GeForce Experience eliminating that obnoxious ""hunt for the right driver"" step… and also making it so that you could just keep carrying on Windows while the fresh new driver installed. No more reboots.

It's been years now and it still feels like I'm doing the impossible every time. I once asked Nvidia how their programmers pulled this off when Windows still wanted to restart for so many seemingly smaller updates. Nvidia's answer was basically: a buttload of work.

Butts well spent.

Micron's 24 Gbps GDDR6X Memory Enter Mass Production Coming To NVIDIA's Next-Gen GPUs Later This Year

Micron announced earlier this year that they were readying their brand new 24 Gbps GDDR6X memory modules for future graphics cards. The announcement came at a time when NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3090 Ti had just entered the market for which Micron had produced 16 Gb DRAM modules rated at up to 21 Gbps speeds.

Now Micron is going to offer even faster pin speeds of 24 Gbps in a 16 Gb density which means that once again we will be looking at 2 GB VRAM capacities and up to 24 GB capacities across a 384-bit bus interface. Just like the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti which featured all of its memory modules on the front of the PCB the next-gen GeForce RTX 4090 would feature its 12 GDDR6X modules on the front allowing for more cooling compared to solutions that feature memory modules on the back of the PCB such as the RTX 3090 (Non-Ti).

Although the full 24 Gbps speeds aren't expected to be utilized by the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 (rumored to offer up to 21 Gbps die speeds) the 24 Gbps GDDR6X memory modules can offer up to 1.152 TB/s of bandwidth which is an increase of 14% versus the 1.008 TB/s offered on current 21 Gbps GDDR6 memory modules.

Micron has commenced mass production of its 24 Gbps GDDR6X memory modules for NVIDIA Next-Gen GPUs. (Image Credits: Harukaze5719)

Following are the bandwidth numbers you can expect with a 24 Gbps DRAM solution:

512-bit solution - 1.5 TB/s

1.5 TB/s 384-bit solution - 1.1 TB/s

1.1 TB/s 320-bit solution - 960 GB/s

960 GB/s 256-bit solution - 768 GB/s

768 GB/s 192-bit solution - 576 GB/s

576 GB/s 128-bit solution - 384 GB/s

384 GB/s 92-bit solution - 276 GB/s

276 GB/s 64-bit solution - 192 GB/s

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 is going to be amongst the first next-gen graphics card to utilize the latest GDDR6X memory modules when it launches later this year. Given that these chips are likely going to be downclocked to hit the power targets there will be a huge overclocking potential for enthusiasts to take advantage of.

AMD on the other hand is likely to depend on its partner Samsung for its next-gen RDNA 3 lineup. Samsung is also working on a 24 Gbps GDDR6 memory module which is expected to hit mass production soon.

Yes an eagled-eyed denizen of Twitter spotted that there’s a clear thousand bucks off the FTW3 Gaming model which has a recommended price of $2150 and is now $1150 at the card maker’s online store so it’s now pretty close to half-price.

Holy Crap but Jay said to buy now? pic.twitter.com/G96qqouSqHAugust 6 2022

The FTW3 Ultra Gaming model isn’t much more expensive at $1200 coming with a slightly higher boost speed (so it’s certainly another option should the base FTW3 graphics card sell out of stock).

Note that the official MSRP for the RTX 3090 Ti is $2000 (£1879 AU$2499) but EVGA put a slight premium on its FTW3 versions due to beefed up cooling systems that allow the GPU to run a bit faster.

Analysis: To buy or to wait?

To put this price into perspective with the rest of the range EVGA’s RTX 3080 Ti is running at $1100 right now so you can get the 3090 Ti for only fifty bucks more making it a total no-brainer for those who want a top-end Ampere graphics card from EVGA at the moment (assuming their PC case thermals and PSU can cope with the 3090 Ti of course).

As you may recall recently Nvidia officially reduced the RTX 3090 Ti to $1500 (along with price cuts to other top dog Ampere graphics cards) but the flagship GPU appears to be quickly tumbling from even that reduced level. At Newegg you can pick up a Zotac 3090 Ti for $1240 now for example but EVGA’s price undercuts that by almost a further hundred dollars.

Something we’ve been hearing on the grapevine consistently in recent times is that Nvidia’s partners have excess stock of RTX 3000 cards to clear and this would seem to be a pretty clear indication that this may indeed be the case.

It’s certainly a big price reduction by EVGA and if next-gen Lovelace GPUs are coming close to launch now the first one out the door will purportedly be the RTX 4090 – so it makes sense that the biggest discounts should be applied to the top end RTX 3090 and 3090 Ti first as these will rapidly become less tempting propositions as the Lovelace release timeframe nears.

What could happen now is that more graphics card manufacturers lower their 3090 Ti prices (and maybe other high-end Nvidia models) and we could see a race to sell them off – potentially. That said if we’re looking at almost half-price already there has to be a limit to how low things will go and at its current price the EVGA RTX 3090 Ti looks none too shabby to say the least.

On the other hand when Lovelace arrives rumor has it that the RTX 4070 could be the equal of the 3090 Ti (or maybe even a touch faster) – but then it’s expected to be the most popular model of the higher-end Lovelace offerings so buying it at MSRP could prove challenging (or even buying it at all perhaps initially). Especially if the 4070 offers as much of a jaw-dropping price to performance value proposition as speculation seems to suggest.

And with the RTX 4070 potentially not arriving this year as another rumor contends grabbing the RTX 3090 Ti when it gets even cheaper may not be such a bad move after all – at least for those who don’t have the patience to see how the Lovelace rollout and stock situation pans out. We’d still advise waiting ourselves but then again we’d understand those who want to make the leap now…

Tyler was 30 years old a graduate of Dartmouth High School and Bridgewater State University when he took his own life in 2018.

His uncle Joel Baptista said Tyler's smile could light up a room but it was amazing how much that smile could hide.

""We saw some signs and help was provided but sometimes the pain is just too much and people can't see the light at the end of the tunnel"" Baptista said. ""We have a close-knit family but we just didn't know it would come to that.""

Jenelle Hickey is the coordinator of a program at Child and Family Services that assists young people at risk of suicide giving them the help they need to hopefully move forward.

Both Baptista and Hickey joined Townsquare Sunday this week to discuss suicide in our area.

After Tyler's death Baptista said his family decided to form a foundation to assist organizations working with young people on suicide prevention. That organization is Child and Family Services and Janelle Hickey's CBAT unit.

""We work with kids (ages) four to 17 who are in an acute mental health crisis"" Hickey said. ""That might mean depression anxiety or having suicidal thoughts and feelings.""

She said youngsters in the program stay about two weeks while personnel work on getting them to feel better.

CBAT currently has nine beds but it will grow to 15 when the program moves to the former Regal House building on Church Street sometime after the New Year. Hickey said her program is always full and sadly it's not uncommon for people at risk to have to wait for placement.

The Tyler Joseph Leonard Memorial Foundation will hold a fundraiser on September 10 from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. at the Allendale Country Club in Dartmouth. It will feature music dancing a silent auction and much more.

Proceeds from the event will fund a scholarship for a Dartmouth High School student and the CBAT program at Child and Family Services. For information and tickets visit thetylerjosephleonardmemorialfoundation.org.

Robert Ricciardi 87 and Gemma Ricciardi 85 are presumed dead after the inferno that consumed their mansion on Normandy Heights Road. Morris County Prosecutor Robert Carroll said the couple could not be found once fire crews brought the blaze under control.

Morris Township police and fire were alerted to the fire shortly before 3 a.m. early Friday morning. Carroll said that the intensity of the flames prevented several attempts by firefighters to enter and search for victims.

Helicopter video from CBS 2 New York showed the scope of the devastation. Almost the entire roof collapsed into the home.

Morris County Assistant Prosecutor Thomas Schmid said two victims' remains were pulled from the wreckage on Saturday afternoon. The Morris County Medical Examiner’s Office is working to confirm their identities.

MorristownGreen.com reported that Robert Ricciardi was the co-founder of the Ricciardi Brothers paint store chain. The couple's godson Tommy Casanola spoke with the local outlet later Friday.

“I have no words to say except they were the two greatest people in the world and they don’t make people like that anymore” Casanola said. “They will be in my heart forever. Mr. and Mrs. Ricciardi were the nicest people in the world.""

Investigators are still working to find the cause of the fire.

OXY,Occidental Petroleum,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhcnRlbmVyZ3kuY29tL2V4Y2x1c2l2ZXMvb2NjaWRlbnRhbC1wZXRyb2xldW0tZXh0ZW5kcy1wZXJtaWFuLWJhc2luLWp2LXRocm91Z2gtMjAyNS0yMDE1MzLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Occidental Petroleum Extends Permian Basin JV through 2025,"Occidental Petroleum Corp. said this week it will extend its joint venture (JV) in the Permian Basin with Colombia’s Ecopetrol SA through the first quarter of 2025 with the Colombian company earning additional interest in the Delaware Basin.

Occidental President and CEO Vicki Hollub said on its second-quarter earnings call on Aug. 3 that the two companies would enhance their JV in the Midland and Delaware basins to encompass 20000 net acres. The Houston-based independent E&P company also reported a record $4.2 billion in free cash flow for the quarter

The Ecopetrol JV includes 17000 acres in the Texas Delaware that Hollub said would utilize Occidental’s infrastructure. In the Midland Basin “Oxy will benefit from the opportunity to continue development with an extension to the capital carry through the end of this agreement in the first quarter of 2025.”

The JV has worked “exceptionally well for both parties with Oxy benefiting from incremental production and cash flow from the Midland Basin with minimal investment” she said. “We are fortunate to collaborate with a partner who has extensive expertise and with whom we share a long-term vision.”

In the Delaware Basin Occidental has the option to bring forward the development of high-quality acreage that was planned further out in its development plans while benefiting from an additional capital carry of up to 75%. In exchange for the carried capital Ecopetrol will earn a percentage of the working interest in the JV asset.

The initial JV which was announced in July 2019 was valued at up to $1.5 billion. By September 2020 despite a severe downturn in commodity prices at the time Ecopetrol planned to drill a total of 100 Permian Basin wells by the end of 2021.

Overall Occidental’s earnings were viewed as positive by analysts who noted record free cash flow of $4.18 billion. Hollub said the company remains focused on reducing debt before increasing cash that to shareholders.

“At the beginning of this year we established a near-term goal of repaying an additional $5 billion of debt before further increasing the amount of cash allocated to shareholder returns” she said. “The debt we completed in May brought the total debt repaid this year to over $8 billion surpassing our target at a quicker pace than we had originally anticipated.”

Source: Occidental Petroleum Corp. Occidental Q2 Earnings Overview Free cash flow $4.2 billion Debt reduction $4.8 billion Adjusted EPS $3.16 Share repurchase plan $972 billion Capex $972 million

Year-to-date Occidental has repaid about $8.1 billion of its debt including $4.8 billion in the second quarter exceeding near-term goals of repaying $5 billion in principal this year.

John Freeman an analyst at Raymond James said that as of Aug. 1 Occidental had repurchased more than 18 million shares for about $1.18 billion. The company also paid down nearly $5 billion in debt bringing its net debt below $20 billion as it closes in on its target.

“Despite reiterating 2022 capital spend ($3.9-4.3 billion we’re leaning toward higher end) OXY upped Permian capex $200 million (to $1.9-2.1 billion) citing increased cost inflation (½ the driver) and higher 2H22 activity (other ½ but minimal effect on 2022 production)” Freeman wrote in an Aug. 3 report.

Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta said that Occidental’s cash flow missed its expectations but reported capex of $972 million for the second quarter which was below its estimate of $1.16 billion.

“Given the company has accomplished its near-term net debt targets the focus for the company is now on incremental capital returns consideration (~$1.1 billion of $3 billion in share repurchase program has been deployed YTD)” he said. “In the medium-term OXY plans to reduce its gross debt to the “high-teens” in order to achieve investment grade credit ratings.”

Ryan M. Todd a senior research analyst at Piper Sandler said in Aug. 2 commentary that Occidental’s oil and gas results were weaker than expected. Todd noted that reported adjusted earnings before taxes (EBT) were $4.89 billion versus Piper Sandler’s estimates of $5.05 billion.

Permian production (493000 boe/d) was at the midpoint of guidance range with fiscal-year 2022 lowered from 527000-537000 boe/d to 516000-526000 boe/d. However fiscal-year 2022 total production guidance remains unchanged aided by increased production guidance from the Gulf of Mexico Rockies and other areas.

“While FY22 production guidance of 1140-1170 kboe/d was unchanged vs. prior guidance the trajectory is likely to be more backend loaded than previously expected (stronger 2023 trajectory...) as 3Q22 production guidance of 1140-1170 kboe/d is below Street expectations (1182 kboe/d)” Todd wrote.

David Deckelbaum an analyst at Cowen said that overall Occidental is a “unique standout amongst E&P names in 2Q22 as capex was left unchanged.”

“We see OXY in an improved position as a strong commodity environment lifts cash flows and leverage comes down. We see OXY accumulating FCF as it pursues disciplined growth returns cash to shareholders and continues to de-lever” Deckelbaum said.

He noted that Occidental’s low carbon venture will also become increasingly important to the “OXY story” as time goes on.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vZmZzaG9yZS1tYWcuY29tL3JlZ2lvbmFsLXJlcG9ydHMvdXMtZ3VsZi1vZi1tZXhpY28vYXJ0aWNsZS8xNDI4MDkwOC9tdXJwaHktb2lsLXN0ZXBwaW5nLXVwLWl0cy1ndWxmLW9mLW1leGljby1wbGFuc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Murphy Oil stepping up its Gulf of Mexico plans,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vZmZzaG9yZS1tYWcuY29tL3JlZ2lvbmFsLXJlcG9ydHMvdXMtZ3VsZi1vZi1tZXhpY28vYXJ0aWNsZS8xNDI4MDkwOC9tdXJwaHktb2lsLXN0ZXBwaW5nLXVwLWl0cy1ndWxmLW9mLW1leGljby1wbGFuc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D84B27790>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vZmZzaG9yZS1tYWcuY29tL3JlZ2lvbmFsLXJlcG9ydHMvdXMtZ3VsZi1vZi1tZXhpY28vYXJ0aWNsZS8xNDI4MDkwOC9tdXJwaHktb2lsLXN0ZXBwaW5nLXVwLWl0cy1ndWxmLW9mLW1leGljby1wbGFuc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2NoYXJsZXMtY29mZmV5LW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM2MTYyODcz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Charles Coffey Obituary (2022) - Lakeway TX - Weed-Corley-Fish Funeral Home Lake Travis,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2NoYXJsZXMtY29mZmV5LW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM2MTYyODcz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D84B244C0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2NoYXJsZXMtY29mZmV5LW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM2MTYyODcz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2J1ZmZldHRzLWZpcm0tcmVwb3J0cy00NGItbG9zcy0xMzE1NDEwNTEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Buffett's firm reports $44B loss but its businesses thrive,"FILE - Warren Buffett chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway smiles as he plays bridge following the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting in Omaha Neb. on May 5 2019.

OMAHA Neb. (AP) — Warren Buffett’s company reported a $43.76 billion loss in the second quarter as the paper value of its investments plummeted but Berkshire Hathaway’s many operating companies generally performed well suggesting the overall economy is weathering the pressure from inflation and rising interest rates.

Berkshire said Saturday that a largely unrealized $53 billion decline in the value of its investments forced it to report a loss of nearly $44 billion or $29754 per Class A share. That is down from $28.1 billion or $18488 per Class A share a year ago.

The stock prices of three of Berkshire's biggest investments — Apple American Express and Bank of America — all fell significantly during the second quarter. But those stocks have all rebounded during the third quarter meaning Berkshire’s portfolio is already worth more than it was at the end of the quarter.

Buffett has long said he believes Berkshire’s operating earnings are a better measure of the company’s performance because they exclude investment gains and losses which can vary widely quarter to quarter. By that measure Berkshire’s earnings were up significantly to $9.28 billion or $6312.49 per Class A share from last year’s $6.69 billion or $4399.92 per Class A share.

The four analysts surveyed by FactSet expected Berkshire to report operating earnings per Class A share of $4741.64.

Besides investments Berkshire owns more than 90 companies outright. Berkshire said operating profits were up at all of its major units including its insurance companies major utilities and BNSF railroad. The strong results at most of its companies offset a $487 million pretax underwriting loss at Geico which reported bigger auto claims losses because of the soaring value of vehicles and ongoing shortages of car parts.

CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said Geico’s results suggest the auto insurer is having more trouble raising rates to offset those higher costs than its peers at Progressive and Allstate so “I definitely think that merits watching.”

Berkshire is often seen as a microcosm of the broader economy because its eclectic collection of manufacturing retail insurance utility and service businesses touches so many different industries and Berkshire’s profits tend to follow whatever the economy is doing. Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said Berkshire’s strong operating results suggest that many businesses have been able to raise prices enough to offset surging inflation and even though higher interest rates are hurting Berkshire’s network of car dealers and its manufactured home division other parts of the company are benefitting from higher rates on investments.

“This is a business that has its tentacles in all different parts of the economy. To show such broad revenue and earnings strength throughout the franchise it gives me a lot of confidence that the broader economy is performing pretty well” Shanahan said.

Berkshire said its revenue grew more than 10% to $76.2 billion in the quarter as many of its businesses increased prices.

Berkshire said it was sitting on $105.4 billion cash at the end of the quarter which was little changed from the $106 billion it reported at the end of the first quarter. That signaled Buffett wasn't buying nearly as many stocks during the second quarter although it has reported investing several billion in Occidental Petroleum. In the first three months of the year Berkshire spent more than $51 billion on stocks.

Berkshire did spend $1 billion buying back its own shares in the quarter but the pace of those buybacks has slowed significantly. Berkshire repurchased $3.2 billion of its shares in the first quarter and $27 billion last year. Before this year's buying spree of stocks such as oil producers Occidental and Chevron and printer maker HP Inc. repurchases had been Buffett's biggest investment in recent years as he struggled to find major acquisitions.

Berkshire's acquisition drought ended this year when he signed a $11.6 billion deal to acquire the insurance conglomerate Alleghany.

One interesting tidbit disclosed deep in Berkshire's Securities and Exchange Commission filing is that the company bought Berkshire Vice Chairman Greg Abel's stake in Berkshire's utility unit for $870 million in June. Abel is set to take over as Berkshire CEO once Buffett is unavailable although the legendary 91-year-old investor has no plans to retire. The filing offered no indication of what Abel would do with the money including whether he would reinvest it in Berkshire shares.

Some investors have called for Abel to increase his Berkshire investment before he takes over as CEO so he would have a bigger stake in the company's future. At last report Abel held five Class A shares and nearly 2400 Class B shares. Contrast that with Buffett who holds 229016 A shares and 276 B shares to give him control of more than 30% of Berkshire's voting stock.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL2JlcmtzaGlyZS1oYXRoYXdheS1wb3N0cy00My04LWJuLXEyLWxvc3MtYXMtc3RvY2staG9sZGluZ3MtdHVtYmxlLTEyMjA4MDcwMDYyNF8xLmh0bWzSAZEBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3Mtc3RhbmRhcmQuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlL2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvYmVya3NoaXJlLWhhdGhhd2F5LXBvc3RzLTQzLTgtYm4tcTItbG9zcy1hcy1zdG9jay1ob2xkaW5ncy10dW1ibGUtMTIyMDgwNzAwNjI0XzEuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Berkshire Hathaway posts $43.8-bn Q2 loss as stock holdings tumble,"The slide in U.S. stock prices punished Berkshire Hathaway Inc's bottom line in the second quarter as the conglomerate run by billionaire Warren Buffett on Saturday reported a $43.8 billion loss.



Berkshire nevertheless generated nearly $9.3 billion of operating profit as gains from reinsurance and the BNSF railroad offset fresh losses at the Geico car insurer where parts shortages and higher used vehicle prices boosted accident claims.



Rising interest rates and dividend payouts helped insurance businesses generate more money from investments while the strengthening U.S. dollar boosted profit from European and Japanese debt investments.

Ballard Stadium called The Deck that will include seats on the stadium's West Side an all-you-can-eat buffet soft drinks a cash bar and an area to mingle.



The Deck will have TVs showing the live football broadcast and also has clear views of the playing field. Premium seating of every kind has sold out every season and this is an effort by ODU to meet the demand.



And that's not on the only change coming to ODU football home games.



The general public will be allowed to purchase beer and wine for the first time this fall.



ODU has also fulfilled a promise made three years ago to install cup holders on the more than 5000 chair back seats.



All of the 482 chair back seats in the Cox Business Loge Lounge premium seat area in the south end zone have been replaced.



Fans will also notice new branding. It will be ODU's first season in the Sun Belt Conference and the stadium turf has new logos as well as new signage inside the stadium.



""The Deck"" will be located behind sections W118 and W119 on the second level of West Side behind the ODU bench.



Tickets are $1000 apiece and include a buffet free soft drinks and a cash bar. It also offers a clear view of the TowneBank replay scoreboard in addition to the playing field.



The Deck is being marketed largely to area corporations and businesses as a place for corporate leaders or their employees to mingle for both business and pleasure. But the club is open to everyone who wants a little more than just seats in the stadium.



For information on purchasing tickets to The Deck or general season tickets call Justin Ross at 757-683-3360.



Most FBS schools including Virginia Virginia Tech and James Madison already allow beer and wine sales in football and basketball venues. ODU was cautious in adopting a similar policy.



Athletic Director Dr. Wood Selig and other ODU administratorss authorized a ""pilot program"" of beer and wine sales at men's and women's basketball games last season.



Selig said that ODU wanted to see if beer and wine sales resulted in any behavioral problems among fans and said there were none.



Selig said ODU was prudent in being cautious but he's glad football fans can enjoy some beer or wine while watching the game.



""This is something our fans have been requesting for years"" he said adding: ""Fans are generally accustomed to having a beer when they watch a game.""



That has long been the case at the region's two other major sports venues Harbor Park home of the Norfolk Tides; and Scope where the Norfolk Admirals play.



Mixed drinks will not be sold at S.B. Ballard concession stands. You must be in a premium seating area -- the Priority Automotive Club the Deck luxury suites or the Cox Business Loge Lounge -- to purchase mixed drinks.



The cup holders were promised in 2019 when ODU was doing a $71 million makeover of old Foreman Field that transformed the venue into S.B. Ballard Stadium. Seating was increased to 21944.



Most of the stadium was demolished and rebuilt in a little less than 10 months and the cup holders were one of several upgrades that had to be delayed because of cost.



A year later ODU was in the midst of the pandemic and did not play football. Once football returned last season the University began planning to make good on its promise.



Branded Seats a San Diego company that specializes in installing cup holders into existing stadiums recently finished affixing cup holders on 5474 chair back seats.



Fan reaction was largely along the lines of ""better late than never.""



""It's been a big topic of discussion in our tailgate group"" said Ilana Davlin an alumnus and long-time season ticket holder.



""One member of our group would often say 'God gave us two cup holders' when we talked about it.



""It may seem like a small thing but it's a big deal to fans that we finally have them.""







Long-time fan Larry Eakin called the renovation of S.B. Ballard Stadium ""our shiny new BMW"" and the missing cup holders ""the hood ornament.""



""I never cared much about cup holders but I've heard a lot of fans who really wanted them. So I'm glad we have them.""



Jena Virga executive director of the Old Dominion Athletic Foundation the University's fundraising group said ODU always intended to install the cup holders.



""It's something that was important to our donors and fans"" she said. ""They've asked for the cup holders and we listened to them.""



Promotional cups are being planned as a giveaway to fans in chair back seats ""because they've shown so much patience"" Virga said.



Greg Smith ODU's associate athletic director for facilities and event management played a big role in selecting Branded Seats as a vendor and choosing the type of cup holders the University installed.



Ironically ODU had planned to install smallish cup holders in 2019 that would not fit all of the drink cups sold at S.B. Ballard Stadium.



The Branded Seats cup holders were 33 percent less expensive than standard cup holders but also bigger than what ODU had planned to purchase in 2019. The new holders will hold the largest drinks sold at S.B. Ballard Stadium the souvenir cups.



""We were able to save some money and provide a superior product"" Smith said.

Branded Seats came with great reviews said Smith. The group installed 65000 cup holders at the Pittsburgh Steelers home stadium now known as Acrisure Stadium.



As for the delay Smith said: ""We didn't want that to happen. But we never stopped planning to install the cup holders.



""I think the fans will really be happy with the result.""



ODAF promotional labels are on the front of each cup holder. ODAF hopes to recruit a sponsor for the labels next season.



Seating in the Cox Business Loge Lounge was installed in 2009 and were replaced because they had begun to show wear and tear.



The Cox Business Loge Lounge is one of the few premium seat options with availability. All 29 luxury suites and the 400 memberships in the Priority Automotive Club are sold out.



A few dozen loge seats remain at $5500 for four tickets. A membership comes with a coveted pass for the Red Garage which is adjacent to the stadium. Ticket holders have access to food and drinks within steps of their seats.

ODU opens at home on Friday Sept. 2 against Virginia Tech in one of the most anticipated Monarch home games in years. ODU upset Tech 49-35 in 2018 in the Hokies' first visit to Norfolk.



The game marks the debut of Tech head coach Brent Pry who was defensive coordinator at Penn State while ODU head coach Ricky Rahne was the offensive coordinator. The 7 p.m. game is expected to sell out before single-season tickets go on sale.



Of the 36 sections on the East and West sides 14 are sold out 19 have limited availability and three have medium availability. About 4000 tickets remain and sales were brisk this past week.



Last season the Monarchs lost six of their first seven games but then won the last five to earn their first bowl bid since 2016. Ten starters return on offense and seven on defense.

Look at them boots. And cowboy hats. And empty beer cans and cups.

Minnesota has gone country. In a big way.

Officially 39030 people — about 500 over capacity — attended middle-tier country star Cole Swindell's post-Twins game concert Thursday at Target Field. More than 27000 partied this weekend with superstar Luke Bryan and others at the three-day 39th We Fest in Detroit Lakes. And Kenny Chesney the king of country stadium concerts drew 50150 revelers on Saturday to U.S. Bank Stadium.

He's earned that crown if only for his last decade in the Twin Cities. This was Chesney's sixth appearance since 2012 at a Minneapolis stadium — Target Field four times and now the Vikings palace twice.

In his first local gig since 2018 Chesney hit the stage in overdrive. He usually starts in fourth gear but this time the opening ""Beer in Mexico"" was supercharged fueled by hard-driving new drummer Nick Buda and additional guitarist Danny Rader who toured with Keith Urban for years.

Chesney has never sounded so loud amped and explosive. The guitars were cranked to 11 all night. And so was the star whose Minneapolis concert was postponed twice (because of the pandemic) since going on sale in October 2019. This was his most spirited and crowd-satisfying performance in a Twin Cities coliseum even if it was overloud.

Chesney seldom downshifted even for the slower numbers. ""Summertime"" is usually a breezy stroll but on Saturday it felt like a Corvette convertible cruising at 75 mph. ""I Go Back"" typically a midtempo reflection on younger days found Chesney so hyper that he was doing jumping jacks. ""Get Along"" a gentle simple-minded tune about well getting along with one another despite differences was transformed into a rowdy sing-along drinking song.

Even his classic country ballad ""Anything But Mine"" was blasted so loud that its bittersweetness was obliterated though Chesney's relatively quiet final line was one of his finest vocals.

Chesney did dial it down finally an hour into his 110-minute set for ""Save It for a Rainy Day"" when he was joined by two members of opening act Old Dominion who wrote the song. The island-flavored ""When the Sun Goes Down"" was pretty chill too assuring the No Shoes Nation that this superstar is not just a beach boy because ""everything gets hotter when the sun goes down.""

Whether it's day or night in a ballpark or on a gridiron Chesney touches all the bases — beer beaches romance and sentimentality.

More than any other act the tanned and toned Tennessean has made beaches part of the Nashville landscape and he proved it Saturday on his twin theme songs played back-to-back ""No Shoes No Shirt No Problems"" and ""We Do"" from his 19th and most recent studio album 2020's ""Here and Now.""

Chesney 54 is also big on sentimentality reflecting on old times Saturday in the ebullient jumping jack-punctuated ""Young"" the aforementioned ""I Go Back"" and ""The Boys of Fall"" his 2010 nostalgic ode to high school football that he dedicated to the Minnesota Vikings for letting him work out at their TCO Performance Center on Saturday morning.

Lacking the searing intensity of Eric Church (who in June drew a stunning 51117 to U.S. Bank Stadium) and the hammy showmanship of Garth Brooks (who attracted 70000 to USBS in 2019) Chesney was more like a hyperkinetic sweaty rock star in cowboy clothes. In other words a stadium full of fun.

In some of his previous Minneapolis stadium appearances Chesney had some pretty high-profile partners open for him including Tim McGraw Zac Brown Band Thomas Rhett and Jason Aldean. This time he chose three hitmakers with a little less muscle for a massive venue.

The acoustics of the Vikings dome didn't flatter honey-voiced Carly Pearce who deservedly was recently named CMA and ACM female vocalist of the year. With their hourlong set Old Dominion Twin Cities favorites for several years gave probably their strongest local performance with their energy and enthusiasm measuring up to the catchiness of their songs which are part pop part hip-hop part beach (thanks Kenny) and all hooks.

Dan + Shay who crushed it at Target Center last fall are big on pretty pop ballads (think yacht rock marketed as country music) which play fine on country radio but not necessarily with a beer-fueled here-for-the-party stadium crowd.

Morgantown native Luke Darnell shows off his BBQ talents in an hour-long episode to renowned award-winning chef Michael Symon on the Food Network show BBQ USA at the New Jersey KnoQ-Out competition in Blairstown premiering at 9 p.m. Aug. 8. BBQ USA is based on Michael Symon going to different BBQ competitions around the country and following teams that are competing.

“I couldn’t be more excited about being on this show” Darnell said. “To have someone of that caliber like Michael Symon try your food was nerve-wracking but was a great experience. This new TV series will show that there’s nothing better than being out on the circuit and hanging with the people we love while striving to get better every single week at cooking up mouth-watering chicken ribs pork and brisket.”

Darnell and his wife Kim are no strangers to the BBQ competition world. With their competition team Old Virginia Smoke they were crowned the 2016 World BBQ Champion at the World Food Championships in 2017 was the Chicken Team of the Year for the Kansas City BBQ Society. They also won the chicken category at the 2021 American Royal — the biggest BBQ competition in the world.

“BBQ is different because it seems like an easy thing to put in a cooker for 8-10 hours but there’s a process to make sure it’s not dry” Darnell said. “It’s like with any type of cooking it takes care and love in the heart and everything will turn out great.”

Growing up in Morgantown Darnell found a passion for BBQ when he was a child through family get-togethers where his dad would cook whole hogs in the ground. That would involve building a fire putting a wire rack over the fire then the hog cardboard on top and finally burying the pig in the dirt to keep the heat in.

Darnell made sure that if any smoke rose from the ground to cover the hog with dirt. Thinking it was the most-important job he took it very seriously but looking back he realized it was busywork so the adults could relax and drink some beer. From then on Darnell discovered he loved outdoor cooking.

“Food is important for bringing people together because that’s what it’s always been. Growing up and being surrounded by great cooking every Saturday; cooking with family playing football and having that shared experience is something I carry forward.”

Darnell’s father Warren Darnell said when Luke was in college the family would prepare a whole week in advance for WVU gameday weekends including cooking a whole turkey in the Blue Lot parking lot.

“We watched all these different shows on the Food Network for many many years and always a lot of these barbeque contests” Warren Darnell said. “Lucas always said ‘One of these days I’ll be there.’ I’m very proud of him. He’s got something he really enjoys and it’s what makes him happy.”

Darnell met his wife at a Virginia Tech vs. West Virginia University game. At the time Darnell attended WVU majoring in English with a minor in political science — with no plans to make his cooking hobby a life career. He said he is blessed to have Kim as a partner for the summer BBQ competitions due to her organizational and attention-to-detail skills along with her strong streak of competitiveness.

“The one thing that drives her the most [for competition BBQ] is that she is extremely competitive” Darnell said. “She played college softball and was in gymnastics. On our third date we went to the ESPN Zone and played a game of air hockey — I’ll be completely transparent that I’m not the best winner — but I beat her at air hockey and she stormed off and didn’t talk to me for half an hour.”

Even chef Michael Symon was amazed at Kim’s attention to detail during the show production Darnell said.

Throughout the school year Kim is a guidance counselor. Old Virginia Smoke is Darnell’s passion but the competitions provide an opportunity for them to spend time together.

Darnell said barbecue is not just BBQ — rather it’s an art form of putting himself and his story on a plate and that is firmly rooted in family and a way to pay homage to where he’s from. Combining both West Virginia and his current residence in Virginia Darnell created Old Virginia Smoke in 2012 to highlight dishes and ingredients from Appalachia by putting twists on familiar dishes like cabbage rolls freeze-dried ranch and pepperoni rolls in competitions.

Old Virginia Smoke participates in the chicken ribs brisket and pork categories at competitions with brisket being Darnell’s favorite item to cook due to it being the most difficult to cook consistently.

Darnell shows off his mouthwatering ribs.

“My favorite aspect about barbecuing is knowing you put so much time into something and when it comes out perfect you can take a lot of pride in that” Darnell said. “I still tear up every time I put the knife to a competition brisket and it’s perfect. Every contest. We cook 230 of them now — every time I have to take a moment and be emotional about what I just did knowing that I did it right.”

With 13 Grand Championships and 20 Reserve Grand Championships over the past 10 years Darnell made his passion for barbecuing into a successful full-time job. Old Virginia Smoke has its own food truck catering and sauce business.

Through his feature on Food Network Darnell is honored not only to represent West Virginia but also to honor his mother who died a couple of years ago.

“I can’t help but think she’s up there pulling strings to make all this happen and I wish she was here for this” Darnell said. “This was something that — us competing and doing competition BBQ — is something she truly loved that I was doing something with cooking. To have it come this far is something that she would be proud of and something I shared with her.”

As for what the future holds for Darnell and Old Virginia Smoke he added “I’m going to keep on going and I don’t think there’s a limit to this because that’s what Mom would want me to do.”

Dylan Wood hit a two-run double and pitched 5 1/3 shutout innings for Fleet Park which will play for the overall championship at 4 p.m. Saturday on ESPN against the International champion Caribbean representative Radamés López Little League of Guayama Puerto Rico. Both finalists are 4-0 so far in the tournament in Easley South Carolina.

Wood’s blast to the base of the left-field fence with the bases loaded in the bottom of the second inning gave the Southeast Region champs a 2-0 lead. The 15-year-old from Greenbrier Christian Academy preserved the lead by pitching 5 1/3 shutout innings yielding five hits and a walk. He struck out six.

Smith replaced him and yielded a run in the sixth on a sacrifice fly on which center fielder John Stilwell made a diving catch.

In the final inning the seventh Lawson Behan’s bloop single to center and Luke Edgecomb’s infield hit — which was originally ruled an out until replay review prompted a correct reversal — put the potential go-ahead runs on base for the Houston team. Smith induced Jack Magnus to fly out to right field but a wild pitch moved the runners to second and third.

Cleanup batter Billy Theroux who struck out 11 as Texas’ starting pitcher then hit a weak ground ball to second for the second out as the runners stayed put. After Smith threw ball 1 to Bryce Bloom-Timmins Fleet Park intentionally walked him loading the bases.

With Mason Chiu at the plate a pitch got by catcher Derek Baker. Behan tried to race home from third base but Baker retrieved the ball and threw to Smith who was covering the plate.

Behan tried to jump past Baker and dove but missed the plate. Smith tagged him a few feet behind the plate to end the game setting off a celebration by the Norfolk team and its fans.

Fleet Park which won the state title and multi-state Southeast Regional to earn its ticket to Easley is 4-0 in the World Series entering the one-game championship contest.

Both of the Texas team’s losses were to Fleet Park which beat the Houston squad 6-1 earlier in the bracket.

The Puerto Ricans have outscored their opposition by a combined 42-8 in Easley. Fleet Park has outscored its foes 30-7."

Now It's Racing to Catch Up. (Published 2022),"TOKYO — It was the spring of 2021 and demand for new cars was spiking. But as consumers flush with savings amassed during the pandemic rushed to dealerships around the world one Japanese automaker after another idled production as they waited for imports of a critical component: semiconductors.

Coronavirus outbreaks had shut down chip plants and an unanticipated surge in demand for electronics from people riding out the pandemic at home had constrained supplies. Nissan alone predicted a cut in output of half a million vehicles.

The chip shortfall — a blow to “the head” of Japan’s economy in the words of Yoshihiro Seki a lawmaker who leads a study group on semiconductors — woke up the country to the fragility of the supply chains that undergird its most important industries.

That has driven a broad reconsideration of how Japan can protect its economy the world’s third largest against both unforeseen economic shocks like the pandemic and looming risks like the rising tensions between the United States and China. Those risks were highlighted this week as the House speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan prompting an angry response from China.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXdzbGV0dGVycy8yMDIyLTA4LTA2L3NlbWljb25kdWN0b3Itc2hvcnRhZ2Utc2VlbXMtdG8tYmUtZWFzaW5nLW5ldy1lY29ub215LXNhdHVyZGF50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Semiconductor Shortage Seems to Be Easing: New Economy Saturday,"Why did this happen?

The report also said layoffs in Canada India and parts of Europe were expected in the coming weeks and months.

According to the Wall Street Journal the job cuts principally hit staff at Oracle’s advertising and customer experience group the people said. The group sells services to help clients analyze data about their customers and target advertising to those customers.

Oracle’s job cuts come as the company is putting increased emphasis on cloud healthcare services after recently receiving regulatory approval for its $28.3 billion deal for electronic-medical-records company Cerner Corp. They are hitting a unit that has become less central to the company at a time the digital ad market also is in turmoil.

The company had about 143000 full-time employees as of May 31 according to its latest annual report.

Menawhile Bloomberg reported that some workers were told that their positions had been eliminated according to four people with direct knowledge of the matter. Junior sales employees as well as a division sales director were among those let go according to one former worker who lost their job and asked not to be named to avoid professional repercussions. Rumors of pending cuts had swirled through the division in recent weeks but management said the positions were safe one former employee said.

The customer experience division provides analytics and advertising services. It has long lagged behind the growth of the rest of the Austin Texas-based software company. During an event last year Executive Vice President Douglas Kehring said the unit had “historically been probably a little more disappointing than it should have been.""

The company “decided to reorganize"" the customer experience group “and move on"" a former senior manager of sales engineering whose position was cut wrote on LinkedIn. In a separate post another fired manager cited the restructuring for the job reductions. Some marketing positions were also cut according to LinkedIn posts by a former senior manager and group vice president.

Instead these negotiators portray themselves as simply company representatives said Drew Schmitt a professional ransomware negotiator and principal threat analyst at cybersecurity firm GuidePoint Security.

""The biggest reason is because most ransomware groups specifically and explicitly say: 'We don't want to work with a negotiator. If you do bring a negotiator to the table we're just going to post your stuff anyway'"" Schmitt told The Register. Hence the need to masquerade as a regular employee.

Ransomware is of course malware that once on a network scrambles all the valuable files it can find and demands a payment to decrypt and restore the information. Lately gangs also steal copies of the data prior to encrypting it so that they can leak or sell it if the demand isn't paid. Sometimes they just siphon the files and don't bother to encrypt them. Sometimes the crooks use the purloined files to harass or exploit a victim's customers or users. There's all manner of things extortionists can do and demand once they are on your computers and have your data.

Schmitt said he negotiates one or two ransoms a month and victim organizations range from very small businesses to major enterprises spanning all industries. Manufacturing technology construction government and healthcare were the hardest hit in the second quarter of this year according to research done for his company's latest extortionware report.

I've also seen initial demands of $25 million ... they are all over the place

He said he once saw a ransom demand from a ""less-sophisticated group"" who wanted just $2000. ""But I've also seen initial demands of $25 million"" he added. ""So they are all over the place.""

Schmitt said he has on two occasions negotiated ransoms down to zero dollars. ""Both in different kinds of healthcare that when we went to the table and said 'Hey we're a healthcare organization. We're responsible for saving lives' they basically said 'We're sorry. We're going to give you a free decryptor.'""

Of course these are the outliers and some groups such as Hive specifically target the healthcare industry on the assumption that because lives and highly sensitive personal data are at stake among other factors hospitals are more likely to pay up to make the whole mess go away.

In fact a report earlier this year from ​​Sophos stated that 66 percent of surveyed healthcare organizations were hit by ransomware in 2021 — up from 34 percent the year before representing a 94 percent increase.

As ransomware and pure extortion become solid sources of income for miscreants there's naturally been a rise in demand for things like cyber-insurance and ransomware negotiators who act as intermediaries between the ransomware gang and the victim. Sometimes you may want to put someone between you and the crims someone who can make the cryptocurrency payment happen or haggle down the demand or get the decryptor from the extortionists and so on.

According to research published in March by Palo Alto Networks' incident response team the average ransom demand in 2021 for attacks it was aware of was $2.2 million a 144 percent increase from the year prior. Meanwhile the average payment last year jumped to $541010 up 78 percent from 2020.

From email ransom notes to Tor leak sites

Schmitt started working in incident response (IR) and threat intelligence about six years ago and said he ""fell into"" ransomware negotiations in 2019.

""It was a natural progression of working in incident response"" he said. As ransomware infections became more prevalent Schmitt started moving up the IR ladder and playing various roles in the investigation and response process. ""And one of those ended up being a negotiation with a threat actor.""

Back in the day circa 2019 these negotiations happened via email. But since then ransomware gangs have matured and evolved business operations to include instant messaging with victims to figure out deals affiliates to help spread the malware and employees with non-technical remits as the larger above-ground world learned through the Conti leaks earlier this year.

These days most crime groups have their own websites through which they operate and some have PR and marketing departments as well as in-house help desks.

Rather than faff about with email ""now it's usually just a URL"" directing a victim to the extortionists' Tor-hidden website and communication between victim and crook happens in a chat box displayed within the Tor browser Schmitt said. This is the point at which Schmitt usually gets called in to help with the incident response and sometimes ransomware negotiations.

The negotiation process itself involves bringing all the key business units to the table: C-suite executives cybersecurity analysts lawyers HR and PR representatives.

""All the critical teams that are going to be involved in the administrative response in addition to the technical response"" Schmitt said. ""All of those players are going to be involved to determine what the negotiation strategy looks like.""

Should you negotiate with criminals?

The first question they need to answer however is whether to negotiate with the criminals at all.

US federal agencies say organizations should not pay ransom demands [PDF] and some private security firms even suggest this exposes businesses to subsequent ransomware attacks. Regardless it's not a simple question to answer and the decision to negotiate or not is two-pronged we're told.

How is this going to impact our brand if we're exposed on a ransomware leak site?

""One is looking at it from a purely technical perspective"" Schmitt said. This includes determining if the company has the capacity to restore from backups data scrambled by the ransomware decrypt the files with a free tool or otherwise bring the IT environment back online without paying a ransom.

""And then the other side is legally based"" he said. ""This is where you start answering questions about: how is this going to impact our brand if we're exposed on a ransomware leak site? How is this going to potentially impact compliance if we have certain types of data exposed on a ransomware leak site? What are the risks associated with this and what are our options?""

One thought that Schmitt said doesn't usually come up in the discussion — unless the criminal gang has been sanctioned by the US Treasury or a similar body in which case it's illegal to pay a ransom to them — is the ethics of paying a ransom that in turn finances additional illicit activities and potentially oppressive regimes that back or orchestrate ransomware campaigns.

""If I'm being totally honest there's just not a lot of discussion of kind of where the funds go after the fact"" he admitted.

LockBit remains the most prolific gang over the past two years Schmitt said adding that Conti also kept his fellow negotiators busy before that group disbanded to form other gangs.

And each of these crime orgs have their own quirks histories and methods which can be useful to know and exploit during the negotiation process.

""We keep detailed notes of all the interactions that we have from various threat groups and then we use that to our advantage — this technique might work better than that technique or this group is known to negotiate or you can't push that group very long before they'll get bored and move on"" Schmitt said. ""They all have traits that we use to make sure we're not pushing the wrong buttons and giving us the highest chance of success for lowering the ransom as much as possible.""

However the criminals have typically done their homework too. For example: researching a victim organization's cyber insurance policy.

""Fairly often we'll see this as a negotiation tactic"" Schmitt said. ""'We've found your insurance policy we know you have coverage in the amount of $10 million so this is where we start.'""

Paying the initial demand doesn't happen very often. There's always some bargaining and quibbling. Corporations also have to factor in recovery costs and other expenses related to the security breach when figuring out what kind of budget they have to tackle the problem he said.

Just like buying a car

""But this is where we start"" Schmitt commented referring to the initial demands. ""And really from there it is the traditional back and forth negotiation process that you would see in many other business applications — or trying to buy a car.""

If that is you're locked in a room with the car salesperson for days on end while they threaten to leak your private information on a website for all to see and when they may decide to raise the asking price if you take too long to reach a deal.

Schmitt admitted it's a high-anxiety job. ""The stakes are really high"" he said. ""With incident response in general and especially ransomware it's really high stress.

""For more of the clients you're working with it's the worst point in their career and it might be the worst point they're ever going to have and you're thrust into that situation of trying to help them get out of the worst time of their career."" ®",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L2N5YmVyc2VjdXJpdHkvdG9wLTEwLWlubm92YXRpdmUtY3liZXJzZWN1cml0eS1zdGFydHVwcy10by1sb29rLWZvci1pbi0yMDIy0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW5hbHl0aWNzaW5zaWdodC5uZXQvYW1wL3N0b3J5L2N5YmVyc2VjdXJpdHkvdG9wLTEwLWlubm92YXRpdmUtY3liZXJzZWN1cml0eS1zdGFydHVwcy10by1sb29rLWZvci1pbi0yMDIy?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 10 Innovative Cybersecurity Startups to Look for in 2022,In a digitally hyperconnected world our increasing reliance on the internet means lots of potential new problems- chief among them malicious cyber attacks that can lock us out of our computers hold ransom our most sensitive files or even siphon our bank accounts.

Scully was the Dodgers’ play-by-play voice from 1950 until his retirement in 2016.

And ahead of Los Angeles’ game against the San Diego Padres the Dodgers held a ceremony in front of a packed crowd at Dodger Stadium (it was a very hot ticket).

The ceremony featured a moment of silence for Scully.

For more than a century Wall Street has been a wealth-building machine for those who are patient. Over long periods high-quality companies and the indexes they're a part of tend to increase in value.

Something else that's commonplace on Wall Street is change. It's perfectly normal for innovation acquisitions competitive advantages and other factors to shake up the world's largest publicly traded companies on a fairly regular basis.

Just 18 years ago companies like General Electric AIG and Intel were among the 10 largest publicly traded companies by market cap. As of Aug. 4 Intel wasn't even in the top 50 any longer while GE and AIG had fallen out of the top 125 and top 250 respectively. Eight years from now in 2030 the stock market's 10 largest stocks could look vastly different than they do today.

While absolutely nothing is set in stone I predict that the following 10 stocks will have the largest market caps by 2030. Note that these 10 companies aren't listed in any particular order.

1. Berkshire Hathaway

The first stock conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.61%) (BRK.B 0.60%) should retain its spot in the top 10 even if billionaire CEO Warren Buffett isn't at the helm come 2030. After overseeing an average annual return on the company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of 20.1% since 1965 Buffett has clearly shown he's set his company up for long-term success.

One factor that makes Berkshire Hathaway such an incredible company is the mountain of passive income it collects every year. Over the next 12 months Buffett's company is expected to bring in well over $6 billion in dividend income with $4.25 billion coming from just a handful of companies. Because dividend stocks have a long history of outperforming nondividend payers holding these time-tested companies for years or decades provides an added boost.

2. Apple

Perhaps the least-surprising prediction is that the largest publicly traded company in the U.S. Apple (AAPL 1.00%) will remain in the top 10 largest stocks by market cap by 2030.

Aside from an easily recognized brand name and faithful customer base Apple's innovation is key to its success. Introducing a 5G-capable iPhone quickly pushed up its market share in the U.S. while CEO Tim Cook is busy leading a multiyear transition that emphasizes subscription services. Ultimately subscriptions should boost Apple's operating margins and lessen the sales volatility witnessed during product replacement cycles.

Apple has also repurchased $520 billion worth of its own common stock since the beginning of 2013. If this aggressive buyback program continues value investors are likely to continue plowing into Apple.

3. Visa

Payment processor Visa (V 0.49%) currently finds itself on the outside looking in (No. 11). By the turn of the decade I expect it to firmly find itself as one of the 10 largest companies by market cap.

Visa's opportunity for expansion is enormous. Most global transactions are still being conducted in cash which means it can expand organically into underbanked regions such as the Middle East Africa and Southeastern Asia or lean on acquisitions to grow (e.g. the Visa Europe buyout in 2016). Sustained double-digit annual growth should be the expectation throughout the decade.

What's more Visa strictly sticks to payment processing. Although the company would probably do just fine as a lender it would also expose Visa to potential loan delinquencies and losses during recessions. By avoiding lending Visa is able to bounce back from economic downturns faster than its peers and maintain a profit margin above 50%.

4. Alphabet

Another FAANG stock that has an exceptionally high likelihood of retaining its top-10 ranking by market cap come 2030 is Alphabet (GOOGL 0.34%) (GOOG 0.24%) the parent company of internet search engine Google and streaming platform YouTube.

Google has long been Alphabet's foundational operating segment. Over the past two years it's handled no less than 91% of global internet search share a big reason why Alphabet sports such incredible ad-pricing power. As traffic acquisition costs decline over time Google should continue to be a cash cow for the company.

But Alphabet's future is about its higher-growth initiatives like YouTube and Google Cloud. YouTube has grown into the second-most-visited social site in the world while Google Cloud has gobbled up 8% of global cloud infrastructure spending.

5. Salesforce

Cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software provider Salesforce (CRM -1.36%) could make one of the biggest leaps (currently No. 43) in terms of market cap by 2030. CRM software is what's used to help businesses enhance customer relationships and boost sales.

Global CRM software sales are expected to sustain double-digit growth through at least mid-decade which is great news for the industry's unquestioned leader. According to IDC Salesforce commanded a 23.8% share of CRM software spending in 2021 (over four times its next-closest competitor).

In addition to its commanding market share co-CEO and co-founder Marc Benioff has a penchant for making earnings-accretive acquisitions. These deals broaden the Salesforce ecosystem and help with the company's cross-selling opportunities.

6. Amazon

E-commerce stock Amazon (AMZN 0.80%) is another really strong bet to retain its spot in among the 10 largest stocks by the turn of the decade.

Most folks know Amazon for its industry-leading online marketplace. In 2022 eMarketer projects that Amazon will account for 39.5% of all U.S. online retail sales. But the real crown jewel is the more than 200 million Prime members who've signed up as a result of its leading marketplace. The fees collected from Prime members help Amazon expand its logistics network and reinvest in high-growth initiatives.

There's also Amazon Web Services (AWS) which is the global No. 1 in cloud infrastructure spending with 33% market share. Corporate cloud spending is still in its early innings which means Amazon's operating cash flow could skyrocket in the years ahead.

7. PayPal Holdings

The company I predict will make the biggest leap into the top 10 stocks by market cap is fintech giant PayPal Holdings (PYPL 1.00%). PayPal is currently No. 88 with a $112 billion market cap.

Digital payments are still in their infancy which bodes well for fee-based payment platforms. Even with U.S. gross domestic product declining in back-to-back quarters PayPal's total payment volume on its network continues to grow by a double-digit percentage on a constant-currency basis.

Arguably even more important active users are more engaged than ever. At the end of 2020 active users were completing 40.9 transactions over the trailing 12 months (ttm). This figure is up to 48.7 transactions per active account on a ttm basis through June 2022 and it continues to climb.

8. Microsoft

Software kingpin Microsoft (MSFT 0.43%) the only company from the 10 largest stocks by market cap in 1999 to still have a top-10 position today has a good shot at sustaining its dominance throughout the decade.

Microsoft's success is a function of raking in mammoth amounts of cash flow from its legacy operations and funneling this cash into faster-growing projects. For instance even though its high-margin Windows franchise is generally a slow grower it still accounts for a 76% share of global desktop operating systems.

Microsoft is utilizing this cash flow to reinvest in a variety of cloud initiatives -- Azure is the global No. 2 in cloud infrastructure spending and grew sales by 46% on a constant-currency basis in the June-ended quarter -- and fuel acquisitions. For instance Microsoft offered $68.7 billion to acquire gaming company Activision Blizzard in January.

9. Chevron

Despite a feverish renewable energy push by most developed countries I predict oil and gas major Chevron (CVX 1.79%) will find its way into 10 largest publicly traded companies by market cap in 2030.

The biggest reason for this push is the expectation that oil and natural gas prices will remain elevated for many years to come. The pandemic resulted in multiple years of reduced domestic and international drilling and pipeline investment. Couple this with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and you'll see there's a clear risk to global energy supply.

Chevron is also in excellent financial shape compared to most other integrated oil stocks. By prudently deploying its capital and minimizing debt Chevron has been able to maintain its superior dividend repurchase its own stock and fund key natural gas projects in the Asia-Pacific region.

10. Meta Platforms

Lastly social media stock Meta Platforms (META 0.60%) the company formerly known as Facebook should find itself as one of the 10 largest stocks in 2030. You'll note that current top-10 stocks Tesla (TSLA -1.57%) UnitedHealth Group (UNH 0.76%) Nvidia (NVDA -1.84%) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 0.60%) didn't make the cut.

Although social media usage statistics can be extremely fickle to project one year in advance let alone in eight years Meta has four of the most downloaded apps in the world. On a combined basis Facebook Instagram WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger attracted 3.65 billion monthly active users in the June-ended quarter. That's over half the global adult population and a big reason why Facebook's ad-pricing power is exceptionally strong more often than not.

The wild card is the company's metaverse ambitions the ""metaverse"" being the next iteration of the internet that allows connected users to interact with each other and their surroundings in a 3D virtual environment. It will be years before the necessary infrastructure is in place to support the metaverse.

A multibillion-dollar aerospace and technology company with a Tulsa facility plans to finalize the building and configuration of at least six specialized aircraft for the military here beginning this fall.

With an initial government grant of $170 million L3Harris will equip and make flight-ready at least six AT-802U Sky Warden planes in Tulsa.

The manned single-engine turboprop aircraft is designed for airborne intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance as well as missions in extreme combat environments.

It is designed to perform in austere disaggregated combat environments with limited infrastructure. It has unparalleled range and endurance weapons sensor and communication capabilities the company said.

The contract for now has a cost ceiling of $3 billion.

“I was ecstatic” Luke Savoie president of intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance for L3Harris told the Tulsa World last week when asked about news of the grant. “This is very personal to me.”

Savoie is a former Air Force pilot of the AC-130 gunship and other aircraft and had a large role in designing and developing the Sky Warden platform.

Many of the Sky Warden’s features are proprietary and its capabilities — depending on its individual specifications for the military — are not available publicly Savoie acknowledged.

However he said depending on the aircraft’s sensors a pilot would be able to pinpoint a specific point where an enemy is firing.

“I can look out the window and I can see someone shooting. And I can sit there on the throttle and hit a button and drop a point of where I was looking at. I saw someone shooting a weapon — I drop a point right there” he said.

“And I can go over here and hit another button and the auto-pilot — based on what I was just looking at — will now automatically put the aircraft into orbit around that point.

“I hit another button ... and now the fire control is targeting that position. So I have a sensor looking at it the fire control has updated that — that’s what it should be targeting — and now I can just roll in and put a shot off and engage that and never have had to sit there in tight coordinates or do all these weird mouse clicks and all this other stuff (at a distance with drone military aircraft)” Savoie said.

“It’s fairly tightly integrated and digitally controlled. And that’s the greatest thing about the weapons system is how tightly that all works.”

He declined to say the cost range for each aircraft depending on its specific weapons and sensor configuration but a news release by the company said the Sky Warden is “affordable.”

The plane’s intended use is for close combat support by the Air Force Savoie said but could also potentially be sold to U.S. allies.

“Sky Warden has a demand out there. If you’re a nation state that deals with violent extremists — if you’re either budget constrained or you’re infrastructure constrained or you need things to be multi-role ... this provides options for those potential types of customers” he said.

“I’m honored to be part of this program and provide this capability to customers. We look forward to growing ... and expanding our presence in the state and look forward to supporting the state of Oklahoma” he said.

U.S. Special Operations Command selected L3Harris and Air Tractor Inc.’s Sky Warden system for its Armed Overwatch program.

With an initial program contract award of $170 million the program could include delivery of up to 75 aircraft.

Production of new fully modified Armed Overwatch mission-configured aircraft will begin in 2023 at L3Harris’ Tulsa modification center the company said in a news release following initial production at the Air Tractor Inc.’s Olney Texas aircraft manufacturing facility.

Air Tractor is a manufacturer of aircraft for agricultural firefighting and utility applications. Olney is about 130 miles northwest of Dallas and 40 miles south of Wichita Falls.

In Tulsa since 1974 and at Tulsa International Airport since 2013 L3Harris develops maintains and operates airborne missile tracking systems in support of the Missile Defense Agency Airborne Sensor Program.

The Melbourne Florida-based company is a technology supplier for military government and commercial partners.

L3Harris employs 306 people in Tulsa and with the contract is looking to expand with about 100 new positions including engineers and mechanical and electrical installers Savoie said.

In November the company announced an expansion of operations in Tulsa with plans to create at least 80 new jobs.

“We’ve been a strong supporter of L3 in wanting to put them in a position to be successful by providing world-class facilities for them to do their work just like we do with so many other rapidly growing companies out there at the airport” Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum said at the time.

“This is really in my mind this is one of our greatest opportunities for growth as it relates to Tulsa’s economy. It’s the industrial cluster that we have right here at the airport” Bynum said.

People in the Tulsa area could see the planes flying from Texas to L3Harris’ facility at Tulsa International Airport as soon as this fall Savoie said.

“The Sky Warden design reflects our commitment to America’s national security and the AT-802U will be equipped with everything we’ve learned manufacturing aircraft over the past 46 years” Air Tractor President Jim Hirsch said in a statement.

“The L3Harris team is an excellent partner and our production and engineering staff are ready to immediately deliver this world-class product to our nation’s special forces” Hirsch said.

L3Harris has more than $17 billion in annual revenue and 47000 employees with customers in more than 100 countries according to its website.

“Sky Warden will bring powerful and affordable close air support precision strike armed ISR (intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance) and command and control capabilities directly to special operations forces in the battlefield” Sean Stackley president of integrated mission systems for L3Harris said in a statement.

The event was attended by 300 participants and had a detailed Q&A session towards the end. The session had expert speakers coming from Food Safety and Standard Authority of India (FSSAI) Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and Siegwerk joining together to provide clarity on the legal obligations for the FMCG sector and associated packaging suppliers.

The safety aspects of packaging inks are gaining attention worldwide due to the presence of several substances with potential toxicological profiles such as mineral oils toluene PFAs benzophenone and several others. Globally the discussion around the subject is leading to more awareness in the market which is subsequently pushing the regulators to further raise the bar on packaging safety. The regulations worldwide are getting stricter and harmonised pushing the supply chain partners to adhere to the new norms.

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has raised the bar on packaging safety in its recent food packaging regulations. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has revised the standard IS 15495. Siegwerk being the market leader in India for food grade inks made a sincere attempt to create awareness in the market with support from the Food Safety and Standard Authority of India as well as Bureau of Indian Standards.

Harish Kumar RK assistant director Science and Standard Division FSSAI was the first speaker for the session. He highlighted the roles and responsibilities of FSSAI and detailed the process of drafting a regulation at FSSAI.

He said the industry has long been focused on food products but not on the safety aspects of the packaging/ packaging material and for this reason there were concerns and this were addressed by FSSAI and for the same reason the FSS (Packaging & Labelling) Regulation 2011 was split into Packaging Regulation (in effect since 2019) Advertisement & Claim Regulation and Labelling & Display Regulation to give due importance to Packaging.

The FSS (Packaging) Regulation was notified on 24 December 2018 and was enforced from 1 July 2019. The FSSAI regulation is mandatory for the food business operators (FBOs) and manufacturerers of materials to ensure compliance.

Harish then explained how material-wise requirements have been specified for paper and board glass metal and metal alloys and plastics. He added that in the regulation definition of food grade has been incorporated and inks have been regulated as per IS 15495 among several other changes.

He said the recent amendment on use of recycled plastics in food packaging (which is currently only limited to rPET) and the process around the approval of use of recycled plastics.

Harish concluded his session with three key messages:

1 Need for an integrated approach: Regulatory information/knowledge to be shared among the supply chain partners

2 Safe packaging: Contributes to food safety and responsibility lies with FBOs and material manufacturers

3 Packaging regulation is a mandatory regulation and needs adherence to ensure compliance

Sagar Singh deputy director Chemical Division BIS was the next speaker on the panel. He said the standard IS 15495 which is now mandated by FSSAI is a standard created by the Bureau of Indian Standard. He said although printing inks constitutes a small part of the package its impact is immensely significant and the next big issue in sustainable packaging is printing inks.

He said the standards created by BIS are not static but dynamic in nature and recently the standard IS 15495 was revised by incorporating chemicals like toluene and certain phthalates. He also mentioned that the current ink standard is a negative list standard which restricts certain chemicals in ink formulations.

He added that the endeavour of BIS has been to adopt a positive list standard approach where only those chemicals will be prescribed which will be non-hazardous. He elaborated the standard IS 15495 citing the detailed requirements for external packaging disposables and immediate food wrappings.

The standard was first created in 2004 to assist ink manufacturers produce inks for food packaging and has been revised providing details about the revision. The work on the standard is ongoing and it includes NIAS inclusion of mineral oil and cobalt carboxylates in Annex- A xylene and methylcyclohexane in film printing of food packaging some photo initiators in Annex- A.

Singh elaborated on the concept of NIAS and concerns associated with it.

BIS is also working on developing a new standard for eco-friendly inks.

He also spoke about the digital initiatives taken by BIS to promote industry participation which includes the launch of the Standardisation Module which gives the provision to provide the comments on standards provision to become a member in the standards committee.

The speaker for the session was Jatin Takkar head – product safety and regulatory Siegwerk India. He broadly spoke about the implementation of packaging safety to ensure consumer safety. He said ensuring packaging safety is complex as there are different pillars which the food and packaging industry has to manage. This includes regional regulations and brand owner requirements and complex packaging supply chain as well as manufacturer commitments. The regional regulations are different in terms of their structure and associated details and are further supplemented by the brand owner requirements which makes it complex for the supply chain to ensure compliance. Apart from this the regulatory status of the chemicals may change over time which is yet another challenge which needs to be mitigated by the commitment from the manufacturer itself. And finally the complex packaging chain with multiple stakeholders some with expertise on chemicals safety while others with expertise on food safety.

Takkar also mentioned how packaging safety can be ensured by taking different measures across the supply chain. These include:

1 Developing understanding of packaging safety and associated legal obligations

2 Developing capabilities for creating specifications and performing risk assessment

3 Promoting transparency and integration across the supply chain

4 Developing systematic processes and mechanisms around right vendor selection

5 Deploying the monitoring as well as the auditing protocols

Takkar also emphasised upon the correct documentation practices that demonstrate packaging safety. He said currently a lot of certifications/ self-declarations issued by the manufacturers are not adequate enough to demonstrate the compliances however are well accepted by the brand owners because there is limited understanding on packaging safety associated legal obligations and systematic processes that are required to demonstrate the compliances. He shared examples of the correct certification methodology and explained all clauses that need to be captured in an authentic declaration.

He concluded his session explaining the reasons for creating more awareness on the packaging safety primarily from the brand owners and regulators’ end as well as the need for harmonising the Indian standards with the best available standards globally.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhc3Npb25hdGVpbm1hcmtldGluZy5jb20vZ291cm1ldC1pcy10aGUtZmxhdm9yLW9mLXRoZS1zZWFzb24tZm9yLWxheXMtY2hpcHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gourmet is the flavor of the season for Lay’s chips,"Potato chip brand Lay’s has just launched ‘Lay’s Gourmet’ a range of slow cooked premium crisps. Aimed at those looking for a more subtle taste experience Lay’s Gourmet is available in three flavors – Lime & Roasted Pepper Thai Sweet Chili and Vintage Cheese & Paprika.

Shailja Joshi Marketing Director Potato Chips Category PepsiCo India! that the brand’s drive to market Lay’s Gourmet began with understanding their consumers. Lay’s research indicated that Indian consumers are evolving and willing to try more premium products across the macro snack and food categories.

“Our research also showed that premium chips also performed well globally. Lay’s Gourmet is a global product and exists in many markets. So it is clear that India could look up to this product as well” adds Joshi.

For PepsiCo the Lay’s Gourmet line is a premium launch in terms of how the brand wants its consumers to perceive the product and its price point. The packaging and visual identity of the new range were also initially tested with consumers.

It is interesting to note that Indian tastes are very similar to their global counterparts. For example Lime & Black Pepper which is available in global markets has become Lime & Cracked Pepper in India. Similarly Vintage Cheddar & Caramelised Onion became Vintage Cheese & Paprika and Thai Chilli & Lime became Thai Sweet Chilli.

However he also mentions “Indian tastes may not be completely different because as a global entity we delve into our global expertise. And Lay’s stands for its international flavours. The minor changes are because the product has been redefined to keep in mind the preference of Indian consumers.”

Lay’s Gourmet will compete with Win greens’ Naan Chips (butter garlic chatpata pudding flavour) Pringles (sour cream and onion cheddar cheese grill) and other premium start-up snack brands like BRB Popped Potato Chips Hunter’s Gourmet etc.

Talking about the pricing strategy Joshi mentions that the premium range is defined by many parameters and one of them is price. “Today the overall chip category or even the packaged food category is driven by the Rs 5 or Rs 10 price tag. In this category launching something that starts at just Rs 30 is premium enough for the consumer we’re targeting because it’s three price points higher.”

While the brand has defined TG for its new launch in a certain demographic Joshi believes most of the brand’s consumers should evolve to Lay’s Gourmet on special occasions.

When it comes to the TVC for Lay’s Gourmet it is different from regular commercials. The TVC is shot in an international location and brings to life the idea of another gourmet product. The brand will soon release a 360-degree campaign.

Another thing that will be indexed more than regular Lay’s will be that the organized trade channel (modern trade and e-commerce) will basically play a very important role in terms of both sales and visibility.

Shares of Global Blood Therapeutics are surging once again after reports indicate Pfizer is the mystery suitor for the company. The stock has skyrocketed more than 38% to $66.61 per share following reports that the pharma giant could plunk down $5 billion for the sickle cell disease-focused company.

First reported by The Wall Street Journal Pfizer is looking for a quick buy of the Bay Area-based company. However there could possibly be other suitors in the mix the Journal said.

Pfizer is aiming to snap up the company and its lead product Oxbryta (voxelotor) in order to bolster its own portfolio and pipeline. Pfizer’s hematological focus is on both sickle cell disease and hemophilia. The company has an E-Selectin antagonist in development for sickle cell disease.

This identification of Pfizer as the potential buyer of GBT follows earlier reports that the company and its sickle cell disease products could be up for acquisition. That news first reported by Bloomberg sent shares of the company’s stock up more than 40% during Thursday’s trading.

Citing unnamed “people familiar with the matter” Bloomberg reported that Bay Area-based GBT has become a target of interest for “some large pharmaceutical companies.” While the discussions remain preliminary the sources told Bloomberg that GBT is working with advisers to evaluate the potential interest. Whether or not that will result in some M&A activity remains to be seen.

The company did not respond to BioSpace's request for comment.

Still the news was enough to encourage investors and the stock closed at $47.99 on Thursday up from its opening price of $43.71.

Analysts pegged the value of the company between $4.5 billion and $5.5 billion according to the report. The company’s lead product is Oxbryta (voxelotor) approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2019 for adults and children over 12 with sickle cell disease. In 2021 Oxbryta was greenlit for the treatment of sickle cell disease in patients ages four to less than 12 years old. That made Oxbryta the first FDA-approved treatment for children with SCD that directly inhibits sickle hemoglobin polymerization the root cause of the sickling and destruction of red blood cells in SCD.

In 2021 Oxbryta generated $194.7 million. That amount is set to grow following international approvals for the sickle cell disease drug.

In July the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in Great Britain granted Oxbryta marketing authorization for adult and pediatric patients over 12 as a monotherapy or in combination with hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) for the treatment of sickle cell disease. The approval marked the first medication in Great Britain that inhibits sickle hemoglobin polymerization.

That approval followed the European Commission’s authorization of Oxbryta for use in Europe.

Oxbryta is not the only sickle cell treatment in GBT’s pipeline. In June the company received both orphan drugs and rare pediatric disease designations for experimental treatments inclacumab and GBT021601. Inclacumab is a novel P-selectin inhibitor currently in Phase III studies assessing its potential to reduce the occurrence of vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) and hospital readmissions due to VOCs in patients with sickle cell disease. GBT601 is a next generation sickle hemoglobin polymerization inhibitor that is being assessed in the Phase II portion of a Phase II/III.

When the mid-stage portion of the trial was started in June Kim Smith-Whitley executive vice president and head of research and development of GBT said GBT601 has the potential to be a best-in-class therapy for sickle cell patients.

“Specifically it has the potential to improve on the clinical results achieved with Oxbryta at a lower daily dose” she said in a statement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9oZWFsdGgvMjAyMi8wOC8wNy9pdHMtYWJvdXQtZ2V0LWVhc2llci1hY2Nlc3MtYWZmb3JkYWJsZS1uYWxveG9uZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Affordable naloxone will be easier to access reversing opioid overdoses - The Washington Post,Delayed by shipping wait times and packaged in nondescript cardboard 100000 doses of Pfizer’s injectable drug were delivered Wednesday by a driver who steered two massive pallets into an unassuming warehouse that is home to the newly created nonprofit Remedy Alliance which is expected to distribute mass amounts of the drug that reverses opioid overdoses to smaller community groups.

Pfizer is aiming to seal a deal in the coming days but other suitors are still in the mix the report said.

Shares of Global Blood which makes a blood disorder drug called Oxbryta soared 44% in afternoon trade to a two-year high. The company had a market capitalization of $3.12 billion as of Thursday’s closing price.

Pfizer declined to comment on the report while a Global Blood spokesperson said it does not “comment on market rumours or speculation”.

New York-based Pfizer flush with cash from its COVID-19 vaccine is on the lookout for acquisitions that could bring in billions in annual sales by the end of the decade.

Its $11.6 billion deal for migraine drug maker Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding (BHVN.N) in May was the latest in a string of acquisitions including Trillium Therapeutics and Arena Pharmaceuticals over recent years.

Global Blood’s Oxbryta was approved in the United States for the treatment of sickle cell disease among patients 12 years and older in 2019. In December the oral drug received approval for the treatment of the condition in younger patients as well.

Sales of the drug rose more than 50% to $194.7 million in 2021.

Biotech dealmaking activity has picked up again in recent months after a bleak start to the year when a dearth of major acquisitions and clinical-stage drug failures dampened investor sentiment and squeezed funding.

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDE5LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L3BnLXNpdHRlbmZlbGQtY29ycnVwdGlvbi1jYXNlLWZlZGVyYWwtYXBwZWFscy1jb3VydC1oZWFyLWFyZ3VtZW50cy10aHVyc2RheS_SAXxodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxOS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWNvcnJ1cHRpb24tY2FzZS1mZWRlcmFsLWFwcGVhbHMtY291cnQtaGVhci1hcmd1bWVudHMtdGh1cnNkYXkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P.G. Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

PM,Philip Morris International,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vY2NycC5vcmcvZW4vaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbnMvdW5leHBsYWluZWQtd2VhbHRoLW9mLXRvcC1nZW9yZ2lhbi1qdWRnZS1oaWdobGlnaHRzLW9ic3RhY2xlcy1hbG9uZy1jb3VudHJ5cy1wYXRoLXRvLWV1cm9wZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Unexplained Wealth of Top Georgian Judge Highlights Obstacles Along Country’s Path to Europe,"In recent months tens of thousands of people in the Caucasian country of Georgia have taken to the streets to demand their government pursue integration with Europe.

“Glory to Georgia! Glory to Europe!” protesters shouted at a massive June 20 rally in the capital Tbilisi. “Soon we’ll be a member of the big European family! Long live Europe!”

After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine the European Council accepted accelerated EU membership applications from Ukraine Moldova and Georgia. But while the other two countries received candidate status approval of Georgia’s application was delayed.

Before being considered for membership the Council said Georgia must implement reforms to make its institutions more accountable and democratic.

But there’s a long way to go. One deeply-rooted problem highlighted by the local chapter of Transparency International is officials’ failure to fully declare their assets.

In a new investigation reporters from OCCRP’s Georgian partner Studio Monitor found that the problem extends to the highest levels of the country’s judiciary.

As it turns out one of Georgia’s most influential judges Levan Murusidze failed to disclose assets belonging to his long-term romantic partner in his asset declarations. This ensured that the multiple apartments expensive jewelry and designer clothes she acquired in recent years were hidden from public scrutiny.

That spending far exceeded what the couple’s declared salaries could pay for raising questions about the source of their wealth.

In a previous investigation Studio Monitor found that another influential judge Mikheil Chinchaladze had failed to declare significant real estate holdings registered to his aunt.

Murusidze and Chinchaladze are alleged to be the leaders of a powerful group of judges known as “the clan” that is said to be blocking the kind of reforms required to deepen Georgia’s ties to Europe. The two men are both associated with a powerful body called the High Council of Justice the supreme oversight body of the country’s judicial system. They’re also believed to have a close behind-the-scenes relationship with Bidzina Ivanishvili Georgia’s richest man and the éminence grise behind the country’s ruling party Georgian Dream.

Nazi Janezashvili who served for four years as a non-judge member of the High Council of Justice and is now the head of an NGO called Georgian Court Watch identifies Chinchaladze as the clan’s “irreplaceable” top leader along with Levan Murusidze.

It was Murusidze she says who helped Chinchaladze establish a behind-the-scenes relationship with Ivanishvili. “Personalities are key here and Murusidze happened to have excellent communications skills” she said.

“They got along well. Bidzina Ivanishvili’s power rests on this court system.”

Mikheil Chinchaladze and Bidzina Ivanishvili declined to comment.

Murusidze did not respond to questions about his asset declarations or his partner’s purchases only telling reporters that he was not married.

A Taste for Luxury

In an Instagram photo from 2019 three middle-aged couples pose on the crowded steps of an ancient Greek ruin.

One of the men in the photo is Judge Levan Murusidze who serves on the Tbilisi Court of Appeals. But that title does not convey the full extent of his influence: Between 2013 and 2017 he was the secretary of the High Council of Justice a powerful body that controls all judicial appointments in Georgia.

Seated in front of him is Lela Chania who works as the head of a secretariat in the Tbilisi City Court. Though the two are officially unmarried they appear to be living together and Murusidze has never denied Georgian media reports that describe her as his wife.

The couple’s relationship is also documented in an unusual place: Records pertaining to Murusidze’s charitable donations. In 2010 the prominent judge contributed to the construction fund of a monastery complex that names all its donors — and their family members — on its website. Since that year Chania has been listed as a member of Murusidze’s family alongside his mother and father.

As such she and all her significant possessions should appear in his annual asset declaration. But when journalists examined Murusidze’s declarations going back to 2006 Chania was nowhere to be found.

Chania told reporters that she does not live with Murusidze. “I don’t live anywhere permanently” she said. “I have my own place to live and if I stay somewhere else that’s none of your business.”

But apart from uncovering their joint vacations — in addition to Greece the couple also visited Portugal this year — reporters documented both Murusidze and Chania’s cars parked at Murusidze’s home in the village of Dzegvi to the northwest of Tbilisi. They also observed the couple leaving the property both in their separate cars and together. When journalists approached them the pair quickly left the scene.

It is possible that Murusidze did not declare his relationship with Chania because it would be difficult to explain her wealth: Though she comes from humble origins in recent years — a period that coincides with her relationship with Murusidze — she has made a number of expensive purchases.

In 2015 and 2016 Chania bought two apartments and two plots of land in Tbilisi plus another apartment in the Black Sea resort city of Batumi worth a total of just over $166000. Purchase agreements obtained by reporters show that she paid for them out of pocket without taking out a mortgage.

Credit: Studio Monitor In 2016 Chania bought an apartment in each of these buildings on Tbilisi’s Sairme Street (left) and King Mirian Street (right).

Until 2015 Chania was registered as living in a tiny 12-square-meter apartment and her annual salary in 2022 is listed as 33000 GEL ($12000). According to public records she owns no businesses that could provide additional income.

If Chania saved up her entire salary it would take her at least 14 years to afford her properties. She did not respond to reporter’s inquiries about how she managed to buy them and whether Murusidze was their true owner.

Credit: Lela Chania/Facebook Franco Fontana/Facebook Gucci.com Edin Pasovic Some of the luxury items acquired by Lela Chania identified from her social media posts and online shopping sites. Click to enlarge.

But Chania also has other spending to account for. Her Facebook photos which have been removed since reporters first accessed them show that she is an avid consumer of luxury brand clothing and accessories. Besides Dolce & Gabbana and Gucci her wardrobe abounds in items from Prada Moschino Furla Miu Miu Jimmy Choo Casadei and Valentino.

She also acquired dozens of expensive golden rings necklaces earrings and bracelets.

Murusidze’s own official salary of just under 73000 GEL (about $26000) per year is considerably higher than Chania’s. But it’s still insufficient to account for the extent of her possessions especially since just under half of it goes toward paying off loans taken out for the construction of his house. He has no other known sources of income.

Because none of these items were declared — as those worth over 5000 GEL ($1800) are supposed to be — the Georgian public has had no opportunity to scrutinize the couple’s purchases.

“The prosecutor’s office of Georgia should take an interest in this case especially since it involves a senior official” said Sandro Kevkhishvili the head of the anti-corruption team at Transparency International Georgia. “The Civil Service Bureau [where asset declarations are filed] has a department in charge of declaration monitoring which also must study this case.”

He also suggested a possible reform. “As far as we know … the Civil Service Bureau does not have a system for verifying whether [people are] living under one roof” he said. “This mechanism must be adopted.”

Elguja Makalatia deputy head of the bureau acknowledged that in addition to joint utility payments or transfers of money between bank accounts social media accounts can also be used as evidence that people live together.

“When we look at a public Facebook profile” he said “and it’s actually seen that people are together it’s visible [that] they’re husband and wife but they’re not in a registered marriage … then of course [they’re] considered a permanent resident.”

Besik Vekua who leads the bureau’s department for monitoring asset declarations rejected criticism of the agency. And while he says that the bureau cannot act on the basis of press reports it may review Murusidze’s case if it receives a formal referral.

“You can apply to us with a reasoned application” he told Studio Monitor. “Attach each of these arguments what you have and what you have searched for. After that the bureau will make a decision about the justification and we will conduct monitoring.”

In a separate written response to reporters’ questions about Murusidze representatives of the bureau claimed to have inspected nearly 2000 asset declarations over the past 5 years ultimately finding violations in more than half of them and issuing fines though only 11 were referred to prosecutors.

The ‘Clan’ and the Council

Murusidze is hardly the only influential judge who failed to declare all his assets and faced no consequences.

A previous investigation produced jointly by Studio Monitor and the Georgian service of Radio Free Europe Radio Tavisupleba found that another powerful judge Mikheil Chinchaladze failed to declare several apartments and garages in Tbilisi’s historic central neighborhood of Vera that had been purchased by his aunt for 105000 lari ($63000) in 2009.

Two sources who own apartments in the same building and know Chinchaladze personally told reporters that he was the true owner of the real estate registered in his aunt’s name. Regardless he should have declared the assets during a period when she was living with him in his home.

Chinchaladze never responded to reporters’ questions about these apartments and did not deny any aspect of the story after it was broadcast. Nevertheless he appears to have faced no consequences. The Civil Service Bureau told reporters that no violations had been identified in his 2019 declaration.

The Murisidze and Chinchaladze cases are especially noteworthy since both judges’ independence has been called into question.

Both men have been described by knowledgeable insiders as top figures in a group of judges believed to have gained control of Georgia’s judiciary using their influence to protect their own jobs and possibly even to influence the outcomes of specific cases.

The group popularly known as the “clan” or the “clan of judges” has no formal structure and its full extent is unknown though it is thought to consist of about 30 judges. The group has not been formally investigated by the authorities and there is no hard evidence of corruption among its members. But its existence and alleged pernicious influence has been described by independent watchdogs senior politicians and officials and international organizations.

Kakha Tsikarishvili formerly an assistant to the head of Georgia’s Supreme Court is now a member of a group of independent lawyers calling for judicial reforms. He said it’s difficult to name concrete cases of corruption within the judiciary.

“For the most part it exists in the form of instructions given to judges on what kind of decisions they’re expected to deliver” he said. “Clan members tell judges to make one decision or another. The judge follows orders and the clan makes money off the relevant case.”

The members of this group are said to include the heads of many district and city courts as well as members of the High Council of Justice which plays a crucial role in Georgia’s judicial system. This body appoints all judges across the country and also has the authority to punish or fire judges for poor performance and to reward good work including by granting lifetime appointments.

The council is made up of eight judges six non-judge members (typically lawyers) and a chairperson. Murusidze himself served as the secretary between 2013 and 2017. A number of judges on the council — both former and current — reportedly have close personal and professional connections to Chinchaladze. In 2017 the council made him the first judge in Georgia ever to be appointed for life.

Tsikarishvili the judicial reform advocate echoes the allegations that this group of judges has established a mutually beneficial relationship with the highest echelons of power in Georgia. “We see that Georgian Dream is taking steps to slowly hand over the judicial system to the clan” he said.

The European Commission has made a number of recommendations which must be addressed if Georgia’s EU integration is to progress.

One of those is to “ensure a judiciary that is fully and truly independent accountable and impartial.” Another is to “implement the commitment to ‘de-oligarchisation’ by eliminating the excessive influence of vested interests in economic political and public life.”

The Commission did not mention Ivanishvili personally. But at the massive June 20 rally in Tbilisi Rasa Juknevičienė a member of the European Parliament made clear that it had a specific name in mind.

“Everyone knows which oligarch we are talking about” she said. “Please do not let your beautiful country become a hostage.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlc3BvcnRzcnVzaC5jb20vZjEtbmV3cy1ob3ctamVhbi10b2R0LXJldGFpbmVkLTIwMC1taWxsaW9uLXRpdGxlLXNwb25zb3JzaGlwLWRlYWwtaW4tMjAwNy1hbWlkc3QtZmV1ZC13aXRoLWNoYWlybWFuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Jean Todt retained $200 Million title sponsorship deal for Ferrari in 2007 amidst feud with chairman,"In 2007 Ferrari signed a $200 Million 5-year sponsorship deal with Marlboro spearheaded by Jean Todt despite disagreements with leadership.

The Tobacco giant first appeared in the liveries of Ferrari’s F1 cars in 1984. And in 1997 when Marlboro became the title sponsor of Scuderia Ferrari’s F1 team.

This was Ferrari’s golden era in F1. The Italian team won 5 consecutive Championship titles between 2000 and 2004 with the great Michael Schumacher behind the wheels of the ‘Prancing horse.’

With an iconic driver Marlboro’s logo was evidently displayed. F1 was also televised worldwide giving brands an edge to make an international presence by Sponsoring an F1 team.

And Marlboro tried to seize the opportunity by renewing its sponsorship with Ferrari. But Ferrari’s team had pricked fractions on whether to continue with the deal or move ahead.

Why Ferrari’s Chairman wanted to reject Marlboro

Ferrari wasn’t the only F1 team to have a partnership with a Tobacco giant. But there was increasing global pressure to ban tobacco advertisements which could impact the image of Ferrari.

This was a time when Ferrari was adored. Micheal Schumacher was every kid’s childhood hero and they had a poster of the 7-time World Champion sporting a Tobacco company on his gear. Thus the image of Ferrari was being questioned by many groups.

And Ferrari’s chairman Luca Di Montezemolo wanted to take Marlboro off the car for 2007. He had instructed his team and was keen on getting a non-tobacco sponsor to Maranello.

Montezemolo invited Sir Martin Sorrell CEO of WPP Group the world’s biggest advertising agency group to Maranello. He wanted to discuss whether WPP and its network of sponsorship agencies could help find a new title sponsor for 2007.

But the former team Principal Jean Todt hijacked the visit of Sorrell. And in the aftermath signed the biggest sponsorship deal to date done by any sports team.

How Marlboro signed a $200 Million deal with Ferrari

Jean Todt the former team Principal of Ferrari wanted to keep Marlboro as Ferrari’s sponsor. He was friends with Louis Camilleri the chairman of Altria the Marlboro parent company.

When Todt heard of Sorrell’s visit to Maranello he acted quickly. Todt met Sorrell and asked him why he was there. The Frenchman told Ferrari had renewed a deal with Marlboro. Sorrell wondered that he and the visit had effectively wasted his time.

But as Sorrell was leaving Montezemolo found him and ushered him into a small adjacent conference room. But it was too late as Sorrell told the Chairman of Ferrari about Todt’s move.

Todt had brokered a five-year deal with Camilleri. Marlboro will pay $200 million a year to Ferrari. It was the biggest sponsorship deal ever in Formula One and the team could not turn down an offer.

PSX,Phillips 66,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbXBhYmF5LmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvcmF5cy8yMDIyLzA4LzA2L3JheXMtZmluZGluZy13YXlzLXRvLWtlZXAtdGhlLXBhcnR5LWdvaW5nLWFmdGVyLWRlYWxpbmctYnJldHQtcGhpbGxpcHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rays finding ways to keep the party going after dealing Brett Phillips,"DETROIT — The departure of popular outfielder Brett Phillips left various voids.

Photos of his key moments were taken off the Tropicana Field walls (as the Rays have done with other traded players). Chloe Grimes the young cancer patient from St. Petersburg who Phillips befriended in April understandably was upset to hear he was headed to Baltimore. And the team had to change a couple of its celebrations.

When a Ray hit a home run Phillips would greet him in front of the dugout to remove his helmet (a role he took over from previously traded Willy Adames) and celebrate with a personalized dance move of some sort.

With Kevin Kiermaier — the usual master of ceremonies for their clubhouse victory celebrations — sidelined with a hip injury Phillips had stepped into the disco ball spotlight calling out key performers after wins as the music blared.

Now those have become team efforts.

When Brandon Lowe homered Thursday night there was a group welcome.

“No helmet off (Thursday) but no shortage of guys up at the front of the dugout” Lowe said. “I think that’s a ‘Philly’ thing. We’re not going to steal it from ‘Philly.’ I hope he brings it to Baltimore and he brings the energy over there. But there’s no shortage of guys giving high-fives. The excitement is still there.”

Postgame the Rays are planning to have the star(s) from their previous win run the show still sorting out how best to do so.

“No one can do what ‘KK’ did” Lowe said. “‘KK’ brought a different kind of energy but we’re doing our best to fill the void while he’s gone. …

“We’re still working out some kinks. But it’s something that when you win you’ve got to celebrate your win. Don’t come in and sit at your locker and be quiet. You won a baseball game let’s have some fun with it celebrate it and move on.”

They’re pretty confident the party will continue.

“It was great energy (Thursday) … and a lot of fun. We’re going to try and keep that going” All-Star Shane McClanahan said. “Obviously those were two huge guys in our clubhouse. This is what we’ve got now and we’re going to do the best we can with it.”

“We had ‘KK’ and then ‘Philly’ so we’re improvising a bit now” Randy Arozarena said via team interpreter Manny Navarro. “But (it’s good) as long as everyone’s happy and we keep winning.”

Phillips a Seminole High product and fan favorite was designated for assignment Monday after the Rays acquired Jose Siri from Houston and traded on Tuesday to Baltimore. Before heading out of town he made a surprise visit to see Grimes and deliver a custom glove they had designed together and he had made for her.

Your uplifting moment of the day brought to you by…you guessed it Brett Phillips & Chloe.



Brett surprised Chloe who as we all know is battling cancer at her house & brought over the glove they designed together.

“Words can not express how much it means to me that he made time in his day with all the things going on in his life to make sure she is okay” Grimes’ mother posted on Facebook. “He is a selfless man whose compassion and HEART of GOLD is BIGGER than baseball.”

With his No. 35 worn by Orioles young star catcher Adley Rutschman the always enterprising Phillips went for a high-octane option. It’s no coincidence his jersey now reads like a gas station ad: “Phillips 66.”

He also told Baltimore media he not only was excited to join the Orioles he was “looking to win a World Series” with them saying it “would be freaking awesome.” The trade for an undisclosed amount of cash reunited Phillips with former Seminole High teammate Joey Krehbiel an Orioles reliever as well as Baltimore general manager Mike Elias the Astros’ scouting director when Phillips was a sixth-round pick in 2012.

Trade rumblings

What would it have taken for the Rays to rent Juan Soto for a couple of years? Based on what the Nationals got from the Padres for him and Josh Bell something like a five-six player package that would have included Arozarena top prospects Taj Bradley and Curtis Mead and some combination of Shane Baz Xavier Edwards Josh Lowe Isaac Paredes and Luis Patino. … Bradley and Mead were by far the most popular asks though the Rays got multiple inquiries on Tyler Glasnow as well as prospects Cole Wilcox and Junior Caminero among others. … There were at least some initial trade talks about Ji-Man Choi which could have opened a spot for prospect Jonathan Aranda. … Part of the reason for dealing pitching prospects Seth Johnson and Jayden Murray? They had to be added to the 40-man roster this offseason or exposed to being lost in the Rule 5 draft. … Jim Bowden writing for The Athletic gave the Rays a C+ for their deadline work saying trading Johnson who just underwent Tommy John surgery may haunt them. … Fangraphs.com’s Ben Clemens labeled their moves “Frenzied and Confusing.” … ESPN.com’s Bradford Doolittle concluded: “As ever hoping small moves pay off big.”

Rays rumblings

After having Monday and Thursday off the Rays have a rugged stretch — playing 17 straight days getting two off in a four-day span then closing with 33 games (including a doubleheader) in 34 days. … Entering play Saturday the Rays had the toughest remaining schedule of AL teams with an opponent winning percentage of .531. ... Former Rays PR chief Rick Vaughn has written an interesting book about the rich history of spring training called “100 Years of Baseball on St. Petersburg’s Waterfront” with a signing 6 p.m. Tuesday at the St. Petersburg Museum of History. … It will be most interesting to see if the Rays and Kiermaier have mutual interest in working out a deal for a reduced salary in 2023 or if they part ways once his $13 million option is declined (and he gets a $2.5 million buyout). ... Condolences to the family of Rudy Padron a 23-year member of the RaysVision crew who died last week of cancer. … Ex-Rays reliever Shawn Camp was named head coach at George Mason University having been an assistant for three seasons and playing there from 1995-97. … Under a draft of the 2023 schedule being circulated the Rays open at home March 30 vs. Detroit.

But a recently released study has shed new light on how exposure to airborne pollutants can also affect the developing brains of the very young.

Researchers have found that toddlers exposed to particulate matter score lower on IQ tests—losing as many as 2.63 points on those exams for every 2 micrograms per cubic meter of pollution exposure.

And the harm from pollution researchers found can begin long before birth: Children of pregnant women who were exposed to air pollution from fossil fuel exhaust and particulate matter in utero are more likely to experience behavioral problems and poor cognitive performance they report.

The findings part of a peer-reviewed study in the June issue of the journal Environmental Health Perspectives builds on a growing body of research examining the effects of pre- and postnatal exposure to pollution on children. A previous study had found for example that toddlers have a 6% increased risk of behavioral problems for every 2 parts per billion of nitrogen dioxide to which they are exposed. Nitrogen dioxide is commonly found in vehicle exhaust and emissions from industrial plants.

Taken together researchers said the findings bolster earlier hypotheses about the broad impacts of airborne pollutants on childhood health and development.

One of the most concerning aspects of the study for parents of young children is the ubiquity of air pollutants researchers said.

“Air pollutants are something that everybody is exposed to every day of our lives” said the study’s lead author Yu Ni an epidemiologist at the University of Washington. “It is cumulative and it is indoor and outdoor. You just cannot avoid it at all. You can do something to prevent and to protect yourself but you just cannot say that I have zero exposure to air pollution at all.”

The exposure risk is particularly acute for young children Ni said: Because of their small stature they are closer to the ground and consequently have a greater chance of breathing in higher amounts of dust and other particulate matter. Children also typically breathe at a faster rate than adults which may cause them to take in more particles in a shorter amount of time than those who are older.

Ni also noted that for some children the risks begin while they are still in utero and their mothers are breathing in nitrogen dioxide. The study found that children born to pregnant people who were exposed to high levels of nitrogen dioxide particularly in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy had more behavioral problems than other children.

Catherine Karr a pediatrician and environmental epidemiologist at the University of Washington and the senior author of the study said that continued exposure to pollutants both in utero and after birth increases the potential of long-term adverse health effects.

The study’s authors emphasize that they adjusted the results for sociodemographic behavioral and psychological factors to zero in on the role played by air contaminants. “What contributes to a child’s overall health and in this case healthy development of brain and behavior?” said Karr who is a professor at the university’s School of Public Health and School of Medicine. “Healthy nutrition a good night’s sleep feeling safe feeling loved. Air pollution is just part of that formula.

“It’s just another potential insult. And it might be in the context of any one child—it might be the thing that kind of tips them into a direction where it really becomes a clinical diagnosis. It becomes something that is really problematic in their everyday life.”

Researchers studied nearly 2000 pregnant people in six different cities before and after they gave birth. Once the children were born and grew into toddlerhood researchers conducted IQ tests to measure cognitive abilities and evaluated them with the Child Behavior Checklist a tool commonly used by therapists and other caregivers to evaluate behavior problems.

One of the researchers Kaja LeWinn a social epidemiologist at University of California San Francisco said that while the results of the study are compelling on their own they also add to a growing body of research on the effects of air pollution on children especially those from low-income households and marginalized communities.

“We’re seeing this consistently” LeWinn said citing a study that found that people of color are exposed to higher levels of particulate matter pollution than other Americans. “These disparities or these social inequities are along the lines of race ethnicity as well as of economic status. That is something I feel like we need to pay attention to.”

Nicholas Newman a pediatrician who was not involved in the study said the research underscored the importance of continued research into how pollutants affect parts of the body that are not related to breathing ailments.

“As we’re finding out that there are effects on the body beyond the respiratory system in the air what is probably of most interest right now is how it affects the developing brain” said Newman an associate professor of pediatrics and environmental and public health sciences at the University of Cincinnati. “Some of the things that we’re concerned about are how these particularly small particles may either get into the brain directly and affect it or cause another problem there.”

Ni said that researchers hope their work can inform public policy decisions around the mitigation of hazardous particles in the air. “The U.S. has gone a long way under the Clean Air Act to reduce air pollution so compared to many countries the air pollution levels inside the U.S. are relatively low” she said. “So we feel like maybe in the future policy can have an even lower threshold level.”

Ni said she also hopes that steps can be taken to protect especially vulnerable populations including high-risk pregnant women and children who live with respiratory ailments from the harmful effects of air pollution.

Karr underlines that the research also has implications for efforts to address climate change.

“Air pollution and climate change are inextricably linked” Karr said. “So if we start to really get serious about addressing climate change we’re going to have a reduction in some of these air pollutants that also have direct health consequences.”

California’s Pinnacles National Park may be overshadowed by the state’s other bigger and more well-known parks like Yosemite Death Valley and Joshua Tree. But if you’re looking for a laid-back place to recreate where you can take in mountain views explore cool caves and maybe spot the endangered California condor Pinnacles is certainly worth a visit.

This park operated by the National Park Service (NPS) is east of the Salinas Valley in central California roughly 270 miles northwest of Los Angeles and 130 miles southeast of San Francisco.

History of Pinnacles National Park

Pinnacles National Park is the result of multiple ancient volcanic eruptions near the San Andreas Fault some 23 million years ago. The park was named after the ‘‘pinnacles’’ rock formations which are the eroded remains of an ancient lava field and the famous talus caves were formed when canyons filled with boulders from the cliffs above.

Towering rock spires teeming with rugged grandeur dominate the landscape standing as ancient sentinels of nature’s prowess. Carved by millennia of wind and water these majestic rock formations evoke awe and inspire wonder. Their sheer magnitude and intricate beauty invite adventurers to explore and marvel at the raw power of geological forces.

The first 2500 acres of the park were proclaimed a national monument in 1908. Since then it significantly increased in size to 26000 acres and in 2013 President Barack Obama designated it a national park status. Pinnacles thus became the ninth unit in the National Park System in California to be named a national park.

There are some quirks and interesting things about this particular national park that you’ll want to know about before you arrive. Here’s the scoop.

10 Great Tips for Visiting Pinnacle National Park

1. The Park’s Two Sides Aren’t Connected By A Road

This is important to be aware of before you make a plan to visit Pinnacles National Park: There is a west entrance about 10 miles northeast of Soledad California that’s accessible via CA 146 a windy one-lane road not recommended for RVs trailers or large vehicles. There is also an east entrance about 35 miles southeast of Hollister California. These entrances are not connected by roads that cross the park.

So unless you want to hike across the park on maintained trails (the shortest route is about 3 miles one way) you’ll have access only to the services on each side. The west side of the park has picnic and parking areas plus restrooms and trailheads. The east side is more developed with a campground visitor center general store and access to more trailheads than the west side.

2. Pinnacles National Park Is Small

Established in 2013 Pinnacles is one of the country’s newest national parks. At 26685 acres it’s also one of the smallest national parks in the U.S.— the seventh smallest of the 63 national parks in the United States to be exact.

You don’t need a ton of time to get to know this national park. You could dip into the park on either side (see above!) and make a day trip out of picnicking hiking and bird watching. Or you might camp overnight in Pinnacles Campground on the east side and plan on a couple of different day hikes over two days.

But unlike some large national parks that require several days to do more than scratch the surface of their offerings Pinnacles can be covered pretty well in two days.

3. Hiking Is Awesome And Varied

Thirty miles of hiking trails ranging from easy to strenuous wind their way through the park whose diverse landscapes and interesting rock formations are a result of an ancient volcanic eruption. On a June RV camping trip at Pinnacles during a heat wave — daytime temperatures reached an incredible 105 degrees Fahrenheit — my husband and I managed a couple of hikes.

One night after dinner as the sun set we strolled along the mellow Bench Trail that begins in the campground and ultimately leads to the Bear Gulch parking area. We didn’t make it that far — it’s 2.3 miles one way — but appreciated the opportunity to walk in the shade of large cottonwood trees on a flat path. At one point we crossed over a fenced area and learned interestingly that there’s a 30-mile perimeter fence to keep out destructive wild pigs.

We also cobbled together a few different trails to make a 5-mile loop that began and ended in the Bear Gulch parking area. First we ascended about a mile along the moderate Condor Gulch Trail to a lookout that afforded great valley views. We ascended further up the trail and across the High Peaks trail weaving around giant rock formations while appreciating the shade they cast — a welcome break from the hot sun even though we’d set out before 7 a.m. Here we enjoyed 360-degree views of the surrounding mountains and towering spires.

Our loop also included ascending and descending the “steep and narrow” section of the High Peaks Trail where metal rails and steps carved into the rock can help hikers steady themselves. Along the way back down we passed a few spots specifically marked for rock climbers. We appreciated the cooler foliage as we decreased in elevation and found ourselves at the Moses Spring parking area before heading back to where our vehicle was parked in Bear Gulch.

If we had more time to spend at Pinnacles or if we visit again I’d like to sample the hiking trails that originate from the Chaparral Parking Area on the west side of the park. For example the easy-to-moderate trail that loops together the Balconies Cliff Trail and the Balconies Cave Trail is 2.4 miles and features a scramble through the talus passages of Balconies Cave. While on the trail it is necessary to carry a flashlight or wear a headlamp.

4. Summer Is Hot In Pinnacles National Park

As noted we happened to visit Pinnacles National Park as steamy temperatures swept across California and Nevada in mid-June. However it seems high summer temperatures aren’t that unusual according to the park’s website.

It can regularly reach 90 degrees Fahrenheit and soar above 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer. There are no cooling coastal breezes since the park is located sufficiently inland (e.g. a 50-mile drive from Monterey). Carrying plenty of water while hiking is key as is getting out on the trail before the sun peaks in the sky. Spring and fall are actually more popular times to visit Pinnacles National Park since the temperatures are milder then. Wildflowers are also abundant between March and May.

5. The Campground Is Basic But There’s A Pool

Pinnacles Campground on the east side of the park is operated by an outside vendor Pinnacles Recreation Company. It offers RV spots individual and group tent campsites and tent cabins with beds but those are BOYB (bring your own bedding). RV sites have 30 amp electrical hook-ups and there are communal water spigots (bring your own water jugs).

Significantly this campground does have a swimming pool — quite unusual for campgrounds found in United States national parks. No surprise it was packed with campers when we visited during a heat wave — a welcome respite from the hot temperatures.

Restrooms with showers are located next to the pool and are available to overnight campers and day-use visitors. Showers are coin-operated — 50 cents for 3 minutes. They looked pretty grungy so I had little interest in using them. We’d planned ahead and had plenty of fresh water in our RV tank for cool refreshing showers at the end of a hot day.

At the Pinnacles campground there is a ranger-staffed visitor center and a campground office where you can pick up park maps. There’s also a small store offering basic supplies snacks drinks ice and souvenirs.

6. You Can Explore Bat-Filled Caves

Two big draws at Pinnacles National Park are Bear Gulch Cave and Balconies Cave both home to bat colonies. These are talus caves which are openings that are created by piles of boulders. Hiking trails lead to and through the caves and you’ll need a flashlight to make your way through the dark tunnels.

Bear Gulch Cave is closed seasonally while the mama Townsend’s big-eared bats a protected species give birth and raise their babies. Be sure to check the status of the caves before heading out on your hike. Unfortunately both caves were closed when I visited in June.

7. California Condors Live Here

California condors are North America’s largest bird with wingspans about 9-and-a-half feet long. They can live up to 60 years. These majestic creatures became an endangered species in the 1960s and in the 1980s there were only 25 known condors left in the world. The wild birds were trapped and bred to avoid extinction.

Eventually the captive-bred condors were released in five different areas of California including Pinnacles National Park. Today dozens make their home in the park and if you can get close enough to one you might spot their numbered tags which help wildlife conservationists keep track of them.

Keep in mind however that the California condor is easily confused with its much smaller cousin the turkey vulture. (Hint: The condor has large white triangular patches under its spread wings.)

While hiking my husband and I were convinced we’d spotted a handful of condors roosting in a tree and we excitedly told a pair of other hikers on our route. “Yeah those are probably vultures” said one gentleman with a pair of binoculars who went on to describe the numbered condors he’d seen earlier in the day. (Clearly the man knew what he was talking about.)

While you keep your eye out for the endangered California condor there are plenty of other birds to observe in Pinnacles National Park including falcons golden eagles hawks wrens and swallows.

8. Parking Lots Can Fill Up Early

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic a shuttle operated between the East Pinnacles Visitor Center and the Bear Gulch parking area among other spots on the east side of the park. The shuttles have been suspended with no signs of returning anytime soon. That means parking spots fill quickly at parking areas that service popular hiking trails. But remember the fact that Pinnacles National Park is one of California’s three least visited national parks so there should still be some parking spots available.

The National Park Service notes there may be long lines and delays getting into the park between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. If you want to secure parking to hike the Condor Gulch High Peaks or Moses Spring trails arrive by 8 a.m. (plus you’ll beat the worst of the heat in the summer months).

The Causeway team celebrate with the Neilus Flynn cup after the Kerry County Senior Hurling Championship Final match between Ballyduff and Causeway at Austin Stack Park in Tralee Photo by Brendan Moran/Sportsfile

Causeway 2-15

Ballyduff 0-16

They won’t come must sweeter than that for Causeway.

In the year they were supposedly under the gun short for numbers early doors and underdogs in the final against their nearest and dearest in Ballyduff the maroon and white regained the Neilus Flynn for their ninth championship success with a display of grit power determination and no little skill.

Stephen Goggin’s men played the game with passion pride and a disruptive spirit that had Ballyduff on the back-foot more often than not. This was a game played on Causeway’s terms much more so than it was Ballyduff’s.

With Jason Diggins running the show from his centre-half back / sweeper’s role Ballyduff’s must-vaunted forward line never got the sort of rhythm we’ve seen them display more often than not this campaign.

Indeed where just three of Ballyduff’s starting six scored from play – and with neither Boyle brother raising a flag from play – five of Causeway’s delivered from play and the sixth Daniel O’Mahoney was playing as a defender tracking Ballyduff danger man Kevin Goulding (who was limited to just a single score).

To be fair to Ballyduff it’s not as if they completely misfired. They were denied twice for goals by veteran shot-stopper John Mike Dooley and really it wasn’t until the last five or ten minutes that the pendulum swung completely against them.

Up to then up until Causeway kicked for home with a vengeance including a 60th minute goal from Brandon Barrett Ballyduff probably had the better of the play in the second half. The goal they probably needed though just wouldn’t come.

That’s down to a serious display to Causeway’s defence led by the aforementioned Diggins and ably assisted by guys like Keith Carmody – a Trojan presence in the middle third – and Anthony Fealy who spent much of the day tracking Mikey Boyle.

From a one-point game on 50 minutes for Causeway to run out five-point winners shows you just what these men are made of. It was quite simply the stuff of champions. All the way through they showed that sort of fortitude not at all being rattled by whatever Ballyduff brought to the table.

Indeed the way Ballyduff began the game was more than reminiscent of the way they’ve been starting games all season long with a pair of beautiful points inside the opening three minutes which seemed to indicate their intent.

As it was those two opening scores near carbon copies from Eoin Ross from the railway side line into the Mitchels’ end were a little bit of a false dawn as the green and white failed to find the fluency that’s defined their season to date.

To be fair they were hurling well enough probably the better of the two sides in the opening quarter all-in-all they just didn’t have much of a lead to show for it. As a matter of fact at the end of fifteen minutes it was all square at three points a piece.

Causeway hit three on-the-trot in response to Ross’ openers through Paul McGrath Joseph Diggins and a free from Brandon Barrett before a Pádraig Boyle ‘65 levelled it back up after John Mike Dooley saved brilliantly from a Jack O’Sullivan goal chance (assist Kieran O’Carroll).

Ballyduff were out to a two-point lead by the twentieth minute mark – 0-5 to 0-3 – and with Tommy Casey picking up a nasty enough looking injury it was looking a difficult situation for Causeway.

Or so one would have thought. Instead they rallied magnificently led by Barrett to shoot 1-3 without reply. First scores from frees by Barrett and Paul McGrath. Then a brilliant point from play by Dan Goggin and finally a goal to wow the TG4 cameras by man-of-match Colum Harty.

The former Kerry captain is some man to score big goals on big days and having taken an assist by Joseph Diggins went on a screaming run jinking and shimming his way from distance before slamming to the back of PJ O’Gorman’s goal to give his side a four-point advantage 0-5 to 1-6.

Ballyduff brought it back to a two-point game again on 29 – following a Pádraig Boyle ‘65 and an excellent score from play by a classy Kevin Goulding – but Causeway seemed to have it within themselves to keep the gap.

And with late points from Paul McGrath Barrett and Harty the eventual champions it back to a four-point lead at the break 1-9 to 0-8. Advantage to them even if Ballyduff did have the breeze into the Horan’s end for the second half.

There were times it felt in that second half like Ballyduff were on the cusp of really roaring back into it. Garry O’Brien’s men however just couldn’t get over that hump couldn’t completely eradicate that deficit.

On a couple of occasions they had it back to a single point game – on 42 minutes following a Pádraig Boyle free – and again on 50 with Pádraig assisting Jack O’Sullivan for a fine point from play.

Causeway though were always able to keep them at that little bit of arm’s length and with points from Barrett (a pair of frees) and Gavin Dooley (in his first significant intervention of the game) had it back out to four 1-15 to 0-14 on 55.

Five minutes later Causeway doubled that advantage with Dooley involved in the build up as Barrett managed to scramble home a scrappy goal with is foot. It all but confirmed the win for the underdogs. No less than they deserved truth be told.

Their little bit of extra experience told against a sometimes nervy looking Ballyduff outfit. Their time will no doubt come. This day this year however belongs to Causeway and their ebullient and indefatigable manager Stephen Goggin.

He never lost faith in these players and these players never lost faith in him in turn. They both got their just rewards in the August sunshine. The celebrations are just beginning.

Even though the company has kept its headquarters in Arizona for three decades and even though you already might use its popular electronic-payment system Zelle the business has kept a low profile.

Until now.

With the robust growth of Zelle — now available to 150 million consumers and thousands of businesses nationally — Early Warning is seeking more visibility.

""We have been based in Scottsdale for decades"" said Melissa Lowry chief marketing officer at Early Warning. ""We stayed under the radar until the launch of Zelle.""

New location for established company

Early Warning this month marked the grand opening of its new 125000-square foot headquarters at 5801 N. Pima Rd. The company now employs 1100 people 70% of whom live in Arizona and still has 180 unfilled positions.

Early Warning also has offices in San Francisco and Chicago.

Prior to Zelle Early Warning developed other services including a quick identification-verification system.

""When you open a bank account we can verify your ID in minutes"" Lowry said.

Other services include those geared to locating accounts and assessing customer risks.

Early Warning is a private company owned by seven large financial institutions — Bank of America Capital One Chase PNC Truist U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo. As such it doesn't disclose financial details such as revenue.

But small businesses are a growth area for Zelle Lowry said with companies able to handle payments including payroll through the system. Property managers contractors and health and beauty providers are among the users.

Many larger companies also use Zelle such as to disburse money to consumers as a fast safe alternative to writing checks.

This Tempe company has created an alternative to lumber: Builders are starting to take notice

Popularity expands steadily

Combined consumers and businesses sent 1.8 billion payments through the Zelle network in 2021 an increase of 49% from a year earlier. Those payments totaled $490 billion up 59%.

Many banks and other financial companies offer the service for free to their customers. Payments typically are sent and received using smart phones or through a financial institution's website.

The Zelle network the market leader in this type of payment service is available through nearly 10000 financial institutions roughly triple the number of a year ago.

As easy and convenient as Zelle is to send and receive payments users should send money only to those friends family members and businesses they know and trust.

Once a payment has been submitted it can't be retrieved or canceled (unless the recipient hasn't yet enrolled in the service). Payments are typically sent and received within minutes.

Mike Egeck -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks Caitlin and good morning everyone. Thank you all for joining us and please note that we have posted a deck on the Leslie's IR site to supplement our discussion. I'm going to discuss three things today: number one the overview of our Q3 results and underlying performance drivers; number two the execution challenges in one of our distribution centers that was the primary driver of our Q3 sales and margin shortfall and the steps we have taken to correct the issue; number three supply chain challenges and increased industry promotions which also impacted results for the quarter. After that Steve will review in detail our financial results and change in full year guidance.

Our Q3 performance continued our streak of record results but it fell short of our internal expectations. Our organization and leadership team fully understand that this outcome is not acceptable and that we missed a significant opportunity to serve more customers in the quarter. There is a heightened sense of urgency and accountability across our organization and we are hyper-focused on the actions necessary to rapidly and sustainably improve our execution. Despite our disappointment in underperforming our expectations our year-over-year performance illustrates our continued market share growth driven by our competitive advantages in serving the aftermarket pool industry.

Sales for the quarter increased 13% to $674 million with broad-based strength across our three consumer groups. Residential pool grew 7% for the quarter PRO pool grew 17% and residential hot tub grew 94%. Comp sales increased 7% for the quarter and the two-year stack comp for the quarter was 27%. Page 15 of the supplemental deck utilizes third-party credit card data to compare our year-to-date sales performance by quarter versus our competition.

As you can see from the chart we continue to gain share. Gross profit for the quarter was a record $304 million. However margin rate decreased 250 basis points driven by business mix product margin headwinds and DC expense. Adjusted EBITDA was a record $183 million for the quarter.

Moving to the industry backdrop. The pool and hot tub industry continued to benefit from strong consumer demand in the quarter and the secular trends driving that demand remain intact. First consumers investing in their homes and backyards. Second the desire for a healthy outdoor lifestyle.

Third migration to the Sun Belt. Fourth a heightened sense of safety and sanitization. And finally hybrid and work-from-home schedules. With regard to inflation product cost inflation was approximately 8% in the quarter.

For Q4 we are now planning product cost inflation to be in the high single digits. And we will continue to manage our suggested retail prices to offset the increased costs. Now I would ask that you please turn to Page 7 of the supplemental deck. Given the noise in our results this quarter we've included a bridge between our third quarter expectations and our actual performance to help explain the moving parts.

As you can see a significant driver of the sales and margin miss was the result of challenges at our New Jersey DC. We operate six distribution centers in total and the New Jersey DC fulfills store and digital demand for our Northeast region. The New Jersey DC shipped about 30% fewer units than planned in the third quarter which resulted in significant store out of stocks throughout the Northeast and also impacted our ability to serve digital demand in the region. A confluence of factors contributed to the facilities' underperformance.

First the Northeast experienced wet and cold weather through April and May which resulted in a late start to the pool season and concentrated demand into June at an unprecedented level. Concurrently supply chain disruptions moderated which resulted in unforeseen levels of vendor shipments and DC receiving. And quite simply we didn't have the staffing and plan in place to support this combination of factors. As a result of this concentrated demand and unprecedented volume of receipts we faced operating challenges that significantly impacted our ability to serve customers.

As you can see relative to our expectations the challenges in our New Jersey DC impacted sales by $35 million and margin by a total of $21 million in the quarter. We reacted quickly to this situation by increasing temporary headcount and adding work shifts. By the second week of July the facility was back shipping to plan but it was operating with twice the headcount of the prior year increasing headcount in the facility that quickly is highly inefficient. As a result the facility both underperformed and added cost.

The additional expense was approximately $3 million in Q3 and we have planned an additional $7 million for Q4. We are taking action to ensure that we can manage through potential issues like this in the future. Prior to the start of the 2023 pool season we plan to implement a seven-day a week two-shift operating model for all of our DCs and add additional 3PL partners in specific trading areas including the Northeast. This will ensure that we have the additional capacity to navigate potential headwinds like this in the future.

Outside the impact of the DC the balance of the business outperformed our internal sales expectations by approximately $14 million. Two other points to note on the bridges on Page 7. First decreases in product margin rate impacted margin by $8 million in the quarter. The decrease consisted primarily of two factors.

Supply shortages from planned vendor receipts in season that required higher cost substitutes to serve consumer demand and an increase in industry promotions. Second the strong sales performance of our lower margin PRO and hot tub businesses resulted in an unfavorable mix that drove an $8 million reduction in gross margin for the quarter. This mix headwind is not new. But in the past we've been able to counter it with margin growth in each of our businesses.

The current macroeconomic and operating environment is challenging. And while we would certainly prefer a more favorable backdrop our historical performance during challenging times gives us confidence in our future performance. As you can see summarized on Page 14 in the deck. Over the last two decades Leslie's has been successful in profitably growing sales in periods of rising interest rates inflation housing industry slowdowns GDP contraction declines in consumer spending and reduced rates of new pool builds.

With the addition of Leslie's Connect the focus on our six strategic growth initiatives and our investments in talent and capabilities. We believe we are better equipped today to grow profitably and challenging macroeconomic conditions than any other time in our history. Now let's review the performance of our six strategic growth initiatives in the quarter. The year-to-date contribution of each initiative is also summarized on Page 9 of the supplemental deck.

First our consumer file. Total target file growth was minus 1.7% a quarter. The comparison to last year is distorted by outsized file growth in Q3 2021 driven by the pervasive media coverage of the chorine shortage. Adjusted for that event file growth was 5.5%.

The unadjusted two-year stack was 14% for the quarter. Next we continue to deepen our relationship with our consumers. Our Pool Perks loyalty file grew 1% for the quarter and now has an 18.7% more members year over year. The program's key benefits a 5% reward earn rate and free shipping continue to resonate with our consumers.

Average revenue per consumer grew 13.7% in the quarter. The growth in average revenue per consumer exceeded the impact of inflation and reflects our growing wallet share. Third our PRO initiatives are driving strong results. During the quarter we finished converting 29 residential stores to our PRO format and building five new PRO stores.

We are now operating 79 total PRO stores. Our PRO affiliate program continues to scale. We now have over 2600 agreements in place and our PRO affiliate partner sales grew 38% in the quarter. The newly converted PRO locations our expanding PRO affiliate program and our dedicated Leslie's PRO e-commerce site helped to grow PRO pool 17% in the quarter.

Moving to M&A. In the quarter we closed on the acquisition of Spring Dance which operates four residential hot tub locations in the Greater Philadelphia area. Shortly after the end of the quarter we also closed on the acquisition of Texsun which operates six retail pool locations in the Greater Houston area. We continue to see a wealth of attractive acquisition opportunities in the industry and we have entered into two additional LOIs that we expect to close by the end of our fiscal year.

With regard to our white space initiative. Year to date we have opened a total of 14 new store locations and we continue to successfully address underserved markets with targeted digital marketing. Our current store count including the recently acquired Texsun locations is 987. Finally AccuBlue Home.

We are scheduled to receive just over 2000 units of the version 2.0 devices this year. These devices will use primarily for incremental refinement of our app interface and additional consumer testing. We are not planning for any significant sales from this initiative in 2022. Now I'll turn it over to Steve to share more detail on our Q3 financial results and revised fiscal 2022 guidance.

Steve Weddell -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you Mike and good morning everyone. As Mike discussed our third quarter performance was impacted by difficult year-over-year comparisons as well as discrete execution challenges within our distribution network which are now behind us. Despite these challenges demand for our core nondiscretionary product remains solid and we are focused on delivering against our updated outlook for the year. Before I discuss our outlook I will review our third quarter and year-to-date fiscal 2022 performance.

For the third quarter we reported record sales of $673.6 million an increase of 12.9% or $77.1 million when compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Our comparable sales increased 7.4% or $44.6 million. This increase is on top of our calendar-adjusted comparable sales growth of 19.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and represents comparable sales growth on a two-year stack basis of 26.9%. Our noncomparable sales increased by $32.5 million driven by four completed acquisitions and 21 new store openings in the last year.

We continue to see broad-based strength across our three consumer groups in the quarter as we generated comparable sales growth of 6% for residential pool 17% for PRO pool and 10% for residential hot tub. On a two-year stack basis we generated comparable sales growth on a calendar-adjusted basis of 21% for residential pool 78% for PRO pool and 33% for residential hot tub. Weather for the full quarter was neutral to slightly positive but the cadence of the start to the season impacted our performance in the Northeast. Gross profit increased 7% or $19.9 million when compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and gross margin rate decreased by 250 basis points to 45.1% from 47.6% in the prior year.

During the quarter there were three main headwinds to gross margin rate continued impact from business mix lower product margins related to promotions and product costs and incremental distribution expenses. First as we've noted in prior quarters the impact of business mix is primarily driven by faster growth in our PRO pool and residential hot tub businesses which operated at lower gross margins. In the third quarter business mix accounted for 115 basis points of the decline in gross margin. Second a higher promotional cadence in our residential pool business and higher product costs associated with supply chain disruptions accounted for an additional 115 basis points of the decline in gross margin.

We believe the promotional cadence in the third quarter represents a more normalized level of promotions when compared to the prior year. Also strategic efforts to procure product to offset supply shortages from existing vendors in season led to higher-than-expected product costs and we expect this to continue through the end of the fiscal year. Third during the current quarter we incurred additional distribution expenses mainly related to higher headcount and compensation costs. The additional costs negatively impacted gross margin by 45 basis points.

Total distribution costs increased by $5 million when compared to the prior-year period and we estimate the incremental expense due to the issues at our New Jersey distribution center totaled approximately $3 million during the quarter. We will continue to incur additional costs through the remainder of the fiscal year but we are pleased that the New Jersey distribution center is now shipping to plan. And as we've noted in prior quarters occupancy leverage during the quarter favorably impacted gross margin. In the current quarter occupancy leverage improved gross margin by 25 basis points.

So to summarize the two key changes in margin drivers during the current quarter when compared to our recent performance and our internal expectations were the change in product margins and higher distribution expenses. Now I'll turn to SG&A. SG&A increased 12.1% or $14.2 million when compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and decreased as a percentage of sales by 15 basis points. While we continue to invest in information technology and merchandising systems to support our growth we were very disciplined with expense management considering our execution challenges and the heightened inflationary environment during the quarter.

We estimate inflation-impacted SG&A by approximately $10 million primarily related to payroll and digital marketing spend. The current year quarter also has an additional $4 million of noncomparable SG&A associated with acquired businesses. We generated record adjusted EBITDA of $182.9 million compared to $179.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Adjusted net income increased to $125.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to net income of $124.4 million in the prior-year period.

And adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.68 in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to $0.64 in the prior-year period. Now I'll turn to year-to-date results. Following are a few highlights. For the first nine months of fiscal 2022 we reported sales of $1.1 billion an increase of 16.3% or $152.5 million when compared to the prior-year period.

Our comparable sales increased 10.7% or $100 million. This increase is on top of our calendar-adjusted comparable sales growth of 23.4% in the first nine months of fiscal 2021 and represents comparable sales growth on a two-year stack basis of 34.1%. Non-comparable sales increased $52.5 million. Gross profit increased 12.1% or $49.5 million when compared to the prior-year period and gross margin rate decreased by 160 basis points to 42% from 43.6% in the prior-year period.

Adjusted EBITDA improved by $4.1 million to $192.7 million from $188.6 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted net income was $112.0 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2022 compared to adjusted net income of $111.0 million in the prior-year period. And adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.60 in the first nine months of fiscal 2022 and $0.59 in the prior-year period. Moving to the balance sheet.

We finished the third quarter of fiscal 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $193 million compared to $307 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2021. The reduction in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to share repurchases investments in inventory and higher M&A activity. On inventory we ended the third quarter of fiscal 2022 with $361 million up $137 million or 61% compared to $224 million at the end of the prior-year quarter. The increase in inventory is primarily related to equipment and chemicals.

Both product categories are nondiscretionary in nature and are not subject to technology or fashion risk. We have seen some recent improvements in supply chain availability as we received a significant amount of backordered products during the third quarter. However we would still characterize the current environment as mixed. As a result we view our current inventory position as appropriate given the uncertainty of supply for the balance of the year and into fiscal 2023.

On debt at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2022 we had $800 million outstanding on our secured term loan facility compared to $808 million at the end of the prior-year period. The applicable rate on our term loan during the quarter was LIBOR plus 250 basis points. Our effective interest rate was 3.02% and the facility matures in March of 2028. Funded debt less cash totaled $607 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2022.

With regard to our outlook. Today we are revising our full year fiscal 2022 outlook the details of which are included in our earnings press release. As we only have one more quarter left in the fiscal year I will be discussing each metric in the context of our implied fourth quarter outlook. Fiscal fourth quarter sales growth will be in the range of 13% to 18% with comparable sales growth of 6% to 9%.

Changes to our outlook since may include two items. First we lowered fourth quarter performance expectations by $21 million to reflect performance more in line with third quarter trends. In the third quarter we generated comparable sales growth of 27% on a two-year stack basis. And our outlook reflects a range of 22% to 25% for the fourth quarter.

We don't currently see a catalyst to give us comfort to accelerate our comparable sales growth in the fourth quarter at a rate faster than the third quarter given the uncertain macro environment. And second we increased sales by $10 million related to completed M&A transactions.Our fourth quarter gross margin outlook includes a range of 42.8% to 44.2% compared to 46% in the prior-year period. At the midpoint our gross margin expectations assume a decrease of 250 basis points which is consistent with our results in the third quarter. Our outlook includes continued margin headwinds related to business mix product margins and additional distribution center costs.

Our outlook also factors in continued occupancy leverage in the fourth quarter. We expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA to be $94 million to $104 million and we expect fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share to be $0.30 to $0.36. Our outlook for the fourth quarter includes interest expense of $9 million. This is approximately $2 million higher than the third quarter and the increase reflects current rates on our floating rate debt.

And finally our diluted weighted average shares outstanding does not assume any incremental share repurchases. It is important to note that we are encouraged with our preliminary July performance which is in line with our outlook. On capital allocation we have a balanced and disciplined approach and our priorities remain as follows. Our first priority is capital structure.

Our second priority is to invest in growth through both capital expenditures and M&A. In the first nine months of fiscal 2022 we deployed $41 million toward acquisitions and we invested $26 million in capital expenditures. Over the last year we've accelerated the pace of M&A and our pipeline of M&A opportunities continues to grow. Our final priority is to return excess cash to shareholders.

In the first nine months of fiscal 2022 we repurchased shares totaling $152 million and we have $148 million remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to repurchase shares based on investment opportunities to drive growth our financial position and market conditions. And with that I'll hand it back over to you Mike. Thank you.

Mike Egeck -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks Steve. I want to wrap up by saying that we acknowledge our third quarter results reflect executional challenges that we should have been able to manage better. For our organization and leadership team that will never be acceptable. With that being said we want to communicate three important points.

The first is that we understand what happened with our New Jersey DC and we have taken the actions to fix it. We have also implemented plans to improve the entirety of our supply chain and its ability to support our future growth. The second is that our year-over-year results and market share gains are evidence that the fundamental drivers of the pool industry the durable competitive advantages of the Leslie's operating model and the effectiveness of our strategic growth initiatives remain intact. The third is that we have a long and successful history of profitable growth in the face of all kinds of macroeconomic headwinds and that we are better equipped today than we have ever been to continue that success and win in the market.

With that I'll hand it back to the operator for Q&A.

Questions & Answers:

Operator

Thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question is from Peter Benedict with Baird. Please proceed with your question.

Peter Benedict -- Baird -- Analyst

Hi guys. Thanks for taking the questions. First just around the increased promotional activity Steve I think you mentioned -- or Mike that you think it's back to kind of normalized levels. But how do you -- how does that make you think about the stickiness of pricing that has lifted sales in the industry here over the last couple of years? And then the related kind of follow-up is curious about the Trichlor inventory levels across the industry.

We're seeing more promos in that area suggests that those levels are healthy at least relative to demand. So just help us understand your thoughts around the future promotions the stickiness of price and then a little color on Trichlor. Thank you.

Mike Egeck -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah Peter. Thanks for the question. Let me kind of walk through how Q3 worked. It's been pretty well documented.

I think it was a cold and wet start to the season particularly in two key markets Northeast and the West Coast. This was going on at the same time that the industry was comping the chlorine shortage news from the prior year and a relatively strong Q3 for the industry. At the same time macro pressures intensified for the consumer and what we saw was some increased price sensitivity. So you've got retailers coming off of a cold start to the season trying to comp the chlorine spike from the prior year.

They see a more price-sensitive customer. And yes we saw some more promoting in the industry in which we participated. We have a price position in the marketplace and we want to hold that price positioning. I think it's important too to make the distinction between promotions and the way we look at this is promotions are measure and our way to get our share of our industry traffic.

It's actually not related to inventory. Promotions are not distressed inventory markdowns. And to your question on Trichlor. Trichlor is in much much better supply this year than it was the prior year.

It's at elevated costs for us and for everyone else. But promotions do tend to focus on chemicals in the industry because they have broad use across the industry and because they are I would say the most effective traffic driver for us and for the industry. That being said I would characterize the level of increased promotion which across the entirety of our revenue was 120 basis points is more normalized versus the last Q3 where there was a lot of shortages of product in chemicals particularly and very very little discounting.

Peter Benedict -- Baird -- Analyst

That's helpful. I guess my follow-up Mike would be as you think about next year and the price -- just the inflation levels for Trichlor and that type of thing you've said in the past you think that those levels are unlikely to come back down. Are you rethinking that here? How should we think about Trichlor inflation and the inflation more broadly across the product portfolio for the next 12 months? Thank you.

Mike Egeck -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. I'll speak to Trichlor specifically. We still think there's a lot of cost pressure on the Trichlor across the manufacturing base particularly in North America. So we don't see what has been established as the new retail prices coming down but we would expect a more normalized promotional rate which is what we believe we saw in Q3.

I'll make the point too that Q3 is traditionally the most promotional quarter for the industry really Memorial Day through the fourth of July. And as Steve mentioned in the month of July we've got our preliminary results in that promotional level has come down. Next year I would expect Q3 to be somewhat similar. I don't think we're going to see any significant decrease in Trichlor costing.

And based on that I think the industry pricing will hold.

Peter Benedict -- Baird -- Analyst

Got it. Thanks so much.

Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.

Ryan Merkel -- William Blair -- Analyst

Hey guys. Good morning.

Mike Egeck -- Chief Executive Officer

Good morning.

Ryan Merkel -- William Blair -- Analyst

Steve you mentioned that higher product costs were going to impact the rest of the year. I think you also said uncertain supply was going to be a factor. Can you just walk us through those again? And maybe when do you think you're going to be clear of those issues?

Steve Weddell -- Chief Financial Officer

Sure. Happy to. Thanks Ryan. Yeah.

And again part of the commentary was a very mixed environment. So as we talked about some of the pressures in the Northeast in our DC we talked about elevated receipts. When you look year on year from an inventory perspective most of the inventory growth is in Trichlor as well as equipment but not all equipment some equipment. And when you think about the challenges we had kind of in-season making sure we stayed replenished across our network.

It really related to kind of non-Trichlor chemicals. And in some cases those are DSD going straight to stores other cases working through our own distribution network as well. When you have shortages and a vendor does not provide product we are going to serve our customers even if that product we procure comes from different sources and not going to be through our traditional contracts or at traditional pricing. So we're going to pay a premium to get those products into our stores on an expedited basis from vendors who we do not necessarily consolidate all of our spend with.

We really saw that happen kind of post Memorial Day. If you look at the quarter when you talk about that 115 basis points of product margin pressure I'd characterize it as most related to promotions but some product cost feels like in Q4 that as Mike just talked about promotions feel like they've moderated. Product costs will stay a little elevated as we stay in stock through the rest of the year. And so when you think about longer term and kind of working into next year and again not providing guidance today but I do think that the promotional environment if we're normalized at current levels should moderate.

In the inventory product costing we should work through over the next couple of quarters. And as we prepare for next season we will look at opportunities to ensure that we don't have similar issues as we did this year with outages.

Ryan Merkel -- William Blair -- Analyst

Got it. That's helpful. OK. And then my second question is just on the 4Q guide just so I understand it.

It sounds like you're extrapolating what you saw in 3Q. It sounds like it might be a little conservative. We have an uncertain macro. You saw in July that sounds pretty decent.

You said promotions are not getting worse. So is the right read here that underlying industry demand is not slowing down dramatically the industry outlook is still pretty good and you think the promotions or so that's behind you?

Mike Egeck -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Ryan I'll take that one. I do think you described it correctly. We were pleased to see promotions stabilize in July.

And when you look at industry demand if you -- the issue we had with our DC costs us about 700 basis points of comp in our residential business. So instead of running a 6% comp we would have run a 13% comp. So in this demand we think is very much alive and stable. The change we really saw in Q3 was as I described before given the slow start to the season and comping the chlorine shortage and media coverage from last year and a consumer that blanked a little there was some price sensitivity and the industry reacted with some promotions.

It's not typically a promotional-driven industry. We don't expect it to become one and we think we saw that recovery in July.

Ryan Merkel -- William Blair -- Analyst

Perfect. Thanks.

Our next question is from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.

Kate McShane -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. I wanted to ask quickly about some of the incremental costs that you discussed particularly around the distribution center issues.

I know some are persisting into fourth quarter. Is that mostly headcount related? And given that the situation seems to be somewhat of a backup with regards to the supply chain. Is that headcount being considered more temporary? Or is this now in the base?

Steve Weddell -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. Good question Kate and good morning. I think the right way to think about it is that for the quarter and for Q3 as well as for Q4 it is primarily payroll headcount related as we have more individuals to get the capacity that we need to serve both stores as well as digital demand. As we get into next year Mike talked about setting up a different approach particularly in a market like the Northeast where you need seven days a week double shifts third parties to kind of assist with the volume.

So I would characterize the spend as being reallocated most likely as we go forward. But again if that spend stays at current levels with the incremental demand that we did not serve this year it isn't necessarily going to be a headwind from a margin rate perspective. So I think from a dollar perspective again too early to say exact but it will be higher than previously expected going into the quarter but it will be good spend to serve incremental demand.

Kate McShane -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

OK. Thank you. And then my second question is can you talk to ticket versus traffic during the quarter in terms of how it drove the comp?

Mike Egeck -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Kate I'll answer that one. Good morning. The -- if you look just at our comp residential business transactions were down just over 1% about 1.3%.

Average order value the ticket was up about 9%. Put those together and you get to our 7% comp. And I'll note again the DC cost us about 700 basis points of comp there. So that was a big impact.

Across the total business the transaction count was plus 3% in the quarter and the average order value was 10%. Those two combined get us to our 13% sales growth.

Kate McShane -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Liz Suzuki with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.

Liz Suzuki -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Great. Thank you. Just curious how much market share you think you could have gained if you hadn't had the issues with the Northeast DC. And then what percentage of your stores does that DC serve?

Mike Egeck -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. That -- the Northeast is an outsized portion of our business in Q3 because it's a very concentrated season in the best of years and this year was more so with the slow start. And I think the way to characterize it is $35 million about 700 basis points of comp in our residential business would have increased the share we had as we show on Page 15 by that amount.

Liz Suzuki -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Great. And Thank you. I'm just curious Leslie's has obviously been around for a while company was founded in the '60s. So this wasn't the first time you've had a cold spring.

Why do you think the Northeastern DC was caught off guard by this increase in demand as the weather warmed up?

Mike Egeck -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. That's -- well that's a great question and it's a question that we've asked ourselves a lot internally. We -- the season got a late start. We were well positioned with inventory in the stores to start the season.

The start to Memorial Day weekend was I'm going to say OK a little more promotional than normal but OK. The first week of shipping -- replenishment shipping following Memorial Day weekend the DC had some issues. That's not unusual for a DC in ours. We have -- DCs have bad weeks.

They tend to get caught up. And in this case we saw the reverse and the performance deteriorated all the way through June. And it's a combination of a very tough staffing environment. And when you add people in shifts quickly to the situation to rectify it which we did you run into a lot of problems and challenges in getting the right supervisory talent to manage those additional ships.

So it was just -- it was a highly inefficient process. But to be clear we should have managed it better and we should have seen it coming. It's very disappointing internally for us not to manage that better.

Liz Suzuki -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

OK. Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Matuszewski with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.

Jonathan Matuszewski -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Great. Hey Mike. Hey Steve. Thanks for taking my question.

First one on gross margin. With the shortfall this quarter can you just help us think about the low end and the high end of the implied gross margin forecast in guidance I guess what's embedded in each of those beyond the impact of higher or lower sales? So what is your low end and high end imply in terms of maybe promotionality in the industry from here? It sounds like maybe it stabilized in July but are you planning for any incremental promotions in 4Q? Thanks.

Mike Egeck -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Good morning Jonathan. I'll take the part on promos and Steve you can talk about the building blocks of the margin. Within promotions have settled down.

We've got Labor Day weekend coming up. We expect it to be fairly normalized to next year. The second part of the product margin challenge though and Steve mentioned this earlier is some unexpected short shipments from vendors on particularly specialty chemicals. That's a very active situation.

We're managing it day-to-day. And I'll note that it's completely different than last year. Last year the shortages and supply challenges were focused on Trichlor and equipment. Trichlor inventory is in good shape.

Equipment inventory for the most part is in good shape. But things like shock liquid chlorine dry acid algicides we got short ship 30% to 40% from some of our proven vendors on those products. And to meet consumer demand we've gone to the open market to purchase and that has been -- that's come in at a much higher cost. So that pressure we see continuing into Q4 as part of the product margin.

Promotions we think will stabilize and become less of a factor.

Steve Weddell -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes. And Jonathan with respect to the margin rate change in Q4 kind of midpoint implied 250-basis-point decline which is consistent with Q3. Again I had made a comment that a little bit different mix as we think about how it will play out in Q4 from our perspective a little more business mix impact in Q4 given some of the M&A and the strength of the hot tub business in Q4 relative to Q3. And then when you think about what Mike just kind of walked through promotionally feel like it's a little less impactful but still higher than last year.

And in product -- margin related to product cost is really dependent on our ability to get the incremental product from existing vendors. So partially why we have the range we have is the uncertainty of when or if we get to replenish from some of those existing vendors or if we have to rely on our new found partners existing or new relationships to drive more product into the network.

Jonathan Matuszewski -- Jefferies -- Analyst

That's helpful. And then my follow-up question. Just in terms of the customer mix it looks like PRO percent of residential [inaudible]. Curious whether you're seeing any indications of homeowners looking to engage more in DIY maintenance of their pools as maybe they tighten their house expenditure.

Are you hearing that from store associates PRO partners anything like that presumably work to your advantage?

Mike Egeck -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah Jonathan. I would say that in past macroeconomic slowdowns there has been an uptick in DIY pool maintenance from residential consumers. I believe we would have seen that this quarter without the challenges associated with the New Jersey DC. On the PRO side we haven't really seen any slowdown in that business.

We're a much smaller player in that business to the total. So we've got lots of room to grow. And that business was all very positive. I think the only challenge we had there was similar to what Steve was mentioning.

We did have some periodic shortages of supply trying to service the PRO business. But outside of that we're very pleased with how the affiliate program is working in the PRO initiative overall.

Jonathan Matuszewski -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Carter with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.

Andrew Carter -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst

Sorry I was mute. Just want to make sure -- and because I'm a little confused here. So early June the commentary was adverse weather which you alluded to in the late start. You then suggested that would have been a neutral-to-positive impact.

So to be clear if I understand this correctly the DC issue didn't allow you to fully capitalize on the favorability. And kind of to that end would you have known that there were kind of issues with this DC if there wasn't a kind of a change in the end market demand that was that abrupt? And finally I'll just ask kind of all in one. I appreciate your viewing the remainder of the network but how can you kind of assess this risk at other locations? And could there be any stepped-up investment SG&A capex whatever next year to fix any other efficiencies? Thanks.

Mike Egeck -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah Andrew. Thanks for the question. The -- when we were at the first week of June speaking to investors like I'd said earlier we'd come to Memorial Day weekend. It was slow but not terrible.

It was more promotional. But we had a lot of momentum in the business. The Northeast region in particular was outperforming at that time the rest of our store fleet. And the situation with the DC started when they had trouble fulfilling the replenishment shipments into the stores they serve that first week of June.

And like I've said before and we've seen not unusual for one of our DCs to have a poor week of shipping. So we were concerned but not overly concerned. The challenge was there wasn't a recovery from that and the situation got worse and worse for several weeks. So caught us by surprise should not have caught us by surprise should have been able to manage through it better.

And as you can see in the results it was a big hit to the quarter. In regards to the DCs we will have grown in the last two years 60-plus percent. We've invested in our DCs. We need to continue to invest in our DCs.

And the situation with New Jersey has put us on high alert from a learning perspective in evaluating the balance of our network. That's for sure.

Steve Weddell -- Chief Financial Officer

And Andrew this is Steve. I think the other thing to think about in the Northeast it does have the most acute change even with a normalized cadence as you go from kind of Q2 to Q3 really kind of peaking into end of May early June from a volume perspective. So you don't have the same acute volume changes at other facilities. But as Mike said we've certainly seen those facilities operate well and they may have a day or two or a week where there's challenges but kind of pick themselves back up and continue to operate in that as normal.

So as Mike said we've talked a lot about investments in distribution and supply chain. It's part of what we've been talking about all year from an investment perspective as well and given the pace of growth and the fact that we continue to have kind of six full-line distribution centers across our network even with the elevated sales volume it is an opportunity for us to revisit efficiencies and opportunities to supplement in season.

Andrew Carter -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst

Our next question is from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.

Peter Keith -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst

Hi. Thanks. Good morning everyone. Just wanted to get clarity on the sales outlook for the fourth quarter.

I believe you said you've reduced your prior outlook by $21 million. But at the same time it sounds like the DC issue is now resolved. You also -- you did comment on macroeconomic challenges which obviously we're aware of. But at the same time you've talked in the past about 80% of the business being nondiscretionary.

So just help me understand a little bit better about that reduced sales outlook. And is there something we should be concerned about going forward?

Steve Weddell -- Chief Financial Officer

Hey good question. Go ahead Mike.

Mike Egeck -- Chief Executive Officer

Go ahead.

Steve Weddell -- Chief Financial Officer

Good morning Keith. Yeah. From an outlook perspective we're looking at a basic growth of 13% to 18% comp of kind of 6% to 9%. If you think about Q3 where we were at 7% basically midpoint of that outlook is consistent with Q3.

As you pointed out DC is behind us in the Northeast and kind of shipping to plan which is good. But again given the macroeconomic uncertainty it doesn't feel like now is the right time to basically accelerate the pace of expectations in Q4. We're pleased with July as we talked about. But I think at this point folks were comfortable with our current outlook which overall for the year is 15% to 17% top-line growth in comp of call it 9% to 11%.

Peter Keith -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst

OK. And if I just look at the Q4 gross margin so I think you also said at the midpoint you're down 250.So it's down a similar amount as Q3. But at the same time the promos are abating. Are you just trying to give yourself some cover here on the promos and then this mix issue with the elevated product cost? Because it seems like the gross margins sequentially should have less pressure.

Steve Weddell -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. It's different pressure. So I talked about likely more business mix headwind in Q4 promotions less headwind and product costs more headwind is probably the right way to think about it. But it feels like consistent with last quarter is the right place to be at the midpoint.

Peter Keith -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst

OK. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.

Michael Kessler -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Great. Hey guys. This is Michael Kessler on for Simeon. Thanks for taking our questions.

First I was hoping you could maybe help distinguish a bit more I guess between the challenges that you had in New Jersey DC which had weather issues the supply chain moderating at the same time coming in relative I guess to other regions. Were there also shipment issues from vendors like across the country more widespread? And then relatedly can you speak to just the Northeast region sales performance relative to the rest of the country and also versus your plan?

Mike Egeck -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah sure. The combination of a late start to the season combined with a really significant peak in receiving from vendors impacted all of the DCs. And it wasn't expected but we were able to manage through it in all but the New Jersey DC. So there was a similar pressures I would say across our network amplified in New Jersey with -- as Steve has explained a very strong peak in that region in terms of replenishment season happens very quickly there.

And with a slow start it concentrated demand. And at the same time we had -- it seems like most of the vendors caught up at the same time in the supply chain and we took on those receipts but it made for a very crowded any problematic challenge particularly in the New Jersey DC. The Northeast region we don't really break out comps and performance and size by region. But it was the only region in our network of seven regions that had a negative comp.

And that was very specifically the impact of the DC that serves that region.

Michael Kessler -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Got it. OK. That's helpful. A follow-up just on margins and starting to turn the page a little bit to next year thinking about normalized margins for the business.

So there's some moving pieces now with maybe potentially some costs in DCs. You have the mix shift as the [inaudible] used to grow maybe promotions have to be annualized at a lower rate. So can you talk about I guess where do you see that all normalizing in any -- I guess on the other side offset in -- from a tailwind standpoint just as we're trying to kind of calibrate where margins are going off of this year than relative to where you were at pre-COVID.

Steve Weddell -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah good question.

Mike Egeck -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Go ahead.

Steve Weddell -- Chief Financial Officer

I'll take this Mike. We're not providing guidance for 2023 today and we're not changing our long-term growth algorithm either. So when you think about and step back longer term the aftermarket pool industry fundamentals remain intact. But when you think about our algorithm and how we talked about it we have business mix headwinds.

It's been there since we went public. It will continue to be as we develop relationships with new consumers and new channels. We generally drive product margins higher in each of our businesses. We do that through our director vendor relationships which is unique in the industry relative to most of the competition.

Our proprietary brand strategies we've talked about our ability to continue to expand in that area. And then again our vertical integration around distribution and manufacturing. So those should provide efficiencies and leverage across the business kind of year over the long term. And then again expect continued occupancy leverage.

So those are kind of the core drivers that continue to -- we think are going to continue to drive gross margin in the future. I think we do have some noise over the next few quarters and we look forward to providing guidance as we get through Q4.

Mike Egeck -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. The only thing I would add is with a stabilized supply situation and that's getting better though Steve described and it's still mixed and a stabilized promotion situation which will be reset more normalized. And I think we've seen that happen in the fourth quarter. We can manage margins.

We can manage margins to our long-term growth algorithm. We got surprised by some factors in this quarter and that really led to the product margin degradation that you saw.

Michael Kessler -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Our next question is from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Please proceed with your question.

Garik Shmois -- Loop Capital Markets -- Analyst

Oh hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just wondering how you're viewing some of your growth initiatives the pace of the PRO conversion acquisitions new store openings just given the more uncertain macro.

Mike Egeck -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Garik I would say we feel very good about the PRO initiative. Like I said comp 17% for the quarter would have been higher without some periodic shortages of product particularly larger sizes of shock. So feeling very confident there.

On the M&A side we continue to see lots of opportunities. We're going to look to accelerate that. The residential stores that we are opening new stores are performing well as is our marketing -- digital marketing efforts to underserved areas. We had talked about the file growth starting to moderate.

You saw that this quarter. I also point out that this year was a very unusual year between the Texas freeze which impacted the entire industry and the chlorine -- the media coverage of the chlorine shortage last year two really extraordinary events that put a lot of noise in the year with regard to consumer acquisition. But if you look at our two-year stacks in the quarter plus 14 we feel good about that and plus 16 for the year. So bumpy ride on the consumer file growth but believe with those events behind us we'll get back to a steady growth in the file at a lower level.

We've said 100 to 300 basis points. I think that's where you'll see us next year.

Garik Shmois -- Loop Capital Markets -- Analyst

Got it. Just wanted to follow up one more time on the New Jersey DC. I think you mentioned you're shifting to a seven day a week to shift a day model. I'm just kind of curious how does that compare to before? And how universal is that model across your network?

Mike Egeck -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Well that's the model we're going to put in place across the network. We had an acute problem with a New Jersey DC but we were running all of our DCs right at max capacity for the season. Seven day a week with a large e-commerce business like we have I'm going to say is the norm.

We're currently operating about 5.5 to six days a week. We had run second shifts in most of the DCs over the course of the season. However it was not a seven day a week. And the challenge here is really you can add temporary DC staff and you can train them up for a season.

What we learned this season is the challenge is really around supervision and we're going to make the investment in second shift and weekend shift supervision that will just put in place in the DCs year-round. And then they will -- they will really have their specific tasks during season.

Garik Shmois -- Loop Capital Markets -- Analyst

Thank you. Our final question today comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory. Please proceed with your question. The next question is from Dana Telsey.

Your line is live for questions.

Dana Telsey -- Telsey Advisory Group -- Analyst

Hi everyone. As you think about inventory levels given what happened in the New Jersey DC should we be seeing inventory levels perhaps at the end of the fourth quarter? And then the changes in product procurement that you mentioned Mike how much of that continues going forward? And how much of the New Jersey DC costs can continue or sticky and that's the way the business continues to operate? And how much is permanent versus how much is variable? Thank you.

Steve Weddell -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. Good morning Dana. I'll take the first part of that on inventory. As we think about year end I'm not going to guide to specific numbers but we expect inventory to remain elevated.

Again the two primary areas of increase year on year for Q3 were Trichlor and equipment. On Trichlor the increase is relative to last year which was more depressed more difficult to come by. And so we're in a much better position from a Trichlor perspective across our network both -- all stages raw materials produced goods in our DCs and in our stores. When you think of equipment the equipment is where we've had a lot of the uncertainty around timing of receipt.

And it does feel like that area of the supply chain is moderating. It is getting better. It has resulted in elevated levels. When you think about the nature of our inventory it doesn't have the same level of obsolescence as many other retailers.

This is a good product. And if the choice is to take inventory at a little bit higher level today going into the end of the year and to start off next year in a better position versus try to run leaner. We will take the former in the current environment. So it's something we expect to actively manage in the year end and through next year don't necessarily view these levels as permanent increases.

But in the current environment it's the appropriate level of inventory.

Mike Egeck -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Good morning Dana. I apologize. I had some trouble hearing the second part of the question.

I believe it was around how much of the DC -- the elevated expense in the DC would be permanent. The way I would answer that is the DCs will be more expensive to operate on a go-forward basis but it will also give us the increased capacity we need and we should be able to gain leverage on the DC expense as it goes up just through our standard growth profile.

What is a Fixed Income Investment?

What Benefits Does Fixed Income Offer in a Portfolio?

Investing in Fixed Income: ASX and US ETFs

The Role of Gold During the Investment Cycle





With the stock market and cryptocurrency both well off their highs as central banks hike interest rates in response to inflation investors would be wise to pay attention to the holdings in their portfolios.

Please consult a financial adviser your tax accountant and the PDS to decide if any products mentioned here or elsewhere are right for you.

What is a Fixed Income Investment?

Fixed income refers to a group of investments that typically pay investors fixed levels of interest at regular intervals until a future date in time known as the maturity' date.

Upon maturity investors generally receive their original investment back which is otherwise known as the principal' or face' value.

Arguably the most understood type of fixed income investing is a term deposit. You generate interest on a regular basis and at the end of the term you may withdraw your original deposit and associated earnings.

However bonds are one of the most popular choices of fixed income investments that provide investors with regular income called coupon payments'. Quite often experienced investors automatically associate fixed income investments with bonds.

A bond is a type of debt package' that consists of loans made to an entity issuing the bond. Companies and governments issue bonds to borrow money. This type of investment has grown rapidly with funds under management (FUM) for Australian bond ETFs increasing tenfold since 2015.

Other types of fixed income products include hybrids certificates of deposit floating rate notes and money market funds.

Learn more about investing in hybrid securities here.





What Benefits Does Fixed Income Offer in a Portfolio?

Fixed income is another type of investment strategy that you may choose to leverage during uncertain market conditions. Just like investors may consider share investing for growth or dividend income fixed income is designed to provide an option for investors who might be looking for a more defensive and stable form of investment that provides regular cash flow.

Fixed income may serve an integral role in an investor portfolio especially as a balance against other investments during a downturn in the investment cycle.

Some of the potential benefits of investing in fixed income include:

Diversification: fixed income investments are generally less volatile and less risky than shares during uncertain macroeconomic conditions and they may even act as a hedge against a falling share market to deliver a balanced portfolio. Dependable income: fixed income generally offers a steady and reliable source of cash flow that may smooth out portfolio returns. Preserve capital: bonds are usually more defensive than stocks and therefore less volatile owing to the fact they offer greater visibility in terms of stated objectives namely to return the principal amount to the investor and to offer yield until maturity. Risk-averse investing: investors approaching retirement may benefit from an asset that is generally considered less risky and more stable than shares but younger investors also stand to benefit from fixed income where the market outlook is uncertain and one portfolio is already exposed to excessive investment risk.

Investing in Fixed Income: ASX and US ETFs

One of the risks of fixed income is a lack of liquidity in the bond market. While an investor can readily buy a bond sellers sometimes find it difficult to dispose of a fixed income asset. What more transaction fees pricing transparency and minimum investment criteria are hurdles.

However ETFs make it easier for investors to buy and sell fixed income assets overcoming the liquidity issue and other barriers associated with direct investments in fixed income assets.

If you're new to ETFs read our beginner guide here.

There are a number of exchange-traded products across both the ASX and US stock markets that offer investors exposure to fixed income. By and large the majority of these products hold a basket of bonds.

In some cases these are government bonds issued by countries around the world with different sovereign credit ratings. These bonds are often favoured during a stock market correction to hedge a portfolio against market losses.

In other cases it may be corporate bonds issued by companies of different investment-grade quality. There are varying levels of risk as a company could in theory default on its loans and the full value of the principal payment may not be received.

Generally speaking bonds with a better credit profile and shorter duration (i.e. less sensitive to interest rates) tend to hold up better during a market downturn. On the contrary bonds with a poor credit rating are more susceptible to price weakness albeit offer higher yields.

There are also a selection of funds targeting cash or hybrids a type of investment that combines equity and debt-like features.





The Role of Gold During the Investment Cycle

While fixed income may have distinct advantages during a market downturn there are also risks tied to inflation and interest rates.

As fixed income products provide a fixed payment on a regular basis yield needs to outpace inflation otherwise real returns are negative. Inflation-linked bonds are one option but this means a smaller choice of ETFs.

Normally rising interest rates would also put pressure on bond prices. However if the market believes the terminal (i.e. final) value of interest rates may not be as high as originally expected bond prices can rally.

These considerations may give rise to another investment option when inflation is high and interest rates are rising - investing in gold.

Given its scarcity and its status as a safe haven' asset the precious metal is typically viewed as a hedge against inflation. This is because demand for the commodity tends to increase during periods of uncertainty where investors either look to preserve their capital or outpace inflation.

Over the long term the price of gold has increased nearly 500% since the year 2000.

As part of an investment portfolio gold as well as other precious metals can provide balance through the downturn of an investment cycle. The potential benefits of investing in gold include diversification reduced risk exposure and lower portfolio volatility.

A number of ASX and US ETFs on the Selfwealth platform allow investors to invest in gold.

Fixed Income and Gold in a Portfolio

As investors move through the investment cycle it may be prudent to consider alternative asset classes as part of a diversified portfolio. ETFs help investors overcome the barriers associated with investing directly in these assets. For just $9.50 flat-fee per trade you can invest in fixed income and gold ETFs through the Selfwealth platform and look to immediately balance the market cycle.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWFnZS5jb20uYXUvbmF0aW9uYWwvdmljdG9yaWEvc3Vja2VkLWRyeS1ob3ctYS1wcml2YXRlLXNjaG9vbC1mZWxsLWludG8tZmluYW5jaWFsLXJ1aW4tMjAyMjA4MDQtcDViN2JqLmh0bWzSAXlodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVhZ2UuY29tLmF1L25hdGlvbmFsL3ZpY3RvcmlhL3N1Y2tlZC1kcnktaG93LWEtcHJpdmF0ZS1zY2hvb2wtZmVsbC1pbnRvLWZpbmFuY2lhbC1ydWluLTIwMjIwODA0LXA1Yjdiai5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Sucked dry’: How a private school fell into financial ruin,"Wittmer defended the annual payments of $520000 as fair recompense for capital he provided to the school in its early years. The recently renamed Colmont School was last week placed into administration and declared insolvent. Credit: Jason South “I had hocked myself to the hilt and thrown a lifetime of business at the highest level into it” he said. He declined to disclose the 2019 sale price but said the property holdings alone were worth $25 million. The Chinese company that bought the Kilmore school assets operates a school in the island province of Hainan and another in central China. Its spokesman Locke Wang said the company wanted the school to be successful and had planned to redevelop part of the Kilmore site into a Timbertop-style campus to immerse overseas students in Australian culture. “Regrettably such a plan did not attract genuine engagement from the school board” he said. The company’s two local directors are a husband-and-wife team Chien-long Tai and Yuyu Chen. Tai said an offer of rent relief and a proposed bailout involving unidentified investors had been rejected by the administrators.

Administrator Paul Langdon from Vince & Associates told a creditors’ meeting on Friday that no restructuring plan had been put or any additional funding offered that would allow the school to stay open. The creditors who are mostly parents and teachers from the school owed fees and unpaid entitlements voted to dump the Vince & Associates team and appoint new administrators – Rachel Burdett and Bruno Secatore from the firm Cor Cordis – to explore the Chinese company’s proposal to reopen the school. Former school directors told The Age this week that Steven Scroggie the business manager for the Kilmore International School between 2016 and 2020 delved into the school’s contractual history with Wittmer and raised concerns with the school about what he found. It is understood that Scroggie told school board members in the months leading up to the pandemic that despite its strong run of cash-positive years the school was facing three years of financial losses. He urged the school to disentangle itself from its long-term licensing contracts and leases wind up the Kilmore International School and rebrand under a new name.

Loading For his troubles Scroggie was sacked and escorted off the school premises in February 2020. He declined to comment when contacted by The Age but his advice to the board proved prescient. In the two years since he left the school has posted losses totalling $5 million and no longer has enough money to meet its operating costs. As the COVID-19 pandemic hit Australia’s borders shut and an exodus of international students smashed a $6 million hole in the school’s revenue. School chairman Rod Dally and principal Peter Cooper severed the school’s international marketing and licensing obligations and explored the possibility of relocating the school to a proposed new development site in the nearby town of Wallan. Half of the board’s six directors quit at the start of this year. A former director said the board became divided and dysfunctional meetings were increasingly haphazard and that it was difficult to obtain financial information.

Loading “It went to a culture where there was a lack of transparency and basic culture” they said. Under a corporate structure devised by Wittmer the land buildings and intellectual property of the school were housed within companies he controlled and a separate company was established with no assets to govern the operations of the school. In addition to the licensing fee the school paid up to $1.75 million in rent and a fixed $1.6 million fee for international marketing services to the Wittmer companies. The international marketing services included the travel costs for overseas agents translation services and pastoral care of students. Wittmer said a business consultancy engaged by the school Verve Advisory examined the international marketing and student services his company provided to the school and concluded they represented value for money. The author of the report did not reply to questions from The Age.

The 2020 whistleblower complaint painted a different picture. It claimed that the school paid $180000 rent to Wittmer for an abandoned Catholic primary school site that was never used by Kilmore for classes and at one point paid him a salary of $70000 to be a member of the school’s maintenance staff. The whistleblower was critical of the school board for allowing the arrangements to continue. “Unless the business model is changed I believe the school will become insolvent” the whistleblower warned. “It is in my opinion that the board of this school places more value on protecting the income stream of RW than acting in the best interests of the school.” A school insider put it more succinctly. “It got sucked dry” he said. The demise of the 32-year-old school has rekindled a bitter feud between Wittmer his supporters and his detractors.

Loading A board-supported plan to shift the school away from Kilmore provoked allegations of conflict of interest against Walter Mott a former school director. Mott is a director of the Crystal Group a property development company involved in the creation of St Hilaire a new town planned on the southern boundary of Wallan that will eventually be home to 180000 people. During Mott’s time on the board the school registered St Hilaire International Grammar School as a business name. Hilaire is Walter Mott’s middle name. Mott’s daughter Celina Mott also a director of the Crystal Group said her father stood down from the board to avoid a conflict of interest once it became clear the school was considering potential sites in the St Hilaire development. The school has since been renamed the Colmont School.",,,,,,

Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.

Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

As a computer pumps an orchestral score through strategically placed speakers he turns to address a scattered crowd.

“For the past six months my family and I have borne witness to an absolute spectacle” he announces emphasizing “spectacle.” A former child star Ricky “Jupe” Park (Steven Yeun) gained notoriety from a hit sitcom. Now the proprietor of Jupiter’s Claim a western-themed amusement park in the California wilderness Park can only gesture toward the success he once enjoyed. But with his latest show dubbed the “Star Lasso Experience” Jupe hopes he’ll make it back to the big time.

With the exception of the movie’s oft-exclaimed title “spectacle” might be the most frequently used word in Nope.

What follows Jupe’s speech is one of the most memorable sequences in Nope the latest thriller from writer and director Jordan Peele. With unflinching dexterity Peele and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema juxtapose the terror of encountering a being from beyond with one of the most claustrophobic scenes ever caught on film. It’s a spectacle but not the type that Jupe had in mind.

With the exception of the movie’s oft-exclaimed title “spectacle” might be the most frequently used word in Nope. From the opening Biblical epigraph from Nahum 3:6 (“I will pelt you with filth I will treat you with contempt and make you a spectacle”) to the comments hurled at protagonists O.J. (Daniel Kaluuya) and Emerald “Em” Haywood (Keke Palmer) Nope is deeply concerned with dissecting the nature of making a scene.

While Nope directly references Steven Spielberg classics Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind it also draws on many of the ideas in French media theorist Guy Debord’s 1967 work The Society of the Spectacle. Written as a collection of aphorisms The Society of the Spectacle analyzes the relationship between representation and society under late capitalism.

“In societies where modern conditions of production prevail all of life presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles” Debord declares in the first aphorism. Driven by a relentless need for something new and a desire to turn people away from reality spectacles become the new primary form of social cohesion. “The spectacle is not a collection of images but a social relation among people mediated by images” argues Debord.

Dazzling images and our dependence on them drive Nope primarily in the relationship between O.J. and Em.

The siblings inherited their father’s company Haywood Hollywood Horses after his unexplained death.

As Em explains to uninterested Hollywood execs after a failed commercial shoot with one of their horses they are descendents of the Bahamian jockey featured in the first moving picture “The Horse in Motion.” Though history remembers the photographer Eadweard Muybridge the man on the horse goes unnamed and uncredited much like O.J. and Em’s efforts to preserve his legacy.

While the taciturn O.J. loves working with the horses he lacks the social skills to keep the ranch afloat especially as the entertainment industry pivots from living animals to CGI recreations. Em his outgoing younger sister knows how to lay on the charm but the preferential treatment her father showed O.J. leaves her feeling excluded from the business.

When what seems to be a UFO hovers above the Haywood Ranch and its neighbor Jupiter’s Claim O.J. and Em think they’ve found an answer to their woes. With the sometimes-unsolicited help of tech-savvy Angel (Brandon Perea) and that of temperamental cinematographer Antlers Holst (Michael Wincott) the Haywoods risk their lives to capture the spectacle on film and cash in.

Like with Chris Washington (Kaluuya) in his breakout Get Out or the upper-class Wilsons in his follow-up Us Peele never condemns his characters for living within systems of inequality. Rather he gives them room to challenge the economic conditions that make them chase spectacle—even as he refuses to turn away from the resulting destruction.

_____________________________________________________________________________

No one would call this quartet any type of real society. O.J. and Em have their shared history and genuine sibling love for each other but neither seems all that pleased to know Angel. And Holst condescends to them coming to their aid only in his ego-driven efforts to get “the perfect shot. They come together solely for the spectacle called by the sight of the phenomena’s effects and held together by the promise of riches and esteem.

For Debord these types of mercenary relationships are all that’s left under capitalism. “The spectacle subjugates living men to itself to the extent that the economy has totally subjugated them” he writes. Under this subjection authentic relationships fall away. There is no reality to ground connections not even the reality of shared trauma.

That’s most clear in the movie’s striking subplot involving Gordy’s Home the late 90s sitcom starring Jupe and a trained chimpanzee. Peele laces flashbacks to the show throughout the movie eventually revealing an incident in which a popped balloon upset the chimp playing Gordy sending him on a rampage. While the chimp attacked the other actors brutally maiming and disfiguring at least one of them young Jupe survived.

As an adult Jupe has buried his trauma with fond memories of the fame the attack granted him. When Em asks Jupe about the incident he wistfully recalls not the actual attack but a Saturday Night Live parody of the horrific incident. When he prepares to launch his Star Lasso Experience Jupe invites his maimed co-star to the premier showing no regard for her suffering.

In Debord’s formulation the spectacle is all-consuming something that can only be disrupted through radical acts of disruption.

With its classic sci-fi premise Nope repeatedly frames spectacle as danger. Characters sacrifice their lives in pursuit of something bigger than themselves an overwhelming sight and the dreams it can bring to life. But as Peele himself explains Nope is itself an act of meta-spectacle a Hollywood blockbuster that skillfully deploys striking IMAX imagery and a moving score from composer Michael Abels. The director knows how to wring responses from his audience whether horror at an apparent alien invasion or chuckles at Em’s motor-mouthed commentary.

For Debord such a response cannot be a surprise: When analyzing the spectacle “one speaks to some extent the language of the spectacular itself in the sense that one moves through the methodological terrain of the very society which expresses itself in the spectacle.”

In Debord’s formulation the spectacle is all-consuming something that can only be disrupted through radical acts of disruption.

While fans theorized the title was an acronym for “Not Of Planet Earth” Peele admitted a quotidian inspiration: it’s what people watching the movie shout at the screen. In the tradition of classical theater and especially horror cinema Nope shows viewers images that will bring them together in moments of panic or humor. The catharsis comes not from any resolution on the screen but in the way viewers reject characters’ destructive actions.

Nope may be a spectacle a Hollywood blockbuster designed to thrill and sell movie tickets. But is it a distraction that draws viewers away from reality severing the ties and connections that would allow them to think critically and reject the economic systems that seek to undo them?

The answer is right there in the title.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUuY29tL2dlbmRlci1kaXNjcmltaW5hdGlvbi93aXRoLWthbnNhcy1vbi1teS1taW5k0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With Kansas on My Mind,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.laprogressive.com/gender-discrimination/with-kansas-on-my-mind on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUuY29tL2dlbmRlci1kaXNjcmltaW5hdGlvbi93aXRoLWthbnNhcy1vbi1teS1taW5k0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdGl6ZW4tdGltZXMuY29tL3N0b3J5L29waW5pb24vMjAyMi8wOC8wNy9vcGluaW9uLXdoby1jYXVzZS1pbmZsYXRpb24tcmljaC1wb3dlcmZ1bC1oYWxmLzEwMjI2Mzk3MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion: Who is the cause of inflation? Rich powerful or the half?,"Chuck Kelly

OPINION COLUMNIST

Pundits are debating whether the U.S. is going to have a mild or a serious recession. That’s not our biggest concern today. Millions of Americans are already in a depression and at a time when billionaires and multimillionaires are proliferating and getting wealthier.

Those who lost jobs and incomes during the pandemic now find that they can no longer afford to pay the increasing rents in the cities they live in. Others have lost the homes for which they can no longer pay the mortgages. Potential new buyers can’t afford the rapidly increasing cost of a house and higher mortgage rates.

How did that happen and how are we going to change it? It’s all about the causes and results of two kinds of inflation. Are the rich and powerful causing inflation or are farmers workers small businesses the middle class and poor causing it? Or some combination of the two?

The classic illustrative case is today’s housing market. Billionaires millionaires and investment groups get wealthier when they pay cash to buy parts of neighborhoods. The housing supply dwindles demand increases and prices go up for everyone.

Donald Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is an example of what Congress should not do. It had an especially bad inflationary effect during a pandemic. It gave huge tax cuts for corporations and the rich and small token tax cuts for workers. Those whose incomes weren’t high enough to pay taxes got no benefits. Those on the lower end of the economic scale were and still are the ones most devastated by inflation.

Wealthy people increase their inflationary impact when Congress cuts their taxes. On the other hand raising progressive taxes on them reduces it like it did between 1933 and 1980 when our nation created the greatest middle class in history. We had the highest progressive taxes on corporations incomes and inheritances. We even had an excess corporate profits tax during WWII.

The Supreme Court also made conditions worse when it overturned Roe vs. Wade. It eliminated federal protections of abortion rights which hurt women who already had trouble supporting their families and could no longer limit their size via abortion. Also as we’re seeing repeatedly doctors in many states can't perform abortions they feel are necessary to protect a woman’s future health and even her life itself. It’s hard to imagine a more depressing situation not only for the women with serious pregnancy problems but also for the medical staff who want to do what’s best for them.

When the Fed raises interest rates it makes it harder on farmers small businesses workers the middle class and poor. They are the ones who have to borrow money to buy what they need.

Raising interest rates also does nothing to stop today’s biggest cause of inflation: rising costs in all countries due to the war in Ukraine the pandemic supply chain failures and climate change. Fortunately international inflation isn’t as bad for the U.S. as it is for other countries.

When the Fed raises the interest rates it doesn’t reduce the major cause of nationally caused inflation. Billionaires and millionaires don’t have to borrow the money they need to buy what they want. They pay cash for houses to rent to those who are already struggling to make ends meet.

Our economy’s greatest problem is the rapidly increasing disparity in wealth and income at all levels. Spending by upper levels always increases inflation for those at lower levels. Billionaires are pricing mere millionaires out of the markets for chateaus in France castles in England mega-yachts with helicopter pads and joy rides to outer space.

Even everyday consumers who are financially comfortable enough to buy what they want decrease the supply of products and services available to those who have to borrow money to buy what they must have.

Those who still have decent incomes and saved money during the pandemic are not in a recession yet. But the number of those who can’t buy some of the things they need—for housing food medicines and so on — is rapidly increasing.

For them that’s a depression.

More from a press release issued by American Flat Track (AFT):

Rush Brunner Take First Wins of ‘22 in Black Hills Half-Mile

DAYTONA BEACH Fla. (August 6 2022) – Progressive American Flat Track saw a pair of undercard stars recapture their past glory in Saturday evening’s Progressive Black Hills Half-Mile presented by Saddlemen at Black Hills Speedway in Rapid City South Dakota.

But even the world’s fastest riders were unable to outrace the rain which brought the Mission SuperTwins presented by S&S Cycle Main Event to a conclusion just moments after it started.

Mission Production Twins presented by Vance & Hines

Despite still riding at less than 100% Mikey Rush (No. 15 Helipower Racing/Las Vegas Harley-Davidson XG750R) achieved a huge milestone in his comeback following last year’s season-ending injury by taking his first-career Mission Production Twins presented by Vance & Hines victory.

Already a race winner in Progressive AFT’s other two classes Rush completed the hat trick after tracking down and overhauling Mission Production Twins title rivals Jesse Janisch (No. 33 Vance & Hines Harley-Davidson XG750R) and Cory Texter (No. 1 G&G Racing/Yamaha Racing Yamaha MT-07).

Those two had been widely expected to settle tonight’s winner between themselves a notion seemingly confirmed when they battled back and forth at the front during the race’s opening stages.

Instead Rush executed a quick charge up to third before slotting past Texter for second at mid-distance. He pulled the same trick on Janisch 30 seconds later and just as quickly left the two in his wake.

“I never doubted myself” said an emotional Rush. “It’s been a rough road coming off the couch and getting back to what I love doing. These guys rode a hell of a race and I knew we had our work cut out for us.

“Just a big shout out to my team. I couldn’t do it without the Helipower Racing/Las Vegas Harley-Davidson team. My crew works their tail off and it’s an honor to ride these bikes.”

Despite missing out on the win it still proved to be a positive night for Texter when considering the bigger picture. Aided by an assist from Nick Armstrong (No. 60 Competitive Racing Frames/Lessley Brothers Yamaha MT-07) who knocked Janisch off the podium altogether with a last-gasp move to claim his first podium since April’s I-70 Half-Mile runner-up Texter managed to reduce Janisch’s title lead down from eleven points to six (214-208).

While it’s more than a little strong to call the result a disaster for Janisch it was still a disappointment after he had managed to sweep the evening’s practice qualifying and Semi sessions – just as he had in his prior two victories – until finishing fourth in the Main.

Semi winner Michael Hill (No. 47 Pacific Auto Trim/Jim Speer Yamaha MT-07) enjoyed the best result of his professional career by completing the race’s top five.

Parts Unlimited AFT Singles presented by KICKER

Trevor Brunner (No. 21 Estenson Racing Yamaha YZ450F) finally brought an end to the season-long stranglehold of the top step on the podium by the combined efforts of the factory KTM and American Honda squads thanks to a tenacious performance in the night’s Parts Unlimited AFT Singles presented by KICKER Main Event.

Brunner seized the early lead and controlled the race’s opening half but still found himself in need of a late strike after earlier losing the position to an on-form Morgen Mischler (No. 13 American Honda/Progressive Insurance CRF450R).

In fact for a time second-ranked Mischler appeared well positioned to make huge inroads in what had become a hefty title deficit. The Wisconsin native darted past both Brunner and teammate Chase Saathoff (No. 106 American Honda/Progressive Insurance CRF450R) to take point and had a third win of the season in his sights while championship leader Kody Kopp (No. 12 Red Bull KTM Factory Racing 450 SX-FFE) languished down near the bottom of the top ten.

However Brunner had other ideas drawing back up on the rear of Mischler’s machine and ultimately diving underneath him to reclaim the lead with just ten seconds remaining on the clock. Brunner then cemented the win with a perfect execution of the final two laps to score his first victory since being drafted into the Estenson Racing Yamaha team at the start of the season to fill the seat left vacant due to the premier-class graduation of two-time Parts Unlimited AFT Singles champion Dallas Daniels.

Afterward Brunner said “After Mischler got by me I just tried to stay cool calm and collected behind him. I tried to figure out what he was doing that was faster than what I was doing. I kind of figured that out and got close enough where it just became a matter of what I could do to pass him and where I could do it. Fortunately I got under him entering one of the turns and never looked back.

“I can’t thank my whole team enough for all the support and all the hard work they’ve put in for me.”

Trent Lowe (No. 48 Mission Foods/Al Lamb’s Dallas Honda CRF450R) picked up his third podium finish of the season after out-dueling ‘19 class champ Dalton Gauthier (No. 79 American Honda/Progressive Insurance CRF450R) in their tussle for the final spot on the box.

Meanwhile Mischler’s hopes to make major waves were further deflated after Saathoff encountered difficulties and lost several positions including one to Kopp who ultimately fought all the way back up to fifth at the checkered flag.

As a result Kopp remains firmly in control of the title chase – even if he no longer seems quite as invincible as he did a few weeks back – leading Mischler by a still mammoth 44 points (234-190).

Progressive American Flat Track saw a pair of undercard stars recapture their past glory in Saturday evening’s Progressive Black Hills Half-Mile presented by Saddlemen at Black Hills Speedway in Rapid City South Dakota.

Some racing did take place at a rain-plagued Black Hills Half-Mile.

But even the world’s fastest riders were unable to outrace the rain which brought the Mission SuperTwins presented by S&S Cycle Main Event to a conclusion just moments after it started.

The stage was set for what promised to be an intriguing final battle before the skies opened forcing the race to be red flagged. Continued inclement weather ultimately led to the round being called complete. By rule with the Main Event’s starting positions decided but less than two laps completed every rider on the grid was awarded one point and “Rain Pay” (which divides 50% of the posted purse equally among all riders who earned starting positions) for their day’s work.

Capturing and storing carbon dioxide in underground wells has the potential to become the most consequential technological deployment in the history of the broader biofuels industry. Deploying effective carbon capture and storage at biofuels plants will cement ethanol and biodiesel as the lowest carbon liquid fuels commercially available in the marketplace. The Carbon Capture & Storage Summit will offer attendees a comprehensive look at the economics of carbon capture and storage the infrastructure required to make it possible and the financial and marketplace impacts to participating producers.View More",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vbXlyZXB1YmxpY2EubmFnYXJpa25ldHdvcmsuY29tL25ld3MvcHRjLWluZGlhLXRvLWJ1eS1lbGVjdHJpY2l0eS1nZW5lcmF0ZWQtZnJvbS1hcnVuLWlpaS_SAV9odHRwOi8vbXlyZXB1YmxpY2EubmFnYXJpa25ldHdvcmsuY29tL2FtcC9wdGMtaW5kaWEtdG8tYnV5LWVsZWN0cmljaXR5LWdlbmVyYXRlZC1mcm9tLWFydW4taWlpLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PTC India to buy electricity generated from Arun-III,"KATHMANDU August 6: The market for the electricity generated by the Arun-III hydropower project being built by India in Nepal has been ensured. The electricity of the hydropower being built by SJVN Arun-III Power Development Company under Sutluj Hydropower Development Corporation (SJVN) will be bought by PTC India.

A memorandum of understanding has been signed between SJVN Arun-III Power Development Company and PTC India. The Company is building the 900 MW Arun-III project in Sankhuwasabha Province 1 Nepal.

The process to build the Lower Arun Project of 669 MW has also been moved forward. Arun-III is scheduled to be built by 2024 while lower Arun will be completed by 2028 for commercial operation. The Arun-IV project will be handled by SJVN as well.

According to the agreement the electricity generated from these projects can be sold to the power distribution companies and wholesale consumers of the states along with the utility areas decided by the central government on the basis of long-term contracts in India.

""PTC will try to sell any untied capacity on medium and short-term basis or in power exchanges"" SJVN Arun-III Power Development Company said in a statement. Similarly PTC reports that the MoU with SJVN Arun-III Power Development Company is a milestone and the company believes that this will enable it to supply 3000 MW of hydropower from Nepal to India by 2030.

Earlier the government had given the responsibility to SJVN through a Project Development Agreement (PDA) on November 25 2014. The Prime Ministers of Nepal and India jointly launched the Arun III project by pressing the switch on May 12 2018 in New Delhi. At present more than 50 percent work of the tunnel and dam construction of the project is completed.

Meanwhile the government of Nepal will get 21.9 percent of the total electricity produced by the Arun III project i.e. 197.1 megawatts free of charge. Construction of power transmission lines is also underway in the project. The transmission line passing through Sankhuwasabha Bhojpur Khotang and other districts will be connected to the 400 KV national transmission line at Dhalkebar in Mahottari.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyYXBoaWMuY29tLmdoL25ld3MvZ2VuZXJhbC1uZXdzL3dvcmstb24tdC1kaS1wdGMta3dhbWUtbmtydW1haC1yb3VuZGFib3V0LXByb2dyZXNzZXMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Work on T'di PTC Kwame Nkrumah Roundabout progresses,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/work-on-t-di-ptc-kwame-nkrumah-roundabout-progresses.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyYXBoaWMuY29tLmdoL25ld3MvZ2VuZXJhbC1uZXdzL3dvcmstb24tdC1kaS1wdGMta3dhbWUtbmtydW1haC1yb3VuZGFib3V0LXByb2dyZXNzZXMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdG90YWxyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vd2lubmVyLW9mLXZvaWNlLW9mLXB1bmphYi1jaGhvdGEtY2hhbXAtc2Vhc29uLTgtZ3JhbmQtZmluYWxlLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Winner of Voice of Punjab Chhota Champ Season 8 Grand Finale 2022,"The time has come for the grand finale of the popular Punjabi singing reality show Voice of Punjab Chhota Champ season 8.

The Post got a firsthand look at Rumble in the Bronx (RBX) an underground promotion that makes its money on amateur bloodlust liquor and erotic dancing girls – which organizers insist doubles as a community safety project.

“I’m not a huge fan of people beating each other up but this was pretty well orchestrated” said Penny Lee a professional webcam girl who twerked between rounds as audience members made it rain with wads of singles. “It was a cool safe environment.”

Whether it’s a deli a self-storage pod or the back of an 18-wheeler the secret locations for RBX shows are always changing. The most recent venue was a Hunts Point junkyard where security checked IDs and patted people down for weapons.

Weed dealers were invited inside to sell strains called alien breath jelly donut and captain cake. A merch station run out of a minibus hawked RBX T-shirts. A local woman supplied chicken and cheeseburger empanadas for $5 a piece.

Flatbed trucks became makeshift VIP sections where high rollers ordered hookahs and bottles of Don Julio for $300.

RBX leader “Killa” Mike Roman distributed 30 pies donated by Bruckner Pizza who proudly sponsored the event along with The Print Lab.

“It’s about the community” said Bruckner Pizza owner Oscar who didn’t provide his last name. “I figured it was a good cause to give back to.”

Metal barricades with pool noodles wrapped around the bars as padding made up the “ring.” Instead of a canvas floor they used puzzle-piece foam mats.

Novice fighters — some wearing jeans — relied more on heart and haymakers than technique while more than 100 rabid fans cheered and shouted “F–k him up!”

Roman jeered at tied-up fighters saying “If you want to hug someone hug your girl after the match!” When a female boxer’s weave fell out he donned it and strutted around the ring to a roar of laughter.

DJ Shadow played G-Unit’s “I Smelly P—-y” for those who threw in the towel.

When fights went the distance — three three-minute rounds -— the winner was chosen by who got the most applause and Roman always made sure to commend both fighters as “real ganstas” and “warriors.”

Charles “Kanye West” Woods won the night’s first match. After a 15-minute back-and-forth full of combos uppercuts and jabs he and his opponent hugged.

9 Marijuana dealers are invited to RBX ring bouts. Steve Ferdman

“This seemed like a great way to test myself and maybe go viral” Woods said. “I wish I could’ve done better but I’m happy with the win.”

After a random callout which is encouraged one overzealous bruiser nicknamed “The Cuban Sandwich” allowed his opponent free chin shots resulting in a bloody busted nose.

“I’ve only had one serious injury but it was because one guy tried to bite another like some real Mike Tyson stuff” Roman said.

9 Rumble in the Bronx attracts more than 100 rowdy fans cheering for blood. Steve Ferdman

Fans who range from truck drivers and construction workers to artists and social media personalities see RBX as entertainment you can’t find anywhere else.

“It beats just chilling in the house or on the block” said Jonas Leon who works as a sound producer. “It’s a fun time and you never know what is going to happen but I also use it to network. Killa Mike is doing something positive. He’s good people.”

Despite all the borough support RBX is illegal.

9 Penny Lee a professional webcam girl claims Rumble in the Bronx offers a “cool safe environment.” Steve Ferdman

RBX isn’t sanctioned by the state Athletic Commission which aims to protect fighters from corrupt practices.

“In addition to the potentially serious health and public safety concerns there are both criminal and civil consequences of hosting underground fights” the agency said.

Martin Snow who runs the Trinity Boxing Club in Tribeca said it’s a recipe for disaster.

9 Penny Lee twerks between rounds as spectators rain wads of single dollar bills into the ring. Steve Ferdman

“Running a legitimate club these days is not easy and it’s not cheap but it’s required” he said. “For the people that cut corners it’s only a matter of time until someone gets hurt or killed.”

Roman who said RBX’s motto is “Guns down Gloves up” insisted his goal is to deliver a one-two punch to gun violence and squash personal feuds.

“The drinking the smoking the girls – that’s all stuff people gravitate toward” he said.

For a while now a few of the world’s biggest companies have partnered with teams in various sports. Just this year we’ve seen logos in the NBA and in Formula One. Now it’s time to see the same in the Premier League. In another surprising move Qualcomm and Snapdragon have partnered with Manchester United.

Manchester United is one of the most recognizable teams in the world even outside of football. Because of the team’s popularity the agreement is a big grab for Qualcomm. The company especially the Snapdragon brand will likely feature prominently around the team’s events. However the bigger question is what the tech brand can bring to the world of football.

According to Qualcomm’s announcement Snapdragon will help the team “create unique events and experiences for Manchester United fans at Old Trafford [the team’s home stadium] and around the world.” At the same time the company will also improve connectivity at Old Trafford. Given what the company has done before it’s also likely that it will provide the team with any tech needs the latter might have.

Surprisingly this isn’t Qualcomm’s first sports partnership this year. Earlier the company also announced a partnership with Ferrari’s Formula One team. Similarly Google partnered with a competing Formula One team McLaren. And speaking of Google the company also made the Pixel 6 series a major presence in the NBA last season.

Sports is one of the world’s most popular pastimes. Partnerships like these can work wonders in terms of a company’s presence albeit to surprising results.

Which happens to be a good way to describe Thibodeaux off the edge at Giants training camp.

No. 5 has been virtually unblockable flashing the otherworldly gifts that made him the fifth pick of the NFL draft.

General manager Joe Schoen and the Giants did their due diligence on Thibodeaux and so far so good … very good.

His brand is rushing the passer.

His brand is turning the corner.

His brand is bringing the heat.

His brand is disruption.

His brand is New York Football Giants.

He walked slowly out of the Quest Diagnostics Center following another sweltering practice. I was advised that he had time for only two questions. He has to lift.

“Get to the good ones” Thibodeaux said pleasantly.

He has been readily embraced by teammates who find him personable and likeable. His rookie rendition of The Notorius B.I.G.’s “Juicy” was applauded. His well-documented big personality has not in any way rocked the boat.

3 Kayvon Thibodeaux has quickly impressed his Giants teammates. Corey Sipkin for the NY POST

I asked him to explain why he has been virtually unblockable in this camp and he began by praising defensive coordinator Wink Martindale.

“Wink is doing a great job of putting me in different spots putting me in different positions to show my talent” Thibodeaux said “and then just keep working.”

Bill Parcells would have salivated over Thibodeaux a 6-foot-5 258-pound outside linebacker who is slighter bigger than Lawrence Taylor was as a rookie. There’s only one LT of course. But Giants fans can only dream of a KT playing like a crazed dog and having fun.

All eyes will be on Kayvon Thibodeaux on Thursday night in Foxborough Mass. when his first preseason sack could come against Bill Belichick’s Patriots.

“I’m excited. I know there’s gonna be a lot to show and I know I just gotta keep sharpening my tools and make sure that I’m ready when the time comes” Thibodeaux said.

If he feels any pressure to live up to the great expectations he sure is doing a good job of hiding it.

“Pressure comes when you’re not prepared” Thibodeaux said “so me I’m just trying to be prepared every day just come out and leave it all out there.”

Center Jon Feliciano is an eight-year veteran. He has seen his fair share of predators.

“He can really bend the edge and stay at top speed which is really hard to do” Feliciano said. “When he’s making a move it’s natural when you make a move that you kinda slow down a little bit. He’s able to do his best move in full speed and that’s pretty hard to block.”

3 Kayvon Thibodeaux has quieted much of the skepticism about his off-field demeanor. Noah K. Murray-NY Post

Feliciano an ex-Raider and ex-Bill was asked if Thibodeaux reminds him of anyone he has gone against or seen.

“That’s hard … he’s a different body type” Feliciano said.

“He has a little bit of Khalil Mack in him as in he can hit his best moves low in full speed which is really unique to do.”

I squeezed in a third question for Thibodeaux and asked him what message he would give to Giants fans right now about himself.

“That I’m gonna just work” he said. “I might make some mistakes and it might not be as pretty as they want it to be but I’m gonna keep going and I’m gonna keep stacking my days.”

A little bit of Khalil Mack is plenty pretty. With the best yet to come.",,,,,,,,,

TAMPA Fl. -- The Tampa Bay Buccaneers just hit Day 10 of training camp and after a break on Monday will turn the corner into their first game week of the preseason.

Closing out Week 2 rookie end Cade Otton put on a show in front of countless fans and media who left the AdventHealth Training Center even more impressed than they had been before.

Before he could win on the practice field he had to get on it.

And getting cleared for training camp was an early win for Otton who suffered an ankle injury in mid-November during his final season with the Washington Huskies.

""I feel great just having a ton of fun."" Otton said following practice on Sunday. ""Feeling better every single day just going through the movements that you have to go through to play football at an NFL level. It's been good.""

Drafted at the top of the fourth round of this year's NFL Draft Otton is another in a line of prospects general manager Jason Licht has brought in to Tampa Bay who have an injury history but a ton of untapped potential as well.

Helping Otton reach his faster is a talented tight end room for the Buccaneers led by veterans Cameron Brate and free agent addition Kyle Rudolph.

""We have a lot of rookies but those two vets they've seen a lot of football and they're super great guys too"" Otton said of Brate and Rudolph. ""They're willing to help out a lot and mentor us as we go through these growing pains and bring us along for the team.""

Of course as great as the veteran tight ends have been for Otton and his rapid development having a future Hall of Fame quarterback and a prior first-round NFL Draft selection throwing you the ball doesn't hurt either.

""Gotta earn it every day"" Otton said when asked about getting end zone looks from the two established quarterbacks. ""Gotta earn their trust make plays and there's still some plays out there but when the ball comes your way you gotta build that trust.""

On Sunday Otton built a lot of trust. Overall the rookie tight end brought in three touchdown passes between Brady and Gabbert and whenever the two looked towards No. 88 there was a play to potentially be made.

On August 4 NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport revealed that after not playing for two years Alonso was headed back to the Saints. “Alonso worked out for New Orleans this morning and is expected to sign source said” Rapoport tweeted. “He hasn’t played since 2019 but is in shape and the Saints will take a shot given his familiarity.”

On August 5 the team announced that they signed the 6-foot-3 239-pound linebacker but it seems one practice was enough for the University of Oregon alum.

WWLTV Sports’ reporter Brooke Kirchofer tweeted on Saturday August 6 “Alonso has retired per source. The #Saints brought him in for one training camp practice after playing the 2019 season in New Orleans. He’s decided to hang it up after 6 seasons in the #NFL.”

Alonso’s career started off strong after the Bills drafted him as their No. 46 overall pick. After signing a four-year $4.3 million contract as a rookie earning the title of NFL Defensive Rookie of the Month in September. After starting all 16 games Alonso finished the season with 159 tackles four interceptionsfour pass deflections two sacks and one forced fumble.

Alonso Was Traded to the Eagles In Exchange for LeSean McCoy

Unfortunately Alonso only played one season with the Bills. During his sophomore year Alonso suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and was ruled out for the rest of the season a devastating blow considering he had placed second in The AP’s NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year voting per ESPN.

In March 2015 the Bills traded Alonzo to the Philadelphia Eagles in exchange for superstar running back LeSean McCoy. Landing McCoy who signed a five-year $40 million contract with Buffalo was a huge boost for the franchise. He finished his first year with the Bills with 203 carries for 895 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns along with 292 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns.

McCoy absolutely went off during the 2017 NFL season and helped Buffalo end its 17-year playoff drought. “Shady” finished the regular season with 1138 rushing yards and eight total touchdowns per Pro Football Reference.

Alonso Last Played During the Saints Wild Card Playoff Game in 2019

After one season with the Eagles Alonso spent three years with the Miami Dolphins where he racked up a total of 355 tackles. However Alonso was traded to the Saints in September 2019 in exchange for linebacker Vince Beigel.

During the Saints’ NFC Wild Card Game loss to the Minnesota Vikings on January 6 Alonso suffered a torn and ACL for the third time in his career. In November 2020 he was traded to the San Francisco 49ers but was ultimately waived by the team after a failed physical.

The company has discounted the price of their GeForce RTX 3090 FTW3 Gaming edition by a whopping $1000 to $1149. This gargantuan instant rebate nearly halves the model’s $2149 MSRP and it's not the only one either.As it stands the RTX 3090 Ti represents NVIDIA’s “ very fastest GPU on the planet.” The card features 10752 CUDA cores with 24 GB of GDDR6X memory. The cores can achieve boost clocks of 1890 MHz while the memory clocks an effective 21000 MHz for 1008 GB/s of bandwidth as configured by EVGA. The vanilla RTX 3090 leverages 10496 CUDA cores at up to 1695 MHz with the same 24GB of GDDR6X capacity clocked a hair cooler for 936 GB/s of bandwidth.Recent pricing has seen RTX 3090 Ti cards hovering in the neighborhood of $1300 to $1500 depending on the model and deal which is already a fair discount from the Founder Edition’s targeted $2000 MSRP. This is a welcome relief from the days when the RTX 3090 Ti was nigh impossible to buy like most other cards on the market. EVGA’s special pricing here though brings things within spitting distance of the RTX 3090 and RTX 3080 Ti.The FTW model is not the only variant EVGA is discounting either. The RTX 3090 Ti FTW Ultra Gaming is similarly discounted by $1000 to $1199. Every other RTX 3090 Ti model the company offers is enjoying at least a $500 price cut as well including the FTW3 Ultra Hybrid Gaming model which mixes in liquid cooling for just $1499 after a $700 instant rebate.Even if the price is right gamers may still want to hold off. We are approaching the release of NVIDIA’s 40-series graphics cards due out before the end of the year. Rumors and leaks are flowing in abundance and some are claiming the RTX 4070 Ti will be able to go toe-to-toe with the current RTX 3090 Ti heavyweight. If true and assuming supply manages to hold buyers will likely be able to wield this level of power at an even lower price.If unparalleled performance is truly a must more rumors suggest the RTX 4090 Ti will be an absolute unit . It could possess 18176 CUDA cores while doubling the VRAM to 48 GB. The card would achieve this by using virtually all of a AD102 die and sucking up an eye watering amount of power.Then again who is to really say what the future holds ? Rising tensions between China and Taiwan threaten not only the tech sector but also the greater geopolitical landscape. Other natural disasters or a couple more “ unprecedented events ” could likewise land us in another shortage. So why not roll the dice today and jump on this deal while it is hot?,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9ldmdhLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTMwOTAtdGktZnR3My1kcm9wcy10by0xMTQ5LXVzZC1pdC1pcy1ub3ctMTAwMC11c2QtY2hlYXBlctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EVGA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti FTW3 drops to 1149 USD it is now 1000 USD cheaper,"NVIDIA RTX 3090 Ti getting even cheaper

The flagship RTX 3090 Ti drops by 1000 USD in just few months.

The official MSRP for RTX 3090 Ti is 1999 USD but EVGA custom models with their better cooling and higher performance were sold at higher price. The cheapest FTW3 model introduced with a price of 2149 USD is now available for … 1000 USD less.

Just three weeks ago we reported on unofficial price cuts being introduced by some retailers and board partners including EVGA. The company was actually among the few that lower the price of RTX 3090 Ti to 1499 USD. Just three weeks later this price is further reduced by 350 USD.

EVGA 3090 Ti FTW3 cards are now sold for 1150 USD to 1400 USD. One should note that the BLACK edition available at 1400 USD is actually less powerful than ULTRA (lower clocks) sold for 200 USD less. The new price does not apply to HYDRO Copper and KINGPIN Hybrid SKUs both are still listed at 1500 and 2000 USD respectively.

The GA102-powered graphics cards is one of the best graphics cards right now which debuted early this year at $1999.

The GeForce RTX 3090 Ti FTW3 Gaming which is the least expensive SKU on EVGA's lineup now sells for $1149 47% cheaper than what the company used to sell it for. At $1149 the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti FTW3 Ultra Gaming is also one of the most affordable custom GeForce RTX 3090 Ti models on the market. It's no push-over on the performance side either. The graphics card flaunts a 1890 MHz boost clock.

If you need something with a bit more firepower the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti FTW3 Ultra Gaming retails for $1199 on EVGA's store. It carries a $50 premium over the non-ultra model but offers a 30 MHz higher boost clock speed. The GeForce RTX 3090 Ti FTW3 Ultra Gaming is the second fastest model in the lineup with a factory overclock that pushes the boost lock to 1920 MHz.

The GeForce RTX 3090 Ti FTW3 Ultra Gaming is also available with a hybrid cooling design. The GeForce RTX 3090 Ti FTW3 Ultra Hybrid Gaming goes for $1499 $300 more expensive than the air-cooled counterpart. In addition the graphics card arrives with a beefy 360mm AIO cooler for maximum heat dissipation.

Even the exclusive GeForce RTX 3090 Ti K|NGP|N Hybrid Gaming is one sale but unfortunately it's out of stock. The over-engineered graphics card which caters to extreme overclockers used to carry an eye-watering price tag of $2499. EVGA has lowered the price to $1999 which still costs more than your average high-performance gaming PC. For what it's worth EVGA includes a ""free"" SuperNOVA 1600W P2 power supply.

EVGA's GeForce RTX 3090 Ti graphics cards come with Nvidia's latest ""Face Your Demons"" bundle that consists of Ghostwire: Tokyo Doom Eternal and Doom Eternal Year One Pass (Includes Doom Eternal: The Ancient Gods Part One & Part Two and Battlemode).

Graphics card pricing started to plummet a few months ago as Ethereum is nearing its transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain. Cryptocurrency miners have started to offload their hardware on the second-hand market to cut losses whereas scalpers have also lowered pricing on platforms like eBay. EVGA is probably attempting to get rid of Ampere inventory while the company still can. Pricing will most likely continue to improve in the upcoming months as Nvidia readies its GeForce RTX 40-series (Ada Lovelace) graphics cards and AMD answering the call with its RDNA 3 graphics cards. Let's not forget that Intel also has Arc Alchemist which the chipmaker expects to bring to the market in the summer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3ZWFrdG93bi5jb20vbmV3cy84NzgxMi9ldmdhLXNsYXNoZXMtMTAwMC1mcm9tLWl0cy1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDkwLXRpLWZ0dy0yMTQ5LXRvLTExNDkvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EVGA slashes $1000 from its GeForce RTX 3090 Ti FTW: $2149 to $1149,"EVGA has just slashed a huge $1000 from its enthusiast-ready GeForce RTX 3090 Ti FTW3 graphics card which cost $2149 just a week ago... and now it's down to $1149.

The custom EVGA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti FTW3 graphics card was introduced at $2149 with it being the cheapest of the three SKUs that EVGA has in its GeForce RTX 3090 Ti arsenal. As it stands EVGA is selling its GeForce RTX 3090 Ti FTW3 graphics cards for between $1150 and $1400.

EVGA is discounting $1000 from its GeForce RTX 3090 Ti FTW3 ULTRA graphics card as well down from $2199 to $1199 while the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti FTW3 BLACK is $600 discounted down from $1999 to $1399. EVGA is still selling its higher-end GeForce RTX 3090 Ti HYDRO Copper and GeForce RTX 3090 Ti KINGPIN Hybrid graphics cards for $1500 and $2000 respectively.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy9udmlkaWEtcnR4LTMwOTAtdGktc2xhc2hlZC1ieS1kb2xsYXIxMDAwLWluLWFub3RoZXItY2xlYXItc2lnbi10aGF0LWdwdS1wcmljZXMtYXJlLXR1bWJsaW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia RTX 3090 Ti slashed by $1000 in another clear sign that GPU prices are tumbling,"EVGA has just reduced the price of its base RTX 3090 Ti graphics card to $1000 below the MSRP in the US in a clear sign that high-end GPU prices are still coming down rapidly.

Yes an eagled-eyed denizen of Twitter spotted that there’s a clear thousand bucks off the FTW3 Gaming model which has a recommended price of $2150 and is now $1150 at the card maker’s online store so it’s now pretty close to half-price.

Holy Crap but Jay said to buy now? pic.twitter.com/G96qqouSqHAugust 6 2022

The FTW3 Ultra Gaming model isn’t much more expensive at $1200 coming with a slightly higher boost speed (so it’s certainly another option should the base FTW3 graphics card sell out of stock).

Note that the official MSRP for the RTX 3090 Ti is $2000 (£1879 AU$2499) but EVGA put a slight premium on its FTW3 versions due to beefed up cooling systems that allow the GPU to run a bit faster.

Analysis: To buy or to wait?

To put this price into perspective with the rest of the range EVGA’s RTX 3080 Ti is running at $1100 right now so you can get the 3090 Ti for only fifty bucks more making it a total no-brainer for those who want a top-end Ampere graphics card from EVGA at the moment (assuming their PC case thermals and PSU can cope with the 3090 Ti of course).

As you may recall recently Nvidia officially reduced the RTX 3090 Ti to $1500 (along with price cuts to other top dog Ampere graphics cards) but the flagship GPU appears to be quickly tumbling from even that reduced level. At Newegg you can pick up a Zotac 3090 Ti for $1240 now for example but EVGA’s price undercuts that by almost a further hundred dollars.

Something we’ve been hearing on the grapevine consistently in recent times is that Nvidia’s partners have excess stock of RTX 3000 cards to clear and this would seem to be a pretty clear indication that this may indeed be the case.

It’s certainly a big price reduction by EVGA and if next-gen Lovelace GPUs are coming close to launch now the first one out the door will purportedly be the RTX 4090 – so it makes sense that the biggest discounts should be applied to the top end RTX 3090 and 3090 Ti first as these will rapidly become less tempting propositions as the Lovelace release timeframe nears.

What could happen now is that more graphics card manufacturers lower their 3090 Ti prices (and maybe other high-end Nvidia models) and we could see a race to sell them off – potentially. That said if we’re looking at almost half-price already there has to be a limit to how low things will go and at its current price the EVGA RTX 3090 Ti looks none too shabby to say the least.

On the other hand when Lovelace arrives rumor has it that the RTX 4070 could be the equal of the 3090 Ti (or maybe even a touch faster) – but then it’s expected to be the most popular model of the higher-end Lovelace offerings so buying it at MSRP could prove challenging (or even buying it at all perhaps initially). Especially if the 4070 offers as much of a jaw-dropping price to performance value proposition as speculation seems to suggest.

And with the RTX 4070 potentially not arriving this year as another rumor contends grabbing the RTX 3090 Ti when it gets even cheaper may not be such a bad move after all – at least for those who don’t have the patience to see how the Lovelace rollout and stock situation pans out. We’d still advise waiting ourselves but then again we’d understand those who want to make the leap now…

Every summer when the temperature reaches 23C people around the country decide it’s time to cook outdoors and eat burnt burgers with a slice of plastic cheese and a dry sausage.

Oh and do you know what I want as a side to my sausage? A plain hot dog in a bun and sweaty shop-bought coleslaw with some warm but not cooked veggie skewers. While we’re at it I would also love a plain chicken breast cooked dry while I run away from wasps and fail to cut it up with plastic cutlery and drop my soggy paper plate in the process.

Really the best thing that ever goes on at most BBQs at least the ones I go to are bananas and chocolate cooked in foil as a dessert. Those are delicious quite frankly. What’s not to love about oozing chocolate melted over a banana? But then there’s not a lot that can go wrong with that.

Then there’s that one friend who does a BBQ right. There will be caramelised onions for the hot dogs a fresh salad with homemade dressing meat from the local butcher cooked to perfection maybe some marinated pork skewers and even the kind of spiral Italian sausage Tony Soprano would be proud of. These grilling gods are an anomaly in Britain.

There are nations that can barbecue incredibly well. The Australians are pretty good at it for example – it’s basically an art form there – and so are the South Africans where it’s called a “braai”. I recently passed by a Filipino food van called Bongbong’s Manila Kitchen (near Southbank) that used to be called “BBQ dreamz” at which I ate gorgeously crispy-on-the-outside tender-on-the-inside satay chicken skewer on rice and salad – the perfect accompanient to a chilled beer on a hot summer’s day.

But my favourite perhaps are the American “pitmasters” particularly in the southeastern states. The American BBQ has a long history; even George Washington mentions “barbicue” in his writings of 1769. It owes a lot to African Americans who helped develop and popularise the grill over generations. Originally grilling over fire was just used as a way of slow roasting tough joints of meat – humble beginnings which are still reflected in modern BBQs to this day.

Recently I went to an American-Mexican BBQ joint in Hackney Wick called Scoundrels. I had a deliciously over-the-top and filthy brisket burger which was tenderly cooked ever so slightly red on the inside and topped with bacon pickles chipotle mayo and two types of cheese served oozing out the sides of a brioche bun. The week after I was in a garden at a family BBQ with a stale recently defrosted bun filled with charred meat and a soggy bit of warm lettuce.

I’m not saying that everyone should be aiming to meet the standards of a pop-up restaurant – after all cooking over an open flame is one of the hardest ways to cook – but is it too much to ask that we eat something… well nice?

And if we must insist on barbecuing in this country can we at least all agree not to burn everything?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9iaWctYmFuZy10aGVvcnktZmFucy1mbGFiYmVyZ2FzdGVkLTE5MDAwMDYxOC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Big Bang Theory' Fans Are Flabbergasted Over Kaley Cuoco's Plunging Red Dress,"Photo credit: Axelle/Bauer-Griffin - Getty Images

Soon after Big Bang Theory star Kaley Cuoco went viral on Instagram of her wearing a see-through lace dress her keen eye for style is making her trend once again.

On June 20 fans happened to notice an old picture of The Flight Attendant actress floating around on Instagram. Taken on the red carpet at the 2016 InStyle and Warner Bros. Golden Globes after-party Kaley was at the center of another bombshell fashion moment.

Wearing a red spaghetti strap dress with a plunging neckline and thigh-high slit the 8 Simple Rules alum let the gown shine on its own with strappy black heels and minimal jewelry. As for her hair and makeup Kaley tied the look together with bouncy curls and a simple smoky eye.

As more red carpet photos from the event started making the rounds on Instagram Kaley's followers were immediately stunned by how beautiful she looked. They quickly took note and gave their opinions about her award show style despite the picture being taken close to seven years ago.

""RED IS DEFINITELY YOUR COLOR I HAVE SEEN SEVERAL ❤️❤️❤️"" one fan wrote. ""Pity I can only 'like' this photo once. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"" another follower commented. ""Dynamite 😍😍 Impressive gorgeous beauty 😍 ❤️❤️❤️"" a different person responded.

There's no doubt Kaley's going to turn heads in her next red carpet outfit as she will hopefully be attending the 2022 Primetime Emmy Awards on September 12. After all she is nominated for two awards including Best Actress in a Comedy for portraying Cassie Bowden in The Flight Attendant. So really it's only a matter of time before her fans get stunned by her once more.

What is the ideal state according to Plato’s Republic?

Plato (left) and Aristotle (right) walking together as seen in The School of Athens by Rafael c. 1509-1511

Plato’s legacy stands at par with his mentor Socrates and his most famous pupil Aristotle. Having witnessed the execution of Socrates at the hands of the Athenian state Plato became a loud critic of the political landscape of his time. The school of his philosophy fits neatly into what has come to be known as idealism – ideas based on ethereal other-worldly ideals. Rafael represents Platonic ideals in his above work The School of Athens via Plato on the left gesturing upwards. If Plato thought in terms of ideals what did Plato’s ideal Republic look like – after he suffered at the hands of his actual government?

Ideals in Plato’s Republic

Pericles’ Funeral Oration by Philipp Foltz c. 1852 via Engelsberg Ideals

In Plato’s time the Athenians saw themselves as the stewards of Greek culture and influence. Many Athenians held themselves as superior to other surrounding Greek-speaking city-states simply because of their social structure and political organization. In Platonic terms Athens saw itself as the ideal Greek state.

Even prior to the execution of his mentor Plato saw through the cracks of the Athenian political facade. Much of Plato’s output criticized the structure of the Athenian society which in turn was directed as the structure of their politics – at the time one of the most advanced in the world.

Central to his critique was the absence of a place in society for the educated. Plato believed that those who naturally dominate society should be those who are learned; philosophers themselves were central to Plato’s ideal social structure. This ideal ruler was dubbed the Philosopher King; in Plato’s mind the right to rule ought to be exclusive to philosophers – they are a facet of society above everybody else.

Philosopher Kings were defined as those with a thirst for knowledge: a trait instilled in Plato himself by his mentor Socrates. The Athenian state evidently viewed philosophers as a social nuisance. Those who roamed around and loudly questioned authority or interrogated political figures – exactly the role Socrates played as depicted by Plato – were a thorn in the side of the administration.

Plato and the Philosopher King

Last Words of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius by Eugène Delacroix c. 1844 via Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon

In addition to being a 90s Canadian pop band the Philosopher King was Plato’s ideal vision of a political leader. Plato believed that this position should be reserved for the most curious benevolent just kind and altruistic in a society. In his mind these were philosophers.

Philosophers prior to Socrates were simply those who sought to explain the inexplicable. Socratic curiosity and knowledge or lack thereof infiltrated Athenian society as the man roamed the streets questioning various figures of society. The main idea Socrates carried was that he knew and assumed nothing; he simply held a line of questioning to assorted figures and used their own assertions against them to poke holes in their own logic.

This led to the birth of Western Philosophy and instilled in Plato a deep and profound love for curiosity and wonder. This love was unique to a philosopher and therefore places them in a distinct social class – the only one fit to rule.

Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius later exemplified this idea. His quiet and thoughtful introspection (being a philosopher in the school of Stoicism himself) offers evidence of prosperity of society under a Philosopher King.

Beyond the Philosopher King at the top the rest of society would ideally be made up of producers at the bottom and auxiliaries (or soldiers) in the middle. But what dictates the organization of these three social classes?

Plato and the Tripartite Platonic Soul

Chariot Race by Jean-Léon Gérôme c. 1876 via Art Institute of Chicago

The effectiveness (and danger) of Plato’s writing comes from his ability to conjure and create mythical stories to justify his rhetoric. In fact the myth of the lost city of Atlantis was mentioned by Plato as means to prove his point on hubris.

Plato justifies his quasi-fascistic outlook of society by arguing that it reflects nature. The claim is that the human soul – a topic with which ancient Greek thinkers were infatuated – is also divided into three parts. Plato’s Chariot Allegory holds that all human beings are represented by a charioteer and two horses. The charioteer himself represents human reason; one horse represents rational capacity (equated to the human mind) while the other horse represents our irrational capacity fueled by desire and pleasure (equated to the body). The state and the soul stand in perfect analogy.

Philosopher Kings are firmly in control of their chariot and perfectly balance the two horses to achieve enlightenment. The myth fabricated by Plato is that these individuals are born with gold in their souls and should therefore hold an elite space in society. This caste represents the virtues of reason and justice.

The auxiliaries (or soldiers) Plato’s following social caste are to serve protect and keep order about society. Soldiers represent the virtues of discipline and Plato’s mythical justification is silver rooted within their souls.

At the bottom of the Platonic caste system are producers. They represent members of society such as farmers and those who create materials needed for comfort and pleasure within a society. These people service predominantly their irrational capacity and insatiable desire for pleasure and comfort. Ideally the virtue of this caste would be moderation – an idea furthered by Aristotle.

The Republic

Death of Socrates by Jacque-Louis David 1787 via the Met Museum

Plato’s most well-known written work is The Republic. Like all his works The Republic is constructed as a dialogue consisting of several characters. Plato implements the character of his mentor Socrates as his mouthpiece for his philosophical inquiry. The art skill and danger of Plato’s writing lies here; as each character represents different facets of philosophy Plato can manipulate their ideas to distort his own.

The main theme of the work is justice – the question of how integral a part of society it is. Plato through his mouthpiece Socrates discusses the notion of justice with various members of Athenian society.

Among many other arguments conversations and themes in Plato’s Republic he arrives at the discussion of the Philosopher King. As stated the idea here is that the Philosopher King is the most virtuous and just of a society. Plato claims that these virtues are often honed through education.

The character of Socrates goes on to outline different political systems and offers critiques of them all (including democracy). Plato argues that a state cycles through all political systems until it finally arrives at tyranny – the worst of all.

The virtues of the Philosopher King naturally prevent the decay of society seeing as they are benevolent and just. They defend society from the dominance of an aristocracy keep the balance between the elite and the majority from tipping to a democracy – a bad thing according to Plato – and rid society of corrupt demagogues with honeyed political words.

Plato’s Republic and the Kallipolis

The Tower of Babel by Pieter Brueghel the Elder c. 1563 via Wikimedia Commons

Remember when I said how good Plato was at implementing storytelling and mythology in his rhetoric? The mythical city of Kallipolis (which is literally Greek for “good city”) was the canvas on which Plato projected his ideas.

Kallipolis was Plato’s idea of a utopian society purged of all evil and vices; a well-oiled political machine that functions perfectly to sustain itself and strive towards peace and prosperity. Platonic society is evidently governed by highly learned Philosopher Kings – each educated from birth for fifty years prior to taking control of Kallipolis.

Society is divided into Plato’s strict caste system in which there is no internal room for movement or transition. Children upon being born immediately become the possession of the state and not the family. Children of weaker genetics or stature would be “removed” by the state – this was practiced by the ancient Spartans to keep their populace as physically elite as possible.

Censorship of the arts are enforced; this is justified by Plato’s ability of storytelling and myth connecting – the state approves one truth and it is to be the only acceptable truth. Plato saw the arts as means of distorting rhetoric and sensationalizing public affairs therefore he kept no place for it in Kallipolis.

Kallipolis is often depicted in art as the Tower of Babel. The story of the Tower alleges that at one time all humans could speak the same language. This facilitated conversation cooperation and social advancement – manifested in the construction of a massive tower. God seeing the tower as a challenge to His authority destroyed it and split the world and the people on it into many smaller cultures and languages. It is a lesson on hubris and humility.

Plato’s Republic and His Ideals

Plato’s Symposium by Anselm Feuerbach c. 1869 via Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe

In simple terms Plato favored a heavily structured society in which the state possessed immense totalitarian power and control over the populace. This was justified in that the ruler the Philosopher King spends most of his life preparing to govern such a society.

Plato’s ideals for society have been both supported and refuted over the years. His concepts of the one (state sponsored) universal truth his criticism of the arts critique of democracy and heavily segregated ideal social structure are among the most commented proposals he crafted.

Whether one agrees with his ideals or not Plato influenced an immense number of philosophers in his wake.

Barcelona vs. Pumas live updates highlights commentary

FULL-TIME: Barcelona 6-0 Pumas

It's a complete and total destruction at the hands of the hosts at Camp Nou. Pumas sadly never stood a chance — Barcelona were the better side for each and every one of the 90 minutes.

The La Liga giants look primed for a revival campaign after the struggles of last season with Robert Lewandowski set to play a starring role (so long as they can get him registered).

86th min: Chance Pumas! The best opportunity for the visitors yet comes with Pumas 6-0 down but Inaki Pena denies the chance with a great save. It came off spectacular work by Cesar Huerta down the right skipping past a defender before feeding Jeronimo Rodriguez for the shot.

84th min: GOAL BARCELONA! Oof this is getting rough for Pumas. Frenkie de Jong straight-up picks a defender's pocket leaving him all alone on net. He makes no mistake one-on-one against Gonzalez and it's now 6-0. The ugliest goal yet in a litany of defensive nightmares from the visitors at the Camp Nou.

83rd min: Pumas goalkeeper Gonzalez makes an outstanding save on Aubameyang from a tight angle after the Gabonese international got free on a Barcelona corner but it likely wouldn't have counted had it gone in as Aubameyang was clearly offside. A wonder the linesman didn't flag.

72nd min: Barcelona are probing in spurts and Kessie is tackled in the penalty area to stop a chance. It rolled to Memphis on the end line but the Pumas goalkeeper is there to stop the chance. Moments later Girard Pique has a back-heel flick stopped at the near post in what would have been an incredible goal for the defender.

65th min: The hosts have another slew of substitutes on with Sergino Dest Memphis Depay and Inaki Pena all off the bench. Jules Kounde also comes on for his Barcelona debut.

The home side has again backed off a bit pushing forward in sputs when they have numbers but not pressing the issue with as much intensity as earlier in the half.

59th min: Dani Alves is subbed off for Pumas to a huge ovation from the Camp Nou. He gets a big hug from Barcelona manager Xavi and goes through the entire Barcelona bench getting high-fives. An emotional moment.

49th min: GOAL BARCELONA! After a furious start to the first half the hosts have begun the same in the second with reinforcements on the pitch. It's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang with the final touch meeting Franck Kessie's cross from the left. Lewandowski was involved yet again earning the ""hockey assist"" with his excellent thread to spring Kessie.

48th min: Frenkie de Jong with an audacious little back-heel flick to see Barcelona into the attack. Ansu Fati the brightest of the newcomers here in the second half.

46th min: The second half is under way with a host of changes for the home side. Gerard Pique Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang Franck Kessie Jordi Alba Ninco Gonzalez and Frenkie de Jong are all out of the tunnel and onto the field for the second half.

The Barcelona lineup is now: Ter Stegen; Roberto Pique Araujo Alba; de Jong Kessie Gonzalez; Aubameyang Lewandowski Fati.

The announced attendance of 83021. Quite the turnout for home fans to watch their new-look Barcelona squad.

HALF-TIME: Barcelona 4-0 Pumas UNAM

It was total and complete domination from Barcelona in the first half dominating possession and carving the Pumas defense to shreds. Pedri found the back of the net twice both created by Robert Lewandowski who was brilliant through the entire half.

Even when Barcelona took their foot off the gas and sat back Pumas had to fight hard just to string a few passes together. The Mexican side forced ter Stegen into just one save with little else to do the entire 45 minutes.

40th min: Barcelona have backed off a bit and the two teams have traded fruitless possession in midfield over the past 10 minutes. Pumas are unable to even string together passes against a passive Barcelona.

31st min: Chance Pumas! It's the first action for Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen who saves down low to his left on a shot from Juan Dinenno that was seeking the inside of the post.

29th min: Dani Alves is doing his best to get Pumas out of danger as he uses some beautiful skill to get around two Barcelona attackers in his own penalty area but seconds after he finds a teammate it's given away. The Mexican side is just being overwhelmed by a Barcelona team that's gearing up for a strong start to the Spanish top flight season and could challenge the best in the Champions League.

24th min: Chance Barcelona! Every Barcelona attack seems to produce a great opportunity on goal and this time only fate keeps the ball from finding the back of the net. First Lewandowski produces a great looping feed to Raphinha on the left edge of the six-yard box but his tight-angle shot cracks the woodwork.

On the follow-up Dembele finds Lewandowski on the doorstep but this time it pings the right post and rebounds right into the breadbasket of the Pumas goalkeeper. How that stayed out we'll never know.

21st min: Gavi earns the game's first yellow card on what appeared to be a clean tackle as the Barcelona midfielder went to ground but got there first and clipped the ball. It's an odd call potentially encouraged by Gustavo de Prete who went rolling into oblivion holding his face and thigh.

19th min: GOAL BARCELONA! Lewandowski and Pedri link up again and it's an absolutely tasty one that sees the former deliver a gorgeous back-heel flick to the latter who's all by himself. Again the Pumas defense is nowhere to be found and the La Liga giants glide right through the back line with ease.

A perfect flick and finish 🤩 pic.twitter.com/VCbVTbmxOr — FC Barcelona (@FCBarcelona) August 7 2022

15th min: Already 3-0 down Pumas have finally grown into the match starting to possess the ball. The match is gone by now but they will look to win segments of the game moving forward with the final score quite irrelevent.

10 min: GOAL BARCELONA! What a nightmare start for the Mexican club it's a total demolition. This time it's Ousmane Dembele who rips it past Gonzalez inside the near post. The Pumas defense is all over the place and nobody was there to mark the Frenchman.

5th min: GOAL BARCELONA! What a start for Barcelona! Lewandowski goes from scorer to provider as he feeds a little flick through to a streaking Pedri in on goal. The young midfielder also gets around the goalkeeper and pokes into the empty net.

The definition of class 👏 pic.twitter.com/tK7VsQacvf — FC Barcelona (@FCBarcelona) August 7 2022

4th min: GOAL BARCELONA! It's a fast start for the hosts as Robert Lewandowski gets Barcelona on the board first with a spectacular opener. Down the left edge of the six-yard box the Polish international rounds the goalkeeper to nearly the end line where he flicks a finish into the side netting from an incredibly tight angle.

😍 @lewy_official's first goal for Barça at Spotify Camp Nou! 💙❤️ pic.twitter.com/UoqaqK8HM4 — FC Barcelona (@FCBarcelona) August 7 2022

3rd min: Barcelona already on the front foot as Ousmane Dembele sends in a pinpoint cross from deep down the right flank but Pumas goalkeeper Julio Gonzalez comes flying in to punch it away before it can reach Lewandowski and the Mexican side clears. It figures to be a busy day for the Pumas shot-stopper between the sticks.

1st min: Kickoff is a few minutes late but the match is under way from the Camp Nou in Barcelona!

Pre-Match: Barcelona vs. Pumas

15 mins to kick: New Barcelona striker Robert Lewandowski got a big hand from the home supporters when announced as a starter at the Camp Nou for the first time.

35 mins to kick: Former Barcelona star Dani Alves starts for Pumas UNAM making an emotional return to the Camp Nou. He was surely critical in seeing the Liga MX side selected to play in this rescheduled match.

55 mins to kick: The Barcelona lineup is in. Robert Lewandowski starts for Barcelona up front supported by Ousmane Dembele and Raphinha on the wings. Sergi Roberto a natural midfielder starts at right-back over American full-back Sergino Dest.

65 mins to kick: In the increasingly commercialized business of top-flight football the Camp Nou this year will be known as the ""Spotify Camp Nou"" for sponsorship purposes so don't flinch when you see the awkward new name. The club's social media channels are already making sure to include the new moniker on everything.

🔜 Trofeo Joan Gamper — FC Barcelona (@FCBarcelona_es) August 7 2022

72 mins to kick: The Joan Gamper Trophy is a pre-season event hosted by Barcelona since 1966 named after a famous founding member and former player at the club.

Pumas are only in the 2022 edition of the Joan Gamper Trophy (pictured above held by Sergio Busquets) after the withdrawal of AS Roma in mid-June who stated they needed to ""adjust the schedule for summer-friendly matches"" to play games ""near to home with less travel necessary."" It was thought that Barcelona may sue Roma for the withdrawal but nothing on that front has materialized since.

105 mins to kick: Pumas fans whether from local or abroad are on site and marching to the Camp Nou! What a moment for both the club and its supporters to be playing at one of Europe's most famous arenas.

120 mins to kick: The storyline ahead of the Barcelona season is the club's inability to register players. There is just a week left to go before their campaign begins and the club's wage bill is unsustainable as-is La Liga has determined.

Multiple reports including ESPN claim that the club currently cannot register all five summer signings of Robert Lewandowski Raphinha Andreas Christensen Jules Kunde and Franck Kessie for league play this season. The club has already triggered multiple financial loopholes attempting to free up money to sign the players but more work is still to be done.

Today's match will be about the performances on the field but there is much work to be done off it if Barcelona are to take full advantage of their summer overhaul. The squad is bursting at the seams and there could be a host of sales to come as the club looks to free up wages and secure incoming transfer fees.

Barcelona have been told by La Liga they will need to activate a fourth ‘economic lever’ to register their summer signings.

Barcelona vs. Pumas lineups & team news

With the La Liga season set to begin in one week's time Barcelona will look to build chemistry among players in the expected starting lineup. Xavi will get headaches trying to fit his best attacking talent into the lineup on a weekly basis with so many world-class attacking players at his disposal.

Talisman Robert Lewandowski was a lock to start up front long-term and his supporting cast isOusmane Dembele and Raphinha. That leaves Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang Ansu Fati and Memphis Depay are on the bench while Ferran Torres is behind the others working his way back from an offseason injury.

In defense Gerard Pique has been a key leader at the back when healthy but is rested in this match before the season begins. Instead it's Ronald Araujo and Eric Garcia partnered together and natural midfielder Sergi Roberto moves to right-back over Sergino Dest. Andreas Christensen Pique and new arrival Jules Kounde are all on the bench. New midfield man Franck Kessie also gets a rest from the start in today's friendly after a solid preseason performance likely to make an appearance in the second half.

⚽ Barça vs Pumas pic.twitter.com/LwqipKMwEo — FC Barcelona (@FCBarcelona) August 7 2022

The lineup headliner for Mexican side Pumas UNAM is former Barcelona player Dani Alves who surely factored into the selection of his new club to play in this match.

Pumas are in the midst of a strange Apertura season with five draws through the first six matches. Head coach Andres Lillini can't seem to get star striker Juan Dinenno going after his successful finish to last season with the Argentine stuck on just a single goal.

Lillini goes with Adrian Aldrete at left-back over fellow former Mexican internationals Efrain Velarde and recent starter Jero Rodriguez. California-born Jorge Ruvalcaba could see a run-out on the wing at some point. The 21-year-old is a Mexican youth international and played college ball at Cal State San Bernardino less than two years ago.

Pumas starting lineup (4-3-3): J. Gonzalez (GK) — Aldrete Freire A. Ortiz Bennevendo — Lopez Meritao D. Alves — del Prete Dinenno Salvio.

Tyler was 30 years old a graduate of Dartmouth High School and Bridgewater State University when he took his own life in 2018.

His uncle Joel Baptista said Tyler's smile could light up a room but it was amazing how much that smile could hide.

""We saw some signs and help was provided but sometimes the pain is just too much and people can't see the light at the end of the tunnel"" Baptista said. ""We have a close-knit family but we just didn't know it would come to that.""

Jenelle Hickey is the coordinator of a program at Child and Family Services that assists young people at risk of suicide giving them the help they need to hopefully move forward.

Both Baptista and Hickey joined Townsquare Sunday this week to discuss suicide in our area.

Contributed Photo Contributed Photo loading...

After Tyler's death Baptista said his family decided to form a foundation to assist organizations working with young people on suicide prevention. That organization is Child and Family Services and Janelle Hickey's CBAT unit.

""We work with kids (ages) four to 17 who are in an acute mental health crisis"" Hickey said. ""That might mean depression anxiety or having suicidal thoughts and feelings.""

She said youngsters in the program stay about two weeks while personnel work on getting them to feel better.

CBAT currently has nine beds but it will grow to 15 when the program moves to the former Regal House building on Church Street sometime after the New Year. Hickey said her program is always full and sadly it's not uncommon for people at risk to have to wait for placement.

The Tyler Joseph Leonard Memorial Foundation will hold a fundraiser on September 10 from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. at the Allendale Country Club in Dartmouth. It will feature music dancing a silent auction and much more.

Proceeds from the event will fund a scholarship for a Dartmouth High School student and the CBAT program at Child and Family Services. For information and tickets visit thetylerjosephleonardmemorialfoundation.org.

Robert Ricciardi 87 and Gemma Ricciardi 85 are presumed dead after the inferno that consumed their mansion on Normandy Heights Road. Morris County Prosecutor Robert Carroll said the couple could not be found once fire crews brought the blaze under control.

Morris Township police and fire were alerted to the fire shortly before 3 a.m. early Friday morning. Carroll said that the intensity of the flames prevented several attempts by firefighters to enter and search for victims.

Helicopter video from CBS 2 New York showed the scope of the devastation. Almost the entire roof collapsed into the home.

Morris County Assistant Prosecutor Thomas Schmid said two victims' remains were pulled from the wreckage on Saturday afternoon. The Morris County Medical Examiner’s Office is working to confirm their identities.

MorristownGreen.com reported that Robert Ricciardi was the co-founder of the Ricciardi Brothers paint store chain. The couple's godson Tommy Casanola spoke with the local outlet later Friday.

“I have no words to say except they were the two greatest people in the world and they don’t make people like that anymore” Casanola said. “They will be in my heart forever. Mr. and Mrs. Ricciardi were the nicest people in the world.""

Investigators are still working to find the cause of the fire.

The U.S. retail industry is in a state of change. Consumers are increasingly shopping online favoring the convenience of delivery rather than taking a trip to a store. Many retailers are struggling to adapt having relied too heavily on malls for traffic. Some retail bankruptcies have already occurred and more are likely to follow as the trend toward Internet retail seems unstoppable.

Making matters even worse for brick-and-mortar retailers is the threat of the coronavirus and the related damage to the economy. Multiple large U.S. cities have been placed on lockdown virtually eliminating foot traffic to retailers. The uncertainty regarding when the coronavirus will end as well as the likelihood of a recession in the U.S. has caused many retail stocks to crash along with the broader stock market over the past several weeks.

With all this in mind we created a downloadable list of retail stocks along with important financial metrics such as price-to-earnings ratios and dividend yields.

But not all retailers are doomed. We still view many retail stocks favorably although investors must be selective and focus on stocks that offer a combination of value growth and/or dividends. Investors must also retain a long-term focus as the short-term will continue to be volatile for the retail industry.

Top Retail Stock #9: Big Lots (BIG)

5-year expected annual returns: 14.1%

Big Lots is a home discount retailer with a focus on closeouts and low prices. With $6 billion in sales and a market cap of around $930 million this S&P 600 component can trace its history to 1967.

Source: Investor Presentation

The company reported Q4 and full year 2021 results on March 3rd 2022 and announced a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share. With 2021 earnings of $5.33 per share and a forward annualized dividend of $1.20 the dividend is well covered by their existing business despite the decrease in earnings since 2020 where they reported $7.35 per share in earnings.

Despite a negative impact of around $0.30 per share as a result of adverse shrink and the issues with the supply chain that characterized 2021 the management team is confident that 2022 will see these issues abate. In 2022 the company plans on opening 50 net new stores more than they have in the past 5 years combined which should provide an opportunity for additional revenue growth.

Big Lots stock has a P/E below 5 making it a deep-value stock. Shares also have a dividend yield of 4.1% while we expect no EPS growth. Total returns are estimated at 14.1% over the next five years.

Top Retail Stock #8: Macy’s Inc. (M)

5-year expected annual returns: 14.3%

Macy’s is a department store company that operates brick and mortar stores as well as online stores under the Macy’s Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury brands. Macy’s was founded in 1929 and is headquartered in Cincinnati Ohio. The company owns highly valuable real estate such as the Herald square building in New York City.

Macy’s reported its fourth quarter earnings results on February 28. The company reported that its revenues totaled $8.7 billion during the quarter which was ahead of forecasts beating the consensus by $220 million. Macy’s revenues were up by 28% versus the previous year’s quarter which had seen a large pandemic impact.

The revenue increase can be explained by the easing impact of the coronavirus pandemic in Macy’s home market the US where economic reopening efforts allowed Macy’s to operate more freely compared to the comparable quarter from the previous year. The steep revenue increase resulted in a major margin improvement compared to the previous year’s quarter which is why the company managed to get its profitability up significantly.

Macy’s is also seeing strong growth due to its transformation into a multi-channel retailer.

Source: Investor Presentation

Macy’s generated earnings-per-share of $2.45 during the fourth quarter which was way better than what the analyst community had expected. 2020 was a weak year for the retailer as was expected due to the large impact the pandemic had on its business model. 2021 was a way stronger year for Macy’s again however. The company earned $5.31 per share on an adjusted basis which was the strongest result in the last decade.

Macy’s stock has a P/E of 4.2 making it a deep-value stock. Shares also have a dividend yield of 2.2% and we expect the company to grow its earnings-per-share by 1% per year. Total returns are estimated at 12.1% over the next five years.

Top Retail Stock #7: Ross Stores (ROST)

5-year expected annual returns: 14.7%

Ross Stores operates 1628 stores with off-price apparel and home fashion in 40 states. It also operates 295 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in 21 states and has a market cap of $33.6 billion. The retailer offers attractive merchandise at a 20%-60% discount compared to the regular prices of department and specialty stores.

In early March Ross Stores reported (3/1/22) financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Management compared the results to those of 2019 which it considers more representative of normal business conditions. Despite a surge in omicron variant cases just before Christmas and waning government fiscal stimulus same-store sales grew 9%.

However earnings-per-share dipped -19% over the 2019 quarter due to higher freight and labor costs as well as COVID related costs. Management raised the dividend by 8.8% but provided lackluster guidance for 2022 expecting earnings-per-share of $4.71-$5.12 mostly due to high inflation.

Ross Stores has recovered from the pandemic and thus it has reinstated its dividend its share repurchases and has resumed its growth plans. It also expects to enhance its market share significantly thanks to the large number of retail bankruptcies caused by the pandemic.

Top Retail Stock #6: Foot Locker (FL)

5-year expected annual returns: 15.0%

Foot Locker is an athletic apparel retailer that operates nearly 3000 stores in 27 countries. Foot Locker should generate about $8.9 billion in revenue this year.

Foot Locker reported fourth quarter and full-year earnings on February 25th 2022 and results were better than expected. However guidance was extremely weak missing estimates widely and the stock declined -30% on the day of the earnings release. Total revenue was $2.34 billion which was up 6.8% year-over-year.

This was due in part to a 0.8% comparable sales increase which was attributable to apparel “significantly” outpacing the core footwear segment. Earnings-per-share came to $1.67 in Q4 which was 21 cents ahead of estimates. For the year earnings came to $7.77 per share a new record by a wide margin.

The company guided for sales to decline by about -5% for 2022 with comparable sales growth of -9%. Square footage is expected to decline fractionally as stores are closed and gross margin is slated for 30.1% to 30.3%. Finally earnings-per-share is guided for $4.25 to $4.60.

The company also boosted its dividend by 33% to $0.40 per share quarterly. In addition the board authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $1.2 billion.

Top Retail Stock #4: Target Corporation (TGT)

5-year expected annual returns: 16.1%

Target was founded in 1902 and after a failed bid to expand into Canada has operations solely in the U.S. market. Its business consists of about 1850 big box stores which offer general merchandise and food as well as serving as distribution points for the company’s burgeoning e-commerce business.

Target reported first-quarter results on May 18th. Quarterly revenue of $25.17 billion beat analyst estimates by $688 million but earnings-per-share of $2.19 missed estimates by $0.87. Cost inflation led to the disappointing EPS figure.

We see continued comparable sales growth as driving results along with a small measure of margin expansion and a tailwind from the buyback. Target’s digital efforts are also working extremely nicely and the company’s small-format stores are performing very well opening a new avenue of growth for the company in the coming years. The remaining buyback authorization should be good for a significant tailwind to earnings-per-share in the coming years.

We expect 4% annual EPS growth through 2027. In addition the stock has a current dividend yield of 2.4%. Lastly the stock has a 2022 P/E of 10.4 below our fair value P/E of 18. Total returns are estimated at 16.1% per year over the next five years.

While bookstores are struggling to stay in business in an age of Kindles and e-books a comic bookstore stands out amidst the row of stores on Linking Road in Khar West. With an impressive collection — from Star Wars Marvel DC comics to Indie comics — this store has turned out to be a must-visit for comic book fans.

“When I was growing up there were no comic book stores around me. So instead of waiting for someone else to set up a specialised bookstore I chose to do it myself” said Hamza Sayyad the owner of the store.

The 25-year-old was the only comic book seller at Comic Con Mumbai in 2019. “We first started selling books from my living room. It was an online store operated by a single person one computer and with a small capital. All the comic books would lie around the room. During the lockdown our sales went up. We started getting orders from all over India. That encouraged me to open the store” he said.

The store which opened in March 2022 features a large selection of comics of different genres — horror time travel adventure among others. The store also sells rare collector’s items. “Our books are authentic since we source them directly from the distributors” Sayyad said.

With the iconic Stan Lee’s face adorning the facade the bold letters and bright yellow exteriors the store is hard to miss. Inside there are three walls of indie Marvel and DC comics with each wall dedicated to a specific genre. The top shelves have vintage issues and copies signed by notable comic book creators such as Stan Lee and Alex Ross.

The store also sells apparel and posters.

Running the book store however comes with its own set of challenges. Sayyad said “Comic books are susceptible to water and shipping damages.”

Occasionally the authentication certificate is removed during transit.

When questioned if pirated comic book sites are a threat Sayyad said “Piracy is a growing concern but very few titles are available online. If someone is pursuing a particular story they may not find all the issues online.”

He added that he was confident that a dedicated comic book reader will always prefer a physical copy to a pirated one.

The store has titles that will appeal to readers across age groups and they are reasonably priced. The starting price of comic books such as The Avengers Power Rangers and True Believers is Rs 99. Sought-after graphic novels such as Batman: The Killing Joke Watchmen (the international edition) Deathnote and others are priced at around Rs 1000.

Sayyad who has also opened a company called The Comic Book Store is working on introducing a monthly subscription service. This will provide digital comics to customers who do not have access to the store he said. He also plans to open a new store in Bangalore by the end of this year."

Two years later Cruise Industry News looks into the fate of the Spanish cruise line and its ships.

Pullmantur

While initially keeping part of its shore-based team and hoping to resume service with ships from other operators Pullmantur ended up being shut down last year.

Unable to secure financing for its return the cruise line was liquidated by its insolvency administrators in July 2021 – a year after first filing for reorganization.

According to the Spanish media the decision was also based on the pandemic developments which made it harder to preview when the company could resume regular operations around the world.

Sovereign

Year Built: 1988

Capacity: 2322 guests

Tonnage: 73192

Status: Scrapped in Aliaga Turkey

The Sovereign was one of the first ships to be beached for scrapping during the pandemic. As part of Pullmantur’s reorganization process the 1988-built vessel was returned to the Royal Caribbean Group before being sold to Turkish breakers.

In July 2020 just a few weeks after leaving the company’s fleet the ship arrived Aliaga Ship Breaking Yard for dismantling.

Horizon

Year Built: 1990

Capacity: 1442 guests

Tonnage: 47000

Status: Laid-up in Greece

Also returned to the Royal Caribbean Group during Pullmantur’s reorganization process the Horizon remained laid up in Greece.

Instead of joining its fleet mates at the Aliaga breakers as expected the vessel went to the Elefsis Bay where it remains anchored along with other cruise ships to this date.

Monarch

Year Built: 1991

Capacity: 2390 guests

Tonnage: 73941

Status: Scrapped in Aliaga Turkey

In a similar situation the Monarch arrived at the Aliaga Ship Breaking Yard along with the Sovereign.

Like its sister ship the former Monarch of the Seas was returned to the Royal Caribbean Group before being sold to Turkish scrapped in July 2020.

Zenith

Year Built: 1992

Capacity: 1441 guests

Tonnage: 47255

Status: Renamed TSM Singapore after two years laid up in Greece

After being sold to Peace Boat Organization in 2019 the Zenith left the Pullmantur fleet a few months before the company filed for reorganization. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic however the vessel never entered service for its new operators and instead spent nearly two years laid up in Greece.

In June 2022 the 1992-built ship was sold once again receiving the name TSM Singapore before sailing to Asia. Currently docked in Oman it still faces an uncertain future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vZG9taW5pY2FudG9kYXkuY29tL2RyL3RvdXJpc20vMjAyMi8wOC8wNy9yb3lhbC1jYXJpYmJlYW4tdmVyeS1zYXRpc2ZpZWQtd2l0aC10aGUtZG9taW5pY2FuLXJlcHVibGljcy1ib29zdC10by1jcnVpc2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Caribbean very “satisfied” with the Dominican Republic's boost to cruises,"The global director of port operations of Royal Caribbean Jaime Castillo expressed his satisfaction with the investments being made in the cruise sector in the Dominican Republic both in the northern part of the country as well as in the south with the project that will be initiated in Cabo Rojo Pedernales to provide a better experience for visitors.

He explained to arecoa.com that the industry would continue to grow because of the public-private sector’s referred investments. “The ship portfolio of the entire industry not only of us as Royal Caribbean Group has constancy and strength to continue with sustained growth in the coming years without stopping and the Dominican Republic will benefit from that.”

Castillo stressed that Royal Caribbean has interesting touches in the country which is why they maintain their bet that is consolidated with the upcoming arrival in Puerto Plata of one of the largest ships in the world the Oasis of the Seas.

“The cruise ship will touch port in the North zone at the end of this year 2022; in addition two of our brands both Celebrity Cruice and Royal Caribbean are touching the area of Puerto Plata Samaná and La Romana that is we have a very good presence on the island” he added.

He said that ultimately in Puerto Plata the arrival of their cruise ships will increase significantly and that in Samaná because of the reinvestment being made with the construction of the cruise port and tourist terminal “Samaná Bayport” as well.

“We have already visited Samaná we are one of the users of the port without the reinvestment and now with it I know that the experience of the cruise passengers will improve a lot and after the good comments that I trust we will be receiving from the service we will be able to increase the volume of visitors” he said.

As for customer satisfaction the executive said that it is “perfect and the more we remind the public areas visited by those tourists who are independent the experience will be much better since the Dominican Republic has many things to offer and everything a tourist is looking for we have it here it only remains to organize ourselves as a society to always offer the best to take advantage of the industry that is growing.”",,,,,,,,,

I want to be very clear here I am NOT advocating for driving over the speed limit. (65 all the way baby.) What I am saying is hypothetically if you are inclined to drive fast a good choice of vehicle would be something powerful yet subtle. Something practical but also well built and low key that does not immediately draw the attention of law enforcement. And also something fully electric because nothing makes you more incognito on the road than silence.

The Acura ZDX is that very something that ticks all of these boxes.

The first full electric from Acura the ZDX is a midsize crossover SUV that doesn’t immediately clock as a midsize crossover SUV. The lines are all low slung and the back end has a pleasing boxiness. The car is mostly blacked out from the beltline up giving the roof a floating appearance. It’s a bit luxe but equally understated.

MullenLowe The Acura ZDX.

It’s stylish but also practical. At its very practical heart the ZDX is built on GM’s Ultium platform a modular electric propulsion system that can be tweaked to fit a bunch of different vehicles from light trucks to cars to SUVs like the ZDX. Acura partnered with GM in the hopes it could fast track a fully electric entry without developing one from the ground up internally. You know what? It works. The battery tech feels mature with the ZDX getting around 300 miles of range per charge.

If there is one stat on the ZDX that is actually eye-catching it would have to be the 499 horsepower and and 544 lb-ft of torque of the Type S variants. The car also weighs in at over six thousand pounds yet it still rips—0-60mph is reached in 4.2 seconds. Things feel solid and predictable even after the speedometer starts creeping into the low triple digits – not that I would ever go that fast officer. Keep in mind this isn’t some autobahn thrashing import that you can comfortably take to a buck fifty without so much as a window rattle. The ZDX glides quickly and effortlessly from point to point but if you’re looking for something that can chew asphalt and rip through tight corners then you might have to switch to something fossil fuel powered like BMW’s X4 M or the unhinged Dodge Durango Hellcat.

Like virtually all electric vehicles the ZDX features regen braking which you can adjust through driving modes or on the steering wheel paddle. On the strongest setting the regen brakes are grabby enough to use one pedal driving. There are also standard brakes too – 15.3 inch front brake rotors! – but if you’re in regen braking mode they’ll hardly ever be used.

MullenLowe The illuminated front end of the ZDX.

The interior is spacious—far more than it looks on the outside—particularly in the cargo area which has a 28.7 cubic foot capacity. A number of car companies—looking at you BMW and Mercedes—have copied Tesla’s homework and eliminated virtually all physical buttons from their electric offerings. Look we’re assaulted by screens all day long and it’s nice to get into a ride and have the tactile pleasure of flicking an actual switch. The ZDX’s array of physical buttons knobs and switches for controlling everything from the entertainment to driving options to adaptive cruise control are a delight. The Type S variant also has Hands Free Cruise Acura's version of GM's Super Cruise hands-free driving tech which you can’t imagine living without if your commute has any semblance of traffic.

MullenLowe The Acura ZDX.

The ZDX occupies an interesting space. It’s a good—maybe great—alternative to the Tesla Model Y Mercedes EQB and BMW iX. It’s also quicker than most crossover electrics and somewhat stealthy—the CHP will definitely pull over the guy in the Ferrari Purosangue before he pulls over you in the ZDX. If you still find yourself itching for bigger thrills in an Acura maybe the best move would be to get something a little more fiery like one of their fun-as-hell Integra reissues. But if you’re looking for a reliable electric ride for people and cargo that delivers a good dosage of zoom the ZDX Type S is a very good bet.

""What a s--- show of a job you have!"" comedian Josh Ocean Thomas said in response.

Thomas a San Diego native who moved to the Midwest to pursue comedy shared a clip of the exchange during his recent set at The Laugh Factory in Chicago on Instagram earlier this week where it has gone viral.

""You work for the Biden administration? Is your job to wake him up or what’s your job?"" Ocean asked ""Nick"" as the audience erupted into laughter.

BIDEN VOWS TO WITHHOLD WEAPONS FROM ISRAEL IF NETANYAHU GOES FORWARD WITH RAFAH INVASION

Miming a fictional Biden staffer trying to get the president’s attention he exclaimed ""Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! There’s a war! Hey!""

The bit continued with Thomas asking Nick what he really does for Biden. Before he could respond the comic remarked ""What a s--- show of a job you have. I can’t believe you admitted that in front of all these people.""

""You have the freedom to lie. You could have said you were a hooker and I would’ve been prouder of you"" he added.

The alleged Biden staffer started to tell Thomas that he travels to southern states before the comic interrupted with a burst of laughter.

""That’s crazy! You go to the south and try to sell ‘em on Biden? You’re f----- r------! What the f---? What are you talking about?"" he said. ""That’s your f----- job? Is to go ‘Hey listen I know you guys like Trump but Biden. I mean…’""

BIDEN WARNS NETANYAHU AGAINST RAFAH INVASION AS ISRAEL PREPARES FOR ACTION

The clip ended with one last joke as Thomas asked ""Wow. Are you ready to be unemployed? Or what’s your vibe?""

Thomas captioned the video writing ""This was my only option.""

Thomas wasn't the only comic to take aim at Biden this week.

Anti-Trump comedian Michael Rapaport torched the president in a video he shared to X on Thursday in which he officially declared he would not be supporting Biden’s re-election after the world leader told CNN he would not send weapons to Israel if it invades Rafah Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza.

""Smoking Joe Biden. Cadaver Joe Biden. I never thought I would say this. I'm not voting for you. You're not getting my vote"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3Jmay1qcnMtdnAtcGljay1uaWNvbGUtc2hhbmFoYW4tdHJpZXMtdG8tc2hha2Utb2ZmLWRhaWx5LWJlYXN0LXN0b3J50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RFK Jr.'s VP Pick Nicole Shanahan Says She's 'Hurt' by Daily Beast Story,"Nicole Shanahan who ignored repeated requests for comment on a Daily Beast story about her astonishing ascent to become Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s running mate complained on Thursday that she was “slandered” and had to “take a walk to shake it off.”

Shanahan who has been bankrolling RFK Jr.’s spoiler-ready campaign for president with the fortune she got in her divorce from Google founder Sergey Brin did not raise any specific objection to the story which she said she didn’t read until nearly a full day after it was published.

But she did go into detail about an almost cinematic encounter she had on her walk when she “pulled into a farmers market to say hello to the farmers.”

“I walked by a young man on the empty side of the parking lot who recognized me and said ‘Nicole Shanahan!’ and said he was a supporter of Bobby and watched my speech” she wrote on X.

“He said he studied the psychology of politics in college. I told him about the article and how I was trying to walk it off. He told me he had watched the ‘Who is Bobby Kennedy’ film which is specifically about how cruel and embarrassingly desperate the left-wing media can be.”

“He’s 23 years old. I looked up at the sky and then said to this young man ‘thank you you are just what I needed in this moment to keep going strong.’ His name is Alex. Thank you Alex.”

The Daily Beast reached out to the Kennedy campaign after her post but did not get an immediate response. The Daily Beast could not reach Alex because no last name was provided but he can contact us at tips@thedailybeast.com at any time.

The story that Shanahan appeared to be referring to detailed her meteoric rise from a turbulent childhood in Oakland California to the wife—and then ex-wife—of one of the richest men in the country as well as the running mate of a conspiracy theory-driven third-party presidential candidate who could hand the election to Donald Trump.

The Beast story the result of more than a dozen interviews and several weeks of work was highlighted by top tech journalist Kara Swisher on Threads on Thursday. In particular Swisher noted that a source who has spent significant time with Shanahan scoffed at Kennedy’s description of her as an artificial intelligence expert with the source saying that she “couldn’t differentiate ‘AI from a tennis ball.’”

Swisher then went on to add “And more: Unsuccessful entrepreneur losing lawyer bloviating nonsense on all manner of things she has no expertise in marriage incompetence and she’s just plainly a candidate for a thirsty wack job because she managed to get a pile of money from a tech billionaire who wanted her to go away.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvcmZrLWpyLWphY2stc2NobG9zc2JlcmcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Using Cartoonish Accents J.F.K.'s Grandson Insults and Mocks Robert F.

All while Helium's revenue decline to $6.5k/month.

Helium is in trouble this week after multiple companies said they were listed as use cases on Helium’s site even though they were not using Helium. Helium is a blockchain project that works as a decentralized user-powered wireless network. It’s like a mesh net competitor to typical internet providers which incentivizes users to run nodes providing network availability via their HNT token.

The recent scandal for Helium came when both Salesforce and Lime companies whose icons were listed under Helium’s active partners section said they had no current relationships with Helium. Lime said they had taken part in an initial test back in 2019 but Salesforce simply said they didn’t have any partnership.

In response Heliums CEO Amir Haleem put out a series of tweets explaining the shape some of these partnerships take which may have led Helium to misunderstand the current state of their relationships with these companies. “We've worked with companies big and small over the years. Lots of these engagements are pilots and trials sometimes they turn into bigger applications and sometimes they don’t. […] Some of the users on the network we know about and some we don’t that’s the nature of having a permissionless network that anyone can use. “

Haleem’s stance was that he received verbal approval for this type of marketing but with people constantly changing roles verbal approval was no longer enough. Haleem said they would no longer list companies that haven’t given written approval–the company removed only Lime and Salesforce. In my view it’s hard to imagine that Helium just didn’t realize the two largest companies they touted as partners weren’t using their network.

Is Helium a Good Investment?

Helium has raised $365M with top venture capital firm a16z as the lead investor and an estimated $250M has been spent by retail investors on hotspot nodes. Most of those nodes were purchased for hundreds to thousands of dollars at a time when node operators were making roughly $100/month. That’s changed.

Now the average node makes about $20/month and some users are reporting far lower earnings. If you go to Helium’s subreddit you’ll find an endless stream of people posting about rates being cut and some recently saying they’re not earning any rewards.

That’s just the current state of the network. Within the next 12 months the rewards will be cut in half again and there are a number of backordered miners that will be coming online as orders are fulfilled. That means node operator rewards likely are only going down from here.

Outside of obscure DeFi projects it’s rare that I see a project with worse economics than Helium. With all of this money spent Helium has managed to generate a whopping $6500 a month in revenue. The payout to node operators is a combination of subsidies by venture capital investor money and dilutive minting of the underlying token like so many crypto project rewards are.

Many of the details for this article were based on Liron Shapira’s Twitter thread breaking down Helium’s financials.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMDYvYnVzaW5lc3MvaW5kaWFuYS1jb21wYW5pZXMtYWJvcnRpb24uaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eli Lilly and Other Major Indiana Employers Criticize Abortion Ban,"On Friday the governor of Indiana signed into law a near-total abortion ban making the state the first to approve sweeping new restrictions since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June.

On Saturday morning one of Indiana’s biggest employers the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly issued a strong objection to the new restrictions. “Given this new law” it said in a statement “we will be forced to plan for more employment growth outside our home state.”

The company which employs more than 10000 people in Indiana began by saying that “abortion is a divisive and deeply personal issue with no clear consensus among the citizens of Indiana.” It noted that Eli Lilly has expanded its employee health plan coverage to include travel for reproductive services. But it added “that may not be enough for some current and potential employees.”

It was among the first major employers in the state to weigh in on the new law.

Shortly after Jon Mills a spokesman for Cummins an engine company that employs about 10000 people in the state said: “The right to make decisions regarding reproductive health ensures that women have the same opportunity as others to participate fully in our work force and that our work force is diverse. There are provisions in the bill that conflict with this impact our people and impede our ability to attract and retain top talent.” He added that Cummins’s health care benefits cover elective reproductive health procedures including medical travel benefits.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA4LzA2L3ByZWRpY3Rpb24tdGhlc2Utd2lsbC1iZS0xMC1sYXJnZXN0LXN0b2Nrcy1ieS0yMDMwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Prediction: These Will Be the 10 Largest Stocks by 2030,"Change is common on Wall Street and there could be a major shake-up among the largest stocks by the turn of the decade.

For more than a century Wall Street has been a wealth-building machine for those who are patient. Over long periods high-quality companies and the indexes they're a part of tend to increase in value.

Something else that's commonplace on Wall Street is change. It's perfectly normal for innovation acquisitions competitive advantages and other factors to shake up the world's largest publicly traded companies on a fairly regular basis.

Just 18 years ago companies like General Electric AIG and Intel were among the 10 largest publicly traded companies by market cap. As of Aug. 4 Intel wasn't even in the top 50 any longer while GE and AIG had fallen out of the top 125 and top 250 respectively. Eight years from now in 2030 the stock market's 10 largest stocks could look vastly different than they do today.

While absolutely nothing is set in stone I predict that the following 10 stocks will have the largest market caps by 2030. Note that these 10 companies aren't listed in any particular order.

1. Berkshire Hathaway

The first stock conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.61%) (BRK.B 0.60%) should retain its spot in the top 10 even if billionaire CEO Warren Buffett isn't at the helm come 2030. After overseeing an average annual return on the company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of 20.1% since 1965 Buffett has clearly shown he's set his company up for long-term success.

One factor that makes Berkshire Hathaway such an incredible company is the mountain of passive income it collects every year. Over the next 12 months Buffett's company is expected to bring in well over $6 billion in dividend income with $4.25 billion coming from just a handful of companies. Because dividend stocks have a long history of outperforming nondividend payers holding these time-tested companies for years or decades provides an added boost.

2. Apple

Perhaps the least-surprising prediction is that the largest publicly traded company in the U.S. Apple (AAPL 1.00%) will remain in the top 10 largest stocks by market cap by 2030.

Aside from an easily recognized brand name and faithful customer base Apple's innovation is key to its success. Introducing a 5G-capable iPhone quickly pushed up its market share in the U.S. while CEO Tim Cook is busy leading a multiyear transition that emphasizes subscription services. Ultimately subscriptions should boost Apple's operating margins and lessen the sales volatility witnessed during product replacement cycles.

Apple has also repurchased $520 billion worth of its own common stock since the beginning of 2013. If this aggressive buyback program continues value investors are likely to continue plowing into Apple.

3. Visa

Payment processor Visa (V 0.49%) currently finds itself on the outside looking in (No. 11). By the turn of the decade I expect it to firmly find itself as one of the 10 largest companies by market cap.

Visa's opportunity for expansion is enormous. Most global transactions are still being conducted in cash which means it can expand organically into underbanked regions such as the Middle East Africa and Southeastern Asia or lean on acquisitions to grow (e.g. the Visa Europe buyout in 2016). Sustained double-digit annual growth should be the expectation throughout the decade.

What's more Visa strictly sticks to payment processing. Although the company would probably do just fine as a lender it would also expose Visa to potential loan delinquencies and losses during recessions. By avoiding lending Visa is able to bounce back from economic downturns faster than its peers and maintain a profit margin above 50%.

4. Alphabet

Another FAANG stock that has an exceptionally high likelihood of retaining its top-10 ranking by market cap come 2030 is Alphabet (GOOGL 0.34%) (GOOG 0.24%) the parent company of internet search engine Google and streaming platform YouTube.

Google has long been Alphabet's foundational operating segment. Over the past two years it's handled no less than 91% of global internet search share a big reason why Alphabet sports such incredible ad-pricing power. As traffic acquisition costs decline over time Google should continue to be a cash cow for the company.

But Alphabet's future is about its higher-growth initiatives like YouTube and Google Cloud. YouTube has grown into the second-most-visited social site in the world while Google Cloud has gobbled up 8% of global cloud infrastructure spending.

5. Salesforce

Cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software provider Salesforce (CRM -1.36%) could make one of the biggest leaps (currently No. 43) in terms of market cap by 2030. CRM software is what's used to help businesses enhance customer relationships and boost sales.

Global CRM software sales are expected to sustain double-digit growth through at least mid-decade which is great news for the industry's unquestioned leader. According to IDC Salesforce commanded a 23.8% share of CRM software spending in 2021 (over four times its next-closest competitor).

In addition to its commanding market share co-CEO and co-founder Marc Benioff has a penchant for making earnings-accretive acquisitions. These deals broaden the Salesforce ecosystem and help with the company's cross-selling opportunities.

6. Amazon

E-commerce stock Amazon (AMZN 0.80%) is another really strong bet to retain its spot in among the 10 largest stocks by the turn of the decade.

Most folks know Amazon for its industry-leading online marketplace. In 2022 eMarketer projects that Amazon will account for 39.5% of all U.S. online retail sales. But the real crown jewel is the more than 200 million Prime members who've signed up as a result of its leading marketplace. The fees collected from Prime members help Amazon expand its logistics network and reinvest in high-growth initiatives.

There's also Amazon Web Services (AWS) which is the global No. 1 in cloud infrastructure spending with 33% market share. Corporate cloud spending is still in its early innings which means Amazon's operating cash flow could skyrocket in the years ahead.

7. PayPal Holdings

The company I predict will make the biggest leap into the top 10 stocks by market cap is fintech giant PayPal Holdings (PYPL 1.00%). PayPal is currently No. 88 with a $112 billion market cap.

Digital payments are still in their infancy which bodes well for fee-based payment platforms. Even with U.S. gross domestic product declining in back-to-back quarters PayPal's total payment volume on its network continues to grow by a double-digit percentage on a constant-currency basis.

Arguably even more important active users are more engaged than ever. At the end of 2020 active users were completing 40.9 transactions over the trailing 12 months (ttm). This figure is up to 48.7 transactions per active account on a ttm basis through June 2022 and it continues to climb.

8. Microsoft

Software kingpin Microsoft (MSFT 0.43%) the only company from the 10 largest stocks by market cap in 1999 to still have a top-10 position today has a good shot at sustaining its dominance throughout the decade.

Microsoft's success is a function of raking in mammoth amounts of cash flow from its legacy operations and funneling this cash into faster-growing projects. For instance even though its high-margin Windows franchise is generally a slow grower it still accounts for a 76% share of global desktop operating systems.

Microsoft is utilizing this cash flow to reinvest in a variety of cloud initiatives -- Azure is the global No. 2 in cloud infrastructure spending and grew sales by 46% on a constant-currency basis in the June-ended quarter -- and fuel acquisitions. For instance Microsoft offered $68.7 billion to acquire gaming company Activision Blizzard in January.

9. Chevron

Despite a feverish renewable energy push by most developed countries I predict oil and gas major Chevron (CVX 1.79%) will find its way into 10 largest publicly traded companies by market cap in 2030.

The biggest reason for this push is the expectation that oil and natural gas prices will remain elevated for many years to come. The pandemic resulted in multiple years of reduced domestic and international drilling and pipeline investment. Couple this with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and you'll see there's a clear risk to global energy supply.

Chevron is also in excellent financial shape compared to most other integrated oil stocks. By prudently deploying its capital and minimizing debt Chevron has been able to maintain its superior dividend repurchase its own stock and fund key natural gas projects in the Asia-Pacific region.

10. Meta Platforms

Lastly social media stock Meta Platforms (META 0.60%) the company formerly known as Facebook should find itself as one of the 10 largest stocks in 2030. You'll note that current top-10 stocks Tesla (TSLA -1.57%) UnitedHealth Group (UNH 0.76%) Nvidia (NVDA -1.84%) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 0.60%) didn't make the cut.

Although social media usage statistics can be extremely fickle to project one year in advance let alone in eight years Meta has four of the most downloaded apps in the world. On a combined basis Facebook Instagram WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger attracted 3.65 billion monthly active users in the June-ended quarter. That's over half the global adult population and a big reason why Facebook's ad-pricing power is exceptionally strong more often than not.

The wild card is the company's metaverse ambitions the ""metaverse"" being the next iteration of the internet that allows connected users to interact with each other and their surroundings in a 3D virtual environment. It will be years before the necessary infrastructure is in place to support the metaverse. But once there Meta's hefty investments could make it a key player in this potentially $30 trillion opportunity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzA2L2ZhdXhwaWxvdF9naXRodWJfY29waWxvdC_SAURodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vQU1QLzIwMjIvMDgvMDYvZmF1eHBpbG90X2dpdGh1Yl9jb3BpbG90Lw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FauxPilot: It's like GitHub Copilot but doesn't phone home to Microsoft,"Updated GitHub Copilot one of several recent tools for generating programming code suggestions with the help of AI models remains problematic for some users due to licensing concerns and to the telemetry the software sends back to the Microsoft-owned company.

So Brendan Dolan-Gavitt assistant professor in the computer science and engineering department at NYU Tandon in the US has released FauxPilot an alternative to Copilot that runs locally without phoning home to the Microsoft mothership.

Copilot relies on OpenAI Codex a natural language-to-code system based on GPT-3 that was trained on ""billions of lines of public code"" in GitHub repositories. That has made advocates of free and open source software (FOSS) uncomfortable because Microsoft and GitHub have failed to specify exactly which repositories informed Codex.

As Bradley Kuhn policy fellow at the Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC) wrote in a blog post earlier this year ""Copilot leaves copyleft compliance as an exercise for the user. Users likely face growing liability that only increases as Copilot improves. Users currently have no methods besides serendipity and educated guesses to know whether Copilot’s output is copyrighted by someone else.""

Shortly after GitHub Copilot became commercially available the SFC urged open-source maintainers not to use GitHub in part due to its refusal to address concerns about Copilot.

Not a perfect world

FauxPilot doesn't use Codex. It relies on Salesforce's CodeGen model. However that's unlikely to appease FOSS advocates because CodeGen was also trained using public open-source code without regard to the nuances of different licenses.

""The models that it's using right now are ones that were trained by Salesforce and they were again trained basically on all of GitHub public code"" explained Dolan-Gavitt in a phone interview with The Register. ""So there are some issues still there potentially with licensing that wouldn't be resolved by this.

""On the other hand if someone with enough compute power came along and said 'I'm going to train a model that's only trained on GPL code or has a license that lets me reuse it without attribution' or something like that then they could train their model drop that model into FauxPilot and use that model instead.""

For Dolan-Gavitt the primary goal of FauxPilot is to provide a way to run the AI assistance software on-premises.

""There are people who have privacy concerns or maybe in the case of work some corporate policies that prevent them from sending their code to a third-party and that definitely is helped by being able to run it locally"" he explained.

GitHub in its description of what data Copilot collects describes an option to disable the collection of Code Snippets Data which includes ""source code that you are editing related files and other files open in the same IDE or editor URLs of repositories and files paths.""

But doing so does not appear to disable the gathering of User Engagement Data – ""user edit actions like completions accepted and dismissed and error and general usage data to identify metrics like latency and features engagement"" and potentially ""personal data such as pseudonymous identifiers.""

Dolan-Gavitt said he sees FauxPilot as a research platform.

""One thing that we want to do is train code models that hopefully output more secure code"" he explained. ""And once we do that we'll want to be able to test them and maybe even test them with actual users using something like Copilot but with our own models. So that was kind of motivation.""

Doing so however has some challenges. ""At the moment it's somewhat impractical to try and create a dataset that doesn't have any security vulnerabilities because the models are really data hungry"" said Dolan-Gavitt.

""So they want lots and lots of code to train on. But we don't have very good or foolproof ways of ensuring that code is bug free. So it would be an immense amount of work to try and curate a data set that was free of security vulnerabilities.""

Nonetheless Dolan-Gavitt who co-authored a paper on the insecurity of Copilot code suggestions finds AI assistance useful enough to stick with it.

""My personal feeling on this is I've had Copilot turned on basically since it came out last summer"" he explained. ""I do find it really useful. That said I do kind of have to double check its work. But often it's often easier for me at least to start with something that it gives me and then edit it into correctness than to try to create it from scratch."" ®

Updated to add

Dolan-Gavitt has warned us that if you use FauxPilot with the official Visual Studio Code Copilot extension the latter will still send telemetry though not code completion requests to GitHub and Microsoft.

""Once we have our own VSCode extension working ... that issue will be solved"" he said. This custom extension needs to be updated now that the InlineCompletion API has been finalized by the Windows giant.

So essentially the base FauxPilot doesn't phone home to Redmond though if you want a completely non-Microsoft experience you'll have to grab the project's extension when it's ready if you're using FauxPilot with Visual Studio Code.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvaS1tLW92ZXItdGhlLW1vb24tdGhhdC1saW5kYS1pcy1oYXZpbmctYS1iYWJ5LXRvby1ucXBjdHA3djbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kathryn and Linda Thomas: 'We're each other's closest confidantes',"When they were single in their thirties Kathryn Thomas and her sister Linda rolled their eyes every time someone assured them that they would “know” when the right person came along.

Albert ""Tino"" Ortega is one of 21 artists tasked with creating a portrait of one of the victims.

”I was invited a couple of months ago to go out to Uvalde and be a part of this project where we will be painting portraits of the victims so 21 artists from all over texas were selected"" said Ortega.

RECOMMENDED:P

Ortega and the other artists donated their time and skills to make this project come to life.

""A lot of the materials are being donated through amenities like Sherwin Williams"" he added ""I’m sponsoring some of the paint material myself so this is all coming out of pocket so I’m just glad that I’m able to give back in that aspect.""

Using art to help grieving families is something Tino Ortega is familiar with.

Following the August 3 shooting in El Paso Ortega created several ballon murals to help uplift the community during a dark time.

""All the art projects that have been popping up here it does bring a sense of healing it doesn’t make everything better but it definitely does help with the grieving process"" said Ortega.

While he’s nervous to be working on this project he is glad to be giving back to the community.

“It makes me a little nervous you know you want to go there and have the best intentions you want to do a good job not for yourself but for other individuals. You want to make sure that they’re represented in a way that their families will remember them"" said Ortega.

He hopes his work pays homage to the victims.

Tyler was 30 years old a graduate of Dartmouth High School and Bridgewater State University when he took his own life in 2018.

His uncle Joel Baptista said Tyler's smile could light up a room but it was amazing how much that smile could hide.

""We saw some signs and help was provided but sometimes the pain is just too much and people can't see the light at the end of the tunnel"" Baptista said. ""We have a close-knit family but we just didn't know it would come to that.""

Jenelle Hickey is the coordinator of a program at Child and Family Services that assists young people at risk of suicide giving them the help they need to hopefully move forward.

Both Baptista and Hickey joined Townsquare Sunday this week to discuss suicide in our area.

After Tyler's death Baptista said his family decided to form a foundation to assist organizations working with young people on suicide prevention. That organization is Child and Family Services and Janelle Hickey's CBAT unit.

""We work with kids (ages) four to 17 who are in an acute mental health crisis"" Hickey said. ""That might mean depression anxiety or having suicidal thoughts and feelings.""

She said youngsters in the program stay about two weeks while personnel work on getting them to feel better.

CBAT currently has nine beds but it will grow to 15 when the program moves to the former Regal House building on Church Street sometime after the New Year. Hickey said her program is always full and sadly it's not uncommon for people at risk to have to wait for placement.

The Tyler Joseph Leonard Memorial Foundation will hold a fundraiser on September 10 from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. at the Allendale Country Club in Dartmouth. It will feature music dancing a silent auction and much more.

Proceeds from the event will fund a scholarship for a Dartmouth High School student and the CBAT program at Child and Family Services. For information and tickets visit thetylerjosephleonardmemorialfoundation.org.

That same report revealed that a third of online U.K. consumer transactions used a mobile wallet which also accounted for 18% of in-store payments.

And yet as the latest PYMNTS Digital Shopping Playbook reveals the cross-channel or hybrid approach to retail that uses mobile devices to enhance and assist in-store shopping is not as widespread in the U.K. as it is in other countries.

The research found that British shoppers use smartphones 16% less than consumers in other countries to enhance their in-store shopping experiences. This represents an odd anomaly in a country that is typically very open to mobile technology.

AR and Physical Retail: A Promising Avenue for Commerce

While the growth of smartphone-enhanced shopping appears to have plateaued in the U.K. that hasn’t stopped the country’s pioneering retailers from forging ahead with one innovation in mobile ShopTech: augmented reality (AR).

When Apple opened a new flagship store in London last month it celebrated the launch with an AR experience that focuses on London poet and painter William Blake created for Getty Museum using Apple’s technology.

The collaboration is another example of Apple’s ongoing interest in AR as stated on its U.K. website: “Apple has the world’s largest AR platform with hundreds of millions of AR‑enabled devices as well as thousands of AR apps on the App Store. And because Apple hardware and software are designed from the ground up for AR there is no better way to experience it.”

Apple is not the only company using AR to enhance the in-store retail experience in the U.K. Some notable examples include the high-end department store Harrods which used AR technology in its Christmas 2021 window displays as well as the global pioneer in AR-powered in-store fun — Lego — which has run a number of AR campaigns over the years.

That said there are other ways besides AR that U.K. consumers are being prodded to embrace mobile devices in their brick-and-mortar shopping.

Apple’s new London store is also home to the U.K.’s first Apple Pickup area which allows customers to order products online and have them waiting at the store. Here too The Digital Shopping Playbook found that the U.K. lags behind other countries in the adoption of in-store collection with U.K. consumers being 8x more likely to use delivery than in-store pick up.

Ultimately smartphone-assisted shopping is still in its infancy. Despite sluggish adoption in the U.K. there are promising signs that technologies like AR will be able to further excite consumers and stimulate their usage of mobile devices in physical retail.

In fact research by Bazaarvoice found that 48% of U.K. consumers want to see AR/virtual reality (VR) in physical stores — but how AR will be applied to in-store retail in the future remains unclear.

In the parallel world of eCommerce however many apps and websites now offer AR “virtual fitting rooms” that allow users to try out items using augmented reality. Likewise companies like Ikea use AR to help people envisage what home furnishings will look like in their rooms before they buy.

These kinds of use cases offer a glimpse at what the future of AR in physical retail may look like.

While Apple’s Harrods’ and Lego’s mobilizations of the technology are entertaining they don’t have the same practical implications on the way people shop as AR has had in eCommerce. Nevertheless as AR is increasingly utilized in all areas of retail it will likely continue to play an increasing role in brick-and-mortar shopping.

Two-Buck Chuck. Simple Truth. Cat & Jack. Great Value. Amazon Basics. Store brands have never been more popular.

They have become forces in their own right and make up around 21% of sales in the $1.7 trillion US grocery industry according to IRI.

As prices surge store brands — also known as private labels white labels or generic brands — have become an even more attractive option for inflation-fatigued shoppers who are looking to switch from pricier name brands. Store brands can be anywhere from 10% to 50% cheaper.

But the origins of store brands remain largely secretive.

Retailers aren't typically forthcoming about the companies that make their brands. And manufacturers likewise have little incentive to reveal that they're creating similar products to their name brands under a different label sold on the cheap.

Many leading national brand manufacturers create private labels for multiple retailers. In the late 1990s more than half of brand manufacturers were estimated to make private goods as well.

Although store brands ostensibly compete with manufacturers' national brands manufacturers often have excess capacity on their production lines. To generate additional profit some will use that extra capacity to make private labels.

Other brand manufacturers will produce private labels as an incentive for retailers hoping they'll be rewarded with better shelf space and placement for their own national labels.

""Most manufacturers aren't open about it"" said Jan-Benedict E.M. Steenkamp a marketing professor at the University of North Carolina who studies private labels and branding. ""Manufacturers don't want it to be known because it undermines the power of their own brands.""

But there are some exceptions. Kimberly-Clark the maker of Huggies diapers produces Kirkland Signature diapers for Costco and Duracell produces Kirkland Signature batteries Costco executives have said.

Georgia-Pacific the maker of Brawny and Dixie also produces store brands. So does Henkel the manufacturer of Purex and Dial.

Eight O'Clock Coffee and Kenmore

Store labels have been around since the early days of retail and the emergence of consumer brands in the 19th century.

Macy's sold stoneware whiskey jugs under its own name. Customers could bring back the jugs for refills according to Christopher Durham the president of the Velocity Institute a trade association for private brands.

Montgomery Ward developed its own line of aspirin in wooden containers while the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. (aka A&P) sold branded spices with the slogan ""Take the Grandmother's Advice Use A&P Spices."" A&P later developed Eight O'Clock Coffee one of the most famous private labels of the period.

Yet no US retailer was more successful developing its own brands than Sears Roebuck.

In 1925 Sears created the Allstate brand for car tires. A few years later Sears launched its first Craftsman wrench according to Durham. Its Kenmore line which started as a sewing machine brand in 1913 before branching into vacuums and other home appliances became the leading home appliance brand in the United States.

These private labels were the exception however.

For most of the 20th century national brands such as Jell-O H.J. Heinz Campbell Soup and Johnson & Johnson had power over stores. These manufacturers flooded the airwaves and newspapers with advertisements extolling the advantages of their products.

Most customers were fiercely loyal to specific brands not retailers. A store that didn't carry major labels would likely get crushed which gave manufacturers immense leverage.

Additionally many store brands were also considered dull cheap knockoffs of national brands.

The low point of private label came during the 1970s Durham said when stores seeking to cut costs and rolled out generics with basic white backgrounds and black letters identifying the product -- beer soap cola beans and other staples.

Shopper loyalty

Retailers make private label brands for a variety of reasons including to boost profitability and sometimes as a negotiating tool against brands.

Private brands often carry profit margins that are 20% to 40% higher than national brands because stores don't have to pay the advertising distribution or other markup costs that are embedded in major brands' prices.

In the mid-20th century many retailers started to develop their own labels to claw back bargaining power from dominant suppliers and keep their prices in check. As the US retail industry has consolidated in recent decades the power dynamic between retailers and suppliers reversed. Now stores have more leverage to introduce their own labels -- whether name brands like it or not.

""Forty years ago Walmart pissing off P&G would be a risky situation. Now Walmart is much bigger than P&G"" said Steenkamp the marketing professor.

Today stores' private brand operations are more sophisticated than ever and a much bigger focus for chains.

Stores are likelier these days to develop a distinctive private brand or product to stand out against competitors and create shopper loyalty said Krishnakumar Davey the president of client engagement at IRI.

Costco for example will decide to make a Kirkland Signature product because a leading brand won't sell to the retailer. Or Costco believes the name brand's prices have gotten too high and it can make its own similar-quality product and sell it for 20% less.

Costco hasn't lost any relationships with suppliers by launching its own Kirkland products but those brands are not usually pleased when Costco introduces one company CFO Richard Galanti said in an interview earlier this year.

Retailers have been sued for creating products that too closely resemble national brands. The owner of golf ball-brand Titleist sued Costco for patent infringement while Williams-Sonoma sued Amazon for selling ""knockoffs"" under its own brand. Both cases were settled.

The US House Judiciary Committee and other lawmakers and regulators around the world have investigated whether Amazon uses data from sellers to create its own brands and unlawfully favors its own brands on its website.

Amazon has said it doesn't use the data from individual third-party sellers to inform the development of its own private brands and does not favor its own products on the site.

Most stores start small with their own brands. Grocers for example will often first introduce a shelf-stable product like pasta flour sugar or rice that's easier to make and where brand loyalty within the category isn't strong.

""You don't start with the most difficult things"" Steenkamp said. ""As stores build more experience and success then they enter new categories.""

How to find out who makes store brands

So how do you tell who's behind your favorite store brands?

Product recalls are often the most revealing way to find out which brand manufacturers are behind specific private labels.

Last year for example Dole recalled fresh salads and vegetables including private brands for Walmart Kroger and H-E-B.

J.M. Smucker recalled certain Jif peanut butter products this year as well as store-branded items it made for Giant Eagle Wawa and Safeway. Large companies such as Conagra and McCain Foods have recalled products from Trader Joe's.

Then there are the dedicated private label manufacturers such as Treehouse Foods which makes snacks under the labels of supermarkets big-box chains and other retailers. Nearly one-quarter of the company's $4.3 billion in sales last year for example came from Walmart.

James Walser who led the launch of Target's up & up household basics and personal care brand in 2009 said that Target tried to move away from national brand manufacturers during up & up's development to nimbler suppliers focused solely on making private labels.

Some large retailers also make their own private labels. Kroger for example makes about 30% of its own private products.

Perhaps the strangest store brand manufacturers are retailers that make private brands for their ... competitors: Safeway-owned Lucerne Foods manufactures private labels for Safeway's rivals.

Smucker confident it can raise prices in the year ahead,"ORRVILLE OHIO – Retailers such as Target Corp. and Walmart Inc. have implied recently the continual acceptance of price hikes by food and beverage companies to offset inflation is coming to an end. But executives with the J.M. Smucker Co. expressed confidence in their ability to raise prices if necessary in the months ahead.

“We have generally taken a majority of the pricing across our portfolio thus far in anticipation of our costs that we would incur this fiscal year” said Mark T. Smucker president and chief executive officer during a June 7 conference call to discuss fiscal 2022 results. “There may be additional pricing actions that are required depending on costs and inputs and so forth.

“And our confidence derives from the fact that we continue to have very strong relationships with our retail customers and that we really approach any meaningful cost increases very judiciously and really work to partner with our customers and have very open dialogue as we move forward. So again this is part of our business. It’s our job and we want to manage through it in the most positive way possible. So we remain confident.”

Mr. Smucker supported his argument by noting the company saw “elasticity coming in better than expected” during the fiscal year.

“That trend has continued” he said. “We are modeling going forward some elasticity. We really are in categories that are pretty resilient and our offerings (in) those categories are focused on a variety of value propositions... So we just feel that we’re very well positioned in this environment and just will continue to execute our strategy.”

Net income at J.M. Smucker in the year ended April 30 was $631.7 million equal to $5.84 per share on the common stock and down from fiscal 2021 when the company earned $876.3 million or $7.79 per share.

Fiscal 2022 sales of $7.99 billion were flat compared with fiscal 2021 when sales were $8 billion.

In US Retail Pet Foods Smucker’s largest business unit sales fell slightly in fiscal 2022 to $2.76 billion from $2.84 billion the year before. Pet Food profit fell to $396 million from $487 million. Items affecting Pet Food performance included divestiture of Natural Balance and a private label dry pet food business.

US Retail Coffee sales rose during the year to $2.48 billion from $2.37 billion. Business unit profit was relatively flat coming in at $738 million in fiscal 2022 and down from $769 million the year before.

“Coffee habits formed during the pandemic continue and at-home consumption remains elevated” Mr. Smucker said. “At-home consumption now represents over 70% of all coffee drinking occasions compared to two-thirds pre-pandemic. We are well positioned to benefit from these trends with a portfolio that provides consumers options ranging from value to premium offerings.”

US Retail Consumer Foods sales fell to $1.7 billion from $1.8 billion the year before. Business unit profit was $424 million down from $473 million in fiscal 2021.

International and Away From Home unit sales rose to $1 billion from $948 million the year before. Segment profit ticked up to $142 million in fiscal 2022 from $124 million in fiscal 2021.

The company is guiding fiscal 2023 net sales will rise between 3.5% to 4.5% compared with fiscal 2022.

“This reflects benefits from higher net pricing actions across our portfolio primarily to recover increased commodity and ingredient and transportation and packaging costs” said Tucker H. Marshall chief financial officer. “Net sales growth also reflects increased volume/mix for the Uncrustables brand and continued momentum in away from home channels.”

Full-year adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in a range of $7.85 to $8.25.

Nudi group vice president North American Retail.

Nudi participated in a question-and-answer discussion about the General Mills business June 1 as part of the RBC Capital Markets Consumer and Retail Conference. Conducting the Q&A was Sunil Modi RBC’s lead consumer analyst.

“We’re seeing 10 times the number of disruptions in our supply chain from an ingredient standpoint coming into our plans than we ever experienced before” Nudi said. “And this gets really challenging because we can’t see them coming in many cases. So a truck is supposed to show up with oil at our refrigerated dough plant in Tennessee and doesn’t show up. So we have to shut the line down. Obviously that creates lots of issues in terms of having the right amount of product and supply to our customers. And at the same time it drives a lot of incremental costs as well. So we have thousands of these material disruptions every single month now and it’s something that we haven’t seen before.”

A tight labor market has been a longstanding issue compounded by COVID which precipitated global supply chain problems Nudi said. The subsequent war in Ukraine and resultant material disruptions have created unprecedented challenges he said.

The difficulty isn’t completely around availability General Mills’ principal ingredient – grain. He said 90% of the company’s grain supply is sourced in North America.

“So availability is really not the issue for us” he said. “We have the ingredients that we need. It’s really price and it’s a global grain market. So we’ve been impacted by that... Starch frankly it’s something I didn’t realize what we use in so many different products. It’s really used as a processing aid and starch has been constrained for over a year now and that’s been a real challenge for us. Oil a little bit of knock-on impact of what’s happening in Ukraine has become a challenge from a supply standpoint. Even beyond that again I’m learning all kinds of things I didn’t know but oil has to ship in specific trucks that are built for shipping oil and have drivers that are specifically trained to drive this truck. There’s a shortage of those truckers right now.”

General Mills has disclosed its supply chain difficulties and how they have affected the company’s baked foods Totino’s hot snacks business and refrigerated dough. Conditions have improved Nudi said. The difficulties are also hitting the company’s pet food and treat segments as consumer demand for its Blue Buffalo Nudges True Chews and Top Chews brands continues to grow.

“If you look at our on-shelf availability we’re back to where we need to be” he said. “But then other things pop up. The oil issue that I talked about is a real challenge for us right now.”

The challenges have management’s full attention Nudi said.

“I have a weekly control tower meeting where I meet with our team on the biggest issues that we’re facing and really help try to break down barriers and do things differently than we’ve done before” he said. “So trying to build resiliency back in the supply chain will help us from a sales standpoint as well actually being better in stock levels and at the same time hopefully take out some costs over time as all these disruptions are very costly as well.”

While General Mills has experienced challenges associated with COVID and the tight labor market the difficulties have not been principally at facilities the company operates Nudi said.

“Our frontline workers showed up at work every day and kept cranking out products for our consumers that needed food and our products more than ever before” he said. “And we didn’t lose many of them throughout the pandemic obviously as people had family issues or health issues they would take care of those but they would come back. And part of it is we have a long history with these employees and we treat them well and they treat us well. So that’s been great.

“The bigger knock-on effect has really been at many of our suppliers have had real issues with labor. And I think that drove a lot of these ingredient issues that I talked about as well.”

He added that the company’s distribution centers have experienced labor issues but that those have been improving recently.

The US House Judiciary Committee and other lawmakers and regulators around the world have investigated whether Amazon uses data from sellers to create its own brands and unlawfully favors its own brands on its website.

Amazon has said it doesn’t use the data from individual third-party sellers to inform the development of its own private brands and does not favor its own products on the site.

Most stores start small with their own brands. Grocers for example will often first introduce a shelf-stable product like pasta flour sugar or rice that’s easier to make and where brand loyalty within the category isn’t strong.

“You don’t start with the most difficult things” Steenkamp said. “As stores build more experience and success then they enter new categories.”

How to find out who makes store brands

So how do you tell who’s behind your favorite store brands?

Product recalls are often the most revealing way to find out which brand manufacturers are behind specific private labels.

Last year for example Dole recalled fresh salads and vegetables including private brands for Walmart Kroger and H-E-B.

J.M. Smucker (SJM) recalled certain Jif peanut butter products this year as well as store-branded items it made for Giant Eagle Wawa and Safeway. Large companies such as Conagra and McCain Foods have recalled products from Trader Joe’s.

Then there are the dedicated private label manufacturers such as Treehouse Foods (THS) which makes snacks under the labels of supermarkets big-box chains and other retailers. Nearly one-quarter of the company’s $4.3 billion in sales last year for example came from Walmart (WMT).

Target has dozens of its own brands such as Cat & Jack Universal Thread and up & up. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

James Walser who led the launch of Target’s (TGT) up & up household basics and personal care brand in 2009 said that Target tried to move away from national brand manufacturers during up & up’s development to nimbler suppliers focused solely on making private labels.

Some large retailers also make their own private labels. Kroger for example makes about 30% of its own private products.

Perhaps the strangest store brand manufacturers are retailers that make private brands for their…competitors: Safeway-owned Lucerne Foods manufactures private labels for Safeway’s rivals.

But Gemma Owen and Luca Bish put on a united front on Friday as the 19-year-old dressage champ shared a loved up post from the filming to Instagram.

The Love Island runners up wrapped an arm around one another as fishmonger Luca 23 beamed for a chic snap with Michael Owen's daughter.

Meanwhile Luca went for a pair of black trousers and a complementing shirt adding Christian Louboutin trainers.

While the first shot showed the new couple beam at the camera Luca laughed as he grabbed Gemma's leg in the second while the beauty pouted and fell into his arms.

And further solidifying that the couple are very much 'on' the Brighton native tagged Gemma in an Instagram Story on Friday evening as he attempted to sell her on his home city.

'Am I selling Brighton to you yet @gemowen_1?' quipped Luca as he posted a video of horses.

It marks the first photo shared of the couple together on Gemma's account in a week after fans spotted an apparent snub towards Luca by her family.

The dressage rider's account handlers have avoided sharing any mention or photos of the fishmonger in the run up to the final.

And following Gemma and Luca's second-place finish Luca's family were quick to congratulate the couple posting a snap of them together with a gushing caption.

It read: 'Thank you SO much from the bottom of our hearts for all of the support you’ve shown this gorgeous couple. So excited to continue watching your journey from the outside. You really did win by finding each other.'

This was in stark contrast to Gemma's Instagram which noticeably only posted solo snaps of the brunette beauty in the lead-up and following the final with beau Luca noticeably absent.

No mention: This was in stark contrast to Gemma's Instagram which noticeably only posted solo snaps of the brunette beauty in the lead-up and following the final with beau Luca noticeably absent

Notice something? While each of the Love Island's female finalists' social media accounts featured a tribute to their couple Gemma's was simply a solo snap

'She has shown the nation how mature honest and classy she truly is. From the bottom of our hearts thank you for all the love and support…Gemma is going to be SO overwhelmed.

'We are passing this back to Gemma now… We have loved running her account and being part of her @loveisland journey. We can’t wait for what the future holds.'

Eagle-eyed fans at home were quick to notice this and took to Twitter to suggest that Gemma's family were not overly fond of Luca and that they were doing 'damage control' to protect Gemma's brand.

Despite Gemma finally sharing a snap of Luca it seems there is still trouble in paradise after the couple got into an argument on Thursday night.

Luca admitted to a squabble at the Love Island reunion while they headed home from Elstree Studios both looking sombre as they were snapped in the car.

The photographer said to Luca: 'You've got your hands full there!'

After Ekin-Su and Davide's landslide victory the Essex-based actress has already been tipped to become the show's highest earner in history.

She has already scooped £25000 in prize money and a source has told MailOnline she's already being inundated with lucrative offers meaning she could surpass multi-millionaire Molly-Mae Hague 23 who was runner-up on the 2019 series to become the show's richest ever star.

Ekin-Su who entered the villa on the third day as a bombshell has already had a taste of the spotlight having starred in Turkish soap operas and reality shows before entering the Love Island villa and the brunette is now set to cash in with an estimated £1 million payday.

A source close to Ekin-Su told MailOnline: 'We've never seen the likes of the deals that are already coming through the door. It's not just your typical reality TV fodder.

'She's absolutely inundated with lucrative offers from brands and they're prepared to pay big money to get her onboard. She's going to be the new Molly-Mae Hague!'

The Sligo man shared a snap of Layla resting on his chest as he woke up this morning accompanied by the words “The best possible way to wake up and spend the morning on a gig-day! Layla as @bryanadams once said: Everything I do I do it for you.”

In May 2019 Mark shared the news that he and husband Cailean were going to be having a child together. In October of that year little Layla was born via surrogacy and Mark regularly shares loving pictures of his baby girl. The Westlife star has been a prominent voice in the movement to call for surrogacy legislation in Ireland.

The Westlife boys recently played the Aviva stadium in Dublin and put on an incredible show. Playing to over 50000 fans some who had followed them for the last twenty years and other young fans who are getting to love their music the boys did not disappoint.

Whether you prefer to make homemade peach ice cream with your fresh farmers' market haul get your fill with a seasonal Chick-fil-A milkshake or pick up a pint at the grocery store you can't go wrong when it comes to peach ice cream during a steaming Southern summer. Nostalgic and regional quality peach ice cream is coveted by Southern Living editors.

Although we love to support local creameries when ice cream cravings hit and one editor said peach ice cream ""belongs in my grandmother's kitchen"" we went to the supermarket for this test so that Southern Living readers in all regions of the South could purchase these flavors if they choose. We tested Halo Top Peaches & Cream Breyers Peach Blue Bell Creameries Peaches & Homemade Vanilla Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams Sweet Cream Biscuits & Peach Jam and Publix Premium Peach Ice Cream. Our testers didn't know which brands we were testing and we pre-scooped each ice cream and hid the containers so the taste test was totally blind. Here's what our editors thought of each brand.

Publix Premium Peach Ice Cream

Publix brand's peach ice cream held up a surprisingly complex flavor profile with strong floral notes. A nearby shopper actually recommended we try this one saying it was ""amazing"" and we're glad we took her advice. Publix brand was the only ice cream that had an actual peach ice cream base rather than vanilla or cream so when dotted with chunks of peaches it didn't skimp on peachiness.

Halo Top Peaches & Cream

Testers loved Halo Top's smooth texture that reminded them of gelato or sorbet. At just 320 calories for an entire pint and holding onto a whopping 20 g of protein Halo Top is always our go-to when we want to indulge and not totally blow out a week of healthy eating. That said this flavor didn't slack on sweetness. Testers noticed bright floral notes in this pint that had a pretty peachy color.

Blue Bell Creameries Peaches & Homemade Vanilla

Southern-favorite Blue Bell boasted the most vibrant peachy pink hue that reminded our editors of sherbet. Just like most Blue Bell flavors this one tasted nostalgic and comforting to testers who grew up in the South. Editors loved how creamy and thick scoops of Blue Bell were and each bite was studded with peach jewels.

Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams Sweet Cream Biscuits & Peach Jam

It should come as no shock that Jeni's was highly rated among our taste testers. Jeni's is always coming out with inventive new flavors and our editors loved this twist on classic peach ice cream. Testers noted that there wasn't one bit of Jeni's that tasted artificial and they were right! The peaches for the peach jam portion of the ice cream come from our friends at The Peach Truck so you know the quality is unbeatable. Crumbled biscuits added a homey buttery unexpected surprise to this taste test and editors couldn't get enough.

Breyers Peach

It came as a bit of a surprise that one of the less artisanal ice creams of the bunch was the favorite but Breyers blew the rest of the competition out of the water with the most No. 1 votes. Every tester noted Breyers' creamy consistency and natural peach flavor. Soft and smooth vanilla speckled with real peaches struck a chord with our editors who loved this brand's subtle not overly sweet flavor.

Craig Conover from Southern Charm loves a good treasure hunt and finding that diamond in the rough is especially exciting.

So when his company Sewing Down South partnered with national home furnishing store Home Goods Conover and his team sprung into action. Conover appreciated being able to expand Sewing Down South’s reach beyond online sales and his flagship store on King Street in Charleston South Carolina.

“Shopping at Home Goods is this fun treasure hunt and a lot of people love the store” Conover told Showbiz Cheat Sheet. “I think it’s a great opportunity for more people to own [Sewing Down South] pillows so when they see one at Home Goods that’s what excites me. It gives people a chance to have a piece of Sewing Down South.”

The treasure hunt to find Craig Conover pillows starts at Home Goods

Conover is having a blast seeing photos from customers who have found a Sewing Down South pillow at Home Goods. But he admitted that the Home Goods treasure hunt has been a little more challenging for consumers. During the launch “They sold out really quickly” he said. “So we know the response was really good.”

Like many high-end products sold at Home Goods Sewing Down South pillows will likely always be a treasure hunt. But Conover wants to make sure the hunt is a little easier for customers and hopes to ramp up production so more are readily available.

Craig Conover says Home Goods pillows are the same Sewing Down South signature quality

Beyond the Southern Charm fandom Sewing Down South customers have consistently expressed enthusiasm for the company’s quality and designs. Conover said the pillows sold at Home Goods are the exact same quality just designs that are unique to Home Goods.

“This is an original line to Home Goods” he explained emphasizing that the pillow quality is the same as what is online and in the store. “So the pillows are being designed and made just for Home Goods. You’re not going to find these pillows anywhere else.”

Fans have shared photos of their Sewing Down South “finds” on social media. The adorable bumble bee pattern seems to be a favorite for many customers. Plus customers can find other Sewing Down South designs like a sea turtle and coral pattern at Home Goods.

Sewing Down South merchandise will also be available nationwide. So fans in just about every state could possibly find Conover’s pillows at Home Goods.

Home Goods partnership gives everyone a chance to own a piece of Sewing Down South

Conover hopes the Home Goods partnership turns new consumers into Sewing Down South fans. Also “It gives avid collectors of Sewing Down South a chance to add to their collection with the unique patterns we designed for Home Goods” he said.

He said the partnership is a dream come true. “It’s the same feeling I had when HSN called” he recalled. “That was such a badge of honor. But also the fact that only a couple of years ago I was walking into crafting stores to buy supplies to sew the pillows. Now I can walk into the store and see our pillows. It’s a pretty crazy transformation.”

“I love being tagged in the pillows people find at Home Goods” he added. “And it’s only growing and only getting bigger.”

Beyond Home Goods his retail and online location Conover said fans can also stop by the Sewing Down South booth to pick up merchandise during BravoCon 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3J0c21vdXRoLmNvLnVrL2J1c2luZXNzL2NvbnN1bWVyL2p1ZGVzLWljZS1jcmVhbS10aGUtaGFtcHNoaXJlLWNvbXBhbnktdHJ5aW5nLXRvLWNoYW5nZS10aGUtd29ybGQtb25lLXNwb29uZnVsLWF0LWEtdGltZS0zNzk2MzA30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Hampshire ice cream company trying to make the world a better place one spoonful at a time,"Watch more of our videos on Shots!

If you’ve ever picked up an ice cream from Watkins and Faux on the seafront at Southsea or treated yourself to an indulgent cold pudding at Chambers in Southsea or Artys in Clarence Marina in Gosport - or indeed at attractions around the county such as Manor Farm in Bursledon or many National Trust properties then chances are you’ve had the taste of Jude’s.

Or possibly more likely you may have seen it in the freezers of many supermarkets in the area perhaps in Sainsbury’s Waitrose Tesco or the Southern Co-op.

Its low-key but stylish striped tubs are beginning to be recognisable as it grows and grows.

Chow Theo and Alex Mezger. Jude's ice cream is based in Twyford Hampshire

However few people realise it’s a Hampshire company and one that is aiming to make the world a better place one step at a time – and not just by creating new flavours. While it prides itself in the taste of peach and champagne and its mint choc chip and Jude’s very much has its sights set on the health of the planet.

The Jude’s story starts 20 years ago when Theo Mezger after years working in the City decided to start his own company.

Being surrounded by cows he settled on ice cream and after mastering the basics created a miniature factory in a barn in his home at Easton near Winchester.

Inside the Jude's factory near Twyford

Starting with supplying the village pub things soon grew. His sons Chow and Alex and their best friend James joined the fledgling enterprise and in time it moved to its current home – a beautifully bucolic industrial estate just outside Twyford.

And it was at that point that things started to take off. The recognisable stripy tubs came in around this time and the retail - rather than supply - section of the business exploded leading to an expansion that now sees between 50 and 60 staff on the books. This - and the large factory space - is a far cry from the early days but one factor that has remained the same is the business’s social conscience though that has evolved too.

Just as it was the first business in the country to make salted caramel ice cream it has continued to try to innovate in other areas.

‘Since the beginning our approach has been that business is not something that is separate from the community or separate from family life’ says Chow. ‘It doesn’t stand alone.

The Jude's team

‘Literally it was like that in the beginning. Our team was from the village and we were based in the village where we grew up.

‘Jude’s is fully integrated in the lives of all our team. It impacts the families of our team and the community in Twyford and the community where our team live. It impacts our supply chain it impacts the environment and our customers.

‘The point is that business is not something separate from life or community or people. That’s been our approach. That’s why “business is a force for good” is a no-brainer. We are absolutely determined that Jude’s purpose is “to bring life”.’

Fine words perhaps - but words that have some evidence and proof behind them.

Inside the factory

Apart from ice cream the focus at Jude’s is firmly on the environment with de-carbonising the central plank.

‘In the life of Jude’s the most important thing we can do is reduce our carbon footprint’ said Chow. ‘There are not enough offsets in the world to carry on emitting carbon.’

And to help with this Jude’s employed the services of carbon expert Mike Berners-Lee (the brother of Tim Berners-Lee who is credited with inventing the world wide web).

Prof Berners-Lee and his Small World Consulting team gave Jude’s targets to reduce the amount of carbon it used. Marginal gains became the mantra - where could efficiencies be made in packaging in transport in energy supply and in ingredients.

Jude’s has committed to a 43 per cent reduction in carbon intensity by 2030 and reduced the carbon footprint of its ice cream by 20 per cent in 2022 alone. Hand in hand with this is a decision to offset 110 per cent of emissions.

Chow says that the aim isn’t just to feel worthy but to exert pressure on the rest of the food industry.

Jude's lower calorie salted caramel and double chocolate

‘Everything we do is seen through the prism of the best possible ice cream and carbon intensity’ he said.

‘Also we are asking all our suppliers for ingredients with a carbon footprint of everything. ‘Lots of people have not done that work yet but if we are asking that question then everyone will do that work.

‘Our sales pitch is demonstrating to customers how we are reducing their carbon footprint through the supply chain.’

The company has been named a B Corp a scheme run by B Lab which describes itself as a ‘nonprofit network transforming the global economy to benefit all people communities and the planet’. In short businesses have to be audited to show they are behaving responsibly in five areas - governance workers customers community and environment.

And environmentally one area which has exploded is plant-based ice cream moving away from dairy.

Pointing to the emissions ramifications of animal products Chow said: ‘Seventy per cent of the world’s agricultural land is set aside for animals grazing or growing feed. We should be running out of reasons to not eat plant-based.

‘With our approach - we are always about quality indulgence first. Our plant-based products are so good. They taste excellent - that’s the number one goal. But it’s clear that plant-based is better for the environment.’

The general swing in society away from meat and dairy-based food is replicated at Jude’s - seven years ago Chow said one per cent of their products were plant-based and by 2024 it’s forecast to be half.",,,

Saturday marks the third day of major flight cancellations after thunderstorms pounded major airports on the East Coast on Thursday making for one of the worst days for flight cancellations of the past six weeks.

This summer travel season has been plagued with flight cancellations and delays as airlines contend with staffing shortages severe weather and air traffic control delays.

As of Saturday evening at least 636 flights into within or out of the United States were canceled and an additional 5921 domestic flights were delayed according to FlightAware.

Newark Liberty International and Chicago Midway International Airport topped the list of US airports with the highest number of canceled flights the flight tracking website reported.

American Airlines canceled 4% and delayed 24% of its Saturday flights according to the site.

Meanwhile United had 4% of its flights canceled and 23% delayed and Delta had 2% canceled and 22% of flights delayed FlightAware reported.

About 41% of JetBlue’s flights and 36% of Southwest’s flights were also delayed on Saturday according to the website.

“We continue working through a variety of weather related challenges across the country this weekend” Southwest Airlines told CNN in a statement on Saturday. “Our teams are working to get our customers to their destinations safely and as quickly as possible.”

CNN has reached out to the other domestic carriers for comment about Saturday’s delays and cancellations.

Amid the flurry of flight cancellations and a flood of complaints from passengers the US Department of Transportation on Wednesday proposed expanding the circumstances when airline passengers can get refunds.

The department said it was inundated with complaints from airlines passengers seeking refunds since the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The proposed refund rules come after a private June meeting that Pete Buttigieg held with airline CEOs in which he told them to fix the summer flight schedules that have been bedeviled with thousands of cancellations.

The incident which landed the flight attendant in the hospital occurred on July 1 when the pilots of Southwest flight WN2029 made a so-called ‘visual approach’ landing at Santa Ana’s John Wayne Orange County Airport (SNA).

Due to the short runway at SNA airport the pilots were aiming for the ‘touchdown zone’ with minimal ‘floating’ but it ended up being a firm landing. Shortly after landing the pilots received a call from the cabin informing them one of the flight attendants had been injured.

Paramedics were called and the flight attendant had to be transported to the hospital where she was later diagnosed with a spinal injury.

The flight attendants told NTSB investigators that she had secured the galley as normal and had taken her jumpseat at the back of the plane where she adopted the standard ‘brace position’ for landing.

But upon landing the plane hit the ground so forcefully that she thought the plane had crashed. The flight attendant says she immediately felt pain in her back and neck and she couldn’t move.

Despite the serious nature of the incident the NTSB has not made any recommendations and the investigation into the accident has now been closed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjN255LmNvbS9sYWd1YXJkaWEtYWlycG9ydC1qZXRibHVlLXNvdXRod2VzdC1haXJsaW5lcy1wbGFuZXMtY2xpcC8xMjEwNzUyMS_SAVlodHRwczovL2FiYzdueS5jb20vYW1wL2xhZ3VhcmRpYS1haXJwb3J0LWpldGJsdWUtc291dGh3ZXN0LWFpcmxpbmVzLXBsYW5lcy1jbGlwLzEyMTA3NTIxLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,JetBlue plane clips wingtip of Southwest jet at LaGuardia airport in New York City FAA says,"JetBlue plane clips wingtip of Southwest jet at LaGuardia airport: FAA

It’s enough to give anyone already on edge about how to handle possible flight delays and cancellations yet another reason to pop an antacid or two: the prospect of delayed lost or damaged baggage.

The concern is valid especially during rough winter weather and situations such as the grounding of Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft. Handing over checked suitcases can almost feel like a leap of faith these days.

Yet you’re not totally powerless. There are things you can do and strategies you can take to help avoid losing a bag or at least minimize the impact of delayed lost stolen and damaged luggage.

Before you go to the airport

Book nonstop flights: If you’re really concerned about your checked luggage prioritize nonstop flights or at least layovers with a generous amount of time said Scott Keyes the founder of flight deals and travel advice site Going.com (formerly Scott’s Cheap Flights).

“Bags are most likely to get lost in that transfer between planes at connection especially if there’s a tight connection.” And he said that’s doubly so for international flights with tight connections.

Consider discount airlines: He said full-service airlines are more likely to lose your bags than the discount airlines which tend to have more nonstop flights that have a lower likelihood of losing a bag in transit.

Keyes said he wouldn’t make a booking decision based solely on this but it’s “an interesting side factor to consider.”

Take pictures of your luggage and its contents: Jo Hoban a travel agent in Spanish Fork Utah about 50 miles south of Salt Lake City told CNN Travel that she advises her clients to “take a picture of their bags because the first things airline offices will ask you is what is the brand name of the bag what is the color of the bag the size of the bag and the contents of the bag.”

She also said people should lay out what they are planning to pack on the bed and take a picture of that too. If the bag is lost that helps create a content record.

Use baggage tracking: “Many airlines allow you to see the status of your bags in their apps which can help give you peace of mind that your bag is on the flight with you — or at least give you insight into your bag’s location should it get delayed” Scott’s Cheap Flights said in an email news release.

You can set up independent tracking yourself. Paula Twidale senior vice president of travel for AAA cited AirTag which connects with an Apple device so you can track the tag’s location.

Properly ID your suitcases on the inside too: The consumer advocate group Travelers United says put your info on the inside too in case your outside tag gets torn off. Hoban makes the same suggestion.

“I have had a bag taken off the carousel at the airport in Salt Lake [City]. Luckily I knew the people who took my bag so it was easy to exchange it” she said. “But again what if I did not know those people? What if they were total strangers and got my bag home? Hopefully they’re good honest people and see that I have a name and phone number in the bag that they can call me and let me know the mistake.”

The power of carry-ons: The airlines can’t lose baggage you never check in. Twidale suggests packing as light as you can and use just carry-ons. You’ll save time leaving the airport and have more peace of mind.

Review your credit card coverage: Before you buy extra travel insurance Keyes suggested you check your credit card policy for travel protection.

You might get supplemental compensation (for what the airlines don’t cover) not only for lost bags but also for reimbursements for things you may need to buy while you’re waiting for your bag.

At the airport before you fly

Check your bags in a timely manner: Travelers United says last-minute baggage check-ins can lead to a greater chance of trouble.

“Don’t push the system. The smallest delay can have serious consequences when your luggage is cruising down the conveyor belt and selected for security examination with little time to spare” its website says.

Work that phone camera again: Keyes suggested that just before handing over your checked suitcases open them up and take a picture.

“If your bag does get lost and you’ve got any valuables in there … having a photograph of what was in there is really going to bolster your case to get compensation after the fact.”

Check your baggage tag’s destination: Travelers United also advises you double-check your airline luggage tags and make sure they’re going to where you are going especially if you’re doing curbside check-in. And the North Carolina Consumers Council reminds people to keep their baggage claim ticket or sticker.

If your baggage is delayed

Scope out other spots at the airport: If your suitcases aren’t on the designated pick-up carousel The Points Guy travel advice website suggests checking nearby carousels and if you don’t see them there try the airline’s baggage office. This is also a good time to put those aforementioned tracking apps to work.

Report your issue and fill out forms at the airport: If your bags haven’t shown up let the airline know.

“Many times airline personnel will explain that the luggage has been located but will be delayed until the next flight” Travelers United says. “If you have the time wait. If not fill out the appropriate lost luggage forms at the airport.”

Let the airline deliver your bags: Keyes said if an airline can locate your suitcases but it’s going to be hours before they arrive make sure the reps have the address where you’ll be and use the airline’s delivery service.

Keep receipts: “If you buy anything to get you through the days without your luggage — from a new swimsuit to toothpaste — keep the receipts. You may need these to get reimbursed” Scott’s Cheap Flights (now Going.com) advises.

If your luggage is lost

Check your airline’s claims and compensation policy: Each airline should have website information on what to do if your bag is lost. For example this is Delta Air Lines’ page. This is American Airlines’ page. And this is Southwest Airlines’ page. And airlines based outside the United States have their own systems. This is what to do if flying British Airways.

If the airline isn’t being helpful: “If the airline is dragging its feet on compensation … don’t be afraid to complain to the Department of Transportation Keyes said regarding US airlines. You can file a complaint here.

“They’ve got a special aviation enforcement office where they’re being much more proactive about protecting consumers and trying to clamp down on airlines when they’re not providing customers with the type of compensation or reimbursement that they’re required to do under federal laws.”

For information of making claims for UK flights click here. And check the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority’s site here. Get more information on Canadian flights here.

Liability limits: There’s fine print exceptions and paperwork / documentation hurdles but you can eventually get cash for your lost bags.

For US domestic flights the maximum liability amount allowed by DOT regulation is $3800. Airlines are free to pay more than the limit but are not required to do so. For international flights that figure is $1780. Find out more from the DOT here.

Damaged bags: If you see your luggage is damaged while still at the airport report it there. Airlines aren’t required to pay for damages to items caused by improper packing according to the DOT nor are they responsible for “certain categories of items (for example: fragile items electronics cash perishable items …)”

They are liable for damage to wheels handles and straps."

Starbucks stores were either temporarily closed or offered delivery or MOP payments only Starbucks said recently. Yin Liqin/China News Service via Getty Images.

Over two-thirds of of Starbucks sales are now made through drive-thrus mobile orders or delivery.

Starbucks initially built its brand around being a ""third place"" with premium coffee.

An analyst says the change shows Starbucks' successful ability to adapt to changing trends.

Starbucks is moving farther away from its roots in favor of convenience and efficiency.

Over two-thirds of orders now come from the mobile app drive-thru and delivery the coffee giant said in an August earnings call. In other words just 28% of customers enter Starbucks and place their orders with baristas some of them staying and drinking their beverages on Starbucks property.

Customers seem to love the convenience of alternative ordering methods and Starbucks is making it even easier. About 90% of new locations are being built with drive-thrus The Wall Street Journal reported in May. About half of locations have technology that allows customers to order through tablets operated by workers in drive-thru lines and 65% of locations are planned to have them by the end of 2022 CEO Howard Schultz said in the call.

Starbucks closed some lower-performing mall locations in the past to focus more on drive-thrus. The chain is considering locations that are drive-thru only and has already created pick-up only stores and partnered with Amazon to launch a joint Amazon Go store where only mobile orders and payments are accepted.

Starbucks initially grew into a massive success by popularizing a premium coffee experience and introducing Americans to espressos drinks like lattes. The chain presented itself as a ""third place"" where people can gather outside of homes and workplaces. This concept is in conflict with the chain's more recent emphasis on convenience shifting the definition of ""third place"" into a ""mindset"" over a physical space.

These changes at Starbucks don't mean that most locations will be without seating and space for customers to gather Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough told Insider. Focusing on drive-thru and mobile ordering is in part an impact of the pandemic but the shift in priority was happening before COVID-19 hit Yarbrough said.

""The days of customers getting a coffee and hanging out are probably behind"" he told Insider. ""They probably don't need all this room for people to sit around."" Drive-thrus have outperformed locations without drive-thrus he said and having smaller seating areas to maintain could give Starbucks some savings.

Pivoting to prioritize these other methods of reaching customers is key to what has made Starbucks so successful because the chain is able to adapt to changing customer preferences Yarbrough said He pointed out that 75% of drinks sold by Starbucks are cold which weren't even part of the chain's original menu.

Other quick-service chains have similarly pivoted to prioritize drive-thrus too. Chipotle has focused on adding Chipotlanes to new locations and building drive-thru-only restaurants which use mobile ordering. The advantages are similar to what Starbucks is likely considering — drive-thrus tend to have higher margins and operate faster.

Gender-affirming care as defined by the World Health Organisation encompasses a range of social psychological behavioural and medical interventions “designed to support and affirm an individual’s gender identity” when it conflicts with the gender they were assigned at birth. Harvard research shows that gender-affirming care can significantly reduce suicidal ideation.

The American coffee giant’s health insurance has covered gender reassignment surgery since 2012 and several gender-affirming procedures like hair transplant and breast reduction since 2018 according to CNBC.

However after more than 100 of its 9000 US cafes voted to unionise under Workers United in the last seven months Starbucks told its unionised transgender employees in several states that they could lose gender-affirming healthcare coverage according to a Workers United complaint filed with the National Labour Relations Board (NLRB) Bloomberg reported in June.

Workers United accused Starbucks of “threatening employees with loss of benefits” and “loss of gender-affirming healthcare for transgender employees” according to Neha Cremin an Oklahoma store barista. The union alleged that the company is trying to force employees from not exercising their unionising rights.

Starbucks has been trying to blunt unionising under interim CEO Howard Schultz by emphasising the potential drawbacks of collective bargaining such as federal labour laws that prohibit the company from unilaterally hiking wages across unionised cafes without contract negotiations.

“I think the company realises that we as trans partners feel particularly vulnerable at this time. I think that in some cases they are willing to take advantage of that” Cremin told Bloomberg

Cremin’s manager recently gave a “veiled threat” in a one-on-one meeting. “Just know that if you unionise when you are negotiating your benefits you could gain you could lose or you could stay the same. I know specifically you have used the trans healthcare benefits” he allegedly told her. However Starbucks spokesperson Reggie Borges told CNBC that Cremin’s claim was false.

Maddie Doran a transgender employee with the Starbucks store on 75th Street and Interstate 35 who was fired for 10 months lost the insurance cover after joining a union campaign In These Times reported.

Without the benefit a gender-affirming surgery would have cost Doran $42000. The benefit ​“was waved over my head” after Doran joined the campaign with one store manager privately telling her ​“You’re here for the gender-affirming surgeries and I’m worried about you [losing that benefit and] becoming the minority [in contract negotiations] because ultimately the union decides.”

Subsequently Doran who was accused of stealing money and two other outspoken union supporters Michael Vestigo and Alydia Claypool were sacked in the same week in April. Denying the charge Doran said that they were fired in retaliation by Starbucks.

As Doran couldn’t afford the surgery one of her friends created a GoFundMe campaign to raise the $42000. She has raised $2200 so far.

Gender-affirming healthcare according to Doran can be used as a weapons against unionisation efforts. Retaliatory store closures or sackings can especially hurt trans employees who rely on hard-to-find benefits.

Describing the union-busting tactics of Starbucks Doran said when she and her co-workers declared a strike in March to protest “unfair working conditions” managers “tried to throw them off the grounds of a local hotel where they’d been called for a mandatory anti-union meeting.

When a group of workers gathered outside after the meeting Doran alleged a Starbucks manager told them ​“You all need to go” and then complained to the hotel front desk which said that the police had been called.

Subsequently Doran Vestigo and Claypool who all had made pro-union statements in the media were terminated in April. The NLRB filed a complaint against Starbucks in May alleging that the firings were retaliatory. Claypool has since been reinstated.

In an email response sent to In These Times Starbucks claimed that the company would ​“bargain in good faith” but could make no ​“guarantees about any benefits”. “Even if we were to offer a certain benefit at the bargaining table a union could decide to exchange it for something else.”

Katie Barrows president Nonprofit Professional Employees Union differs. ​“Employees form unions to improve their workplaces. Additionally when employees organise they are the union which means they negotiate and vote to approve their union contract—union members are not going to vote for a contract that leaves them worse off. … I’ve only seen union contracts drastically improve workers’ pay benefits and working conditions” she explained.

The Workers United complaint was filed on behalf of employees at Doran’s and Cremin’s stores. Some workers at Starbucks stores have reported discrimination against transgender employees. In 2018 Maddie Wade a transgender employee sued Starbucks for discrimination alleging her manager repeatedly misgendered her.

In a 2020 survey conducted by hospitality union Unite Here of workers at airport Starbucks stores which are run by a subcontractor at least four employees reported discrimination such as ​“offensive and transphobic comments from managers”.

“Starbucks will posture that they care about queer people and they will posture that they care about any minority group but the second you try to have a democratic workplace or speak up for yourself or don’t let them bully you—suddenly you’re public enemy number one and they completely shut you out” Doran added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJha2VtYWcuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzE2MTkzLXN0YXJidWNrcy1sb29raW5nLWZvci1wZXJtYW5lbnQtY2Vv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks looking for permanent CEO,"Howard Schultz who returned to Starbucks Corp. as interim chief executive officer on April 4 will remain in that role through the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as the company continues its search for its next permanent CEO Starbucks said on June 6. The company said it is on track to name a new CEO in the coming months.

Starbucks said the timeline provides the company “the ideal runway for a seamless transition and continuity of leadership through the 2022 holiday season as the business transformation continues.”

“Since returning as interim CEO on April 4 Schultz has engaged deeply with partners (employees) of all levels of the company working directly with the leadership team to shape a strategic plan for the future of a reimagined Starbucks Coffee Co.” the company said. “The reinvention plan is being designed through co-creation across the organization with a focus on exceeding the expectations of both partners and customers.”

TONAWANDA N.Y. — Starbucks workers in Tonawanda walked out in protest for a second straight day after a shift supervisor was fired.

A video of the walkout had more than 1.5 million views on social media as of Saturday night.

Sam Amato worked with the company for 13 years. Starbucks Workers United said Amato was fired for helping to organize and lead the store's union.

The coffee giant says Amato was fired for closing the store lobby without permission from management.

The union claims Amato's terminal papers reference several so-called ""coaching sessions"" which they say never even happened.

Starbucks Workers United has filed an unfair labor practice charge against the company saying this is the ninth union leader in Western New York to be fired.

Last month the Starbucks employees at the Transit Commons location voted 11-1 in the union election becoming the eighth store in Western New York to do so.

The union says workers at the Buffalo store have been trying to hold the election since last September but were delayed by union-busting tactics and other administrative hurdles.

“After many long months of union busting shake-ups unfair policy enforcement and turnover the likes of which we’ve never seen it’s amazing to join so many other stores around the country in the fight to be treated fairly by the company we love"" says Michael Sanabria a worker at the Transits Common store.

The 15-second clip starts off with the barista Kay (@kayli.cernan) looking disgusted. The camera shifts over to the menu where one of the new drinks reads “cold brew with lemonade.” As she makes the drink she looks repulsed throughout the video. When she takes her first sip after making the concoction she recoils gagging into her hand.

The caption reads “new featured drink…… immediately no.”

The video has racked up 1.3 million views since it was posted on July 30. There was a divide in the comments with some agreeing that it didn’t appear to be appetizing.

“It was traumatizing to try” one user wrote.

“I thought at first you were talking about salted caramel sweet cream and I was like??? That’s sounds good. Cold brew and lemonade is a no from me” a second agreed.

“No but when you sip the first taste is kinda good and then the long lasting aftertaste is HELL” a third stated.

Kay even reinforced how terrible it tasted in the comments “like i just threw up in my mouth. the taste stayed in my mouth for So Long.”

“At my job we have this already but we add mashed berries to it and I’ve been told it tastes like tea I hate it though” one user noted.

“A spritz of lemon in iced coffee is a game changer but half lemonade in a cold brew is a felony” another argued.

Other users disagreed claiming that they think the beverage tastes good especially when additional ingredients are involved.

“It’s good with raspberry syrup” one user suggested.

“I love cold brew lemonade we make this at the coffee shop I work at” a second added.

“Okay but hear me out it’s really good with raw sugar or sweetener don’t knock it until you try it” a third stated.

“Cold brew with lemonade is my favorite. I go to Panera specifically for it. Also – sparkling water lemon and espresso” a fourth concurred.

The Daily Dot reached out to Kay for comment via TikTok comment as other methods of contact where unavailable.

Norm was born 83 years ago on Dec 7 1938 in Somerset Kentucky to Bernard Urban and Juliet (Gudorp) Luttbeg and grew up in St Louis Missouri. Professor Emeritus of Political Science at Texas A&M University Norm was deeply respected in his field author of many books and textbooks and endlessly in search of better data to understand voter behavior and the decision-making of state and local lawmakers. He also took his responsibility as a teacher seriously and taught thousands of college students about state and local governments examined with an eye always on what the empirical data could tell us.

Norm was also an adventurer. With his best travel partner his wife Alice Norm ventured to all seven continents in his lifetime. He was always dreaming and planning for the next trip slightly off the beaten path and away from the crowds. He led students to study abroad in England Italy and Australia and travelled for the State Department to South Korea and Azerbaijan. His children remember long summer trips in a van “knocking around” the western United States hiking camping and eating gorp. They also remember sandy sunburned car trips home from the Gulf Coast beaches of Florida where Norm raced Hobie Cats in the 1970s.

Norm had a better than average palate for food beer a good red wine vanilla ice cream and excellent sound quality. After moving inland to Texas Norm became a high-end stereophile listening to countless hours of jazz and other good music while fiddling with his stereo system to get as close as possible to true sound fidelity. His family never really got it but his fellow stereophiles did.

Loving husband for almost 62 years to Alice spotted first across the dance floor when they were both 18 (he cut in on an older fraternity brother). Rock solid dad to Carrie (Emmett) and Barney (Mary). Fun Papa to grandchildren Rory Kate and Laura Coleman and Ella (Jay) Ogle and Henry Luttbeg. Big brother to Michael (Bonnie) and David (Lizbeth) Luttbeg. Lifelong friend to many including those gone before him. A dog person through and through - nothing made him laugh like the antics of a goofy dog. Good job dad we think you got every last drop of adventure out of this life.

Service to be held at a later date. The family prefers that any memorials please be sent in his memory to Hospice Brazos Valley (https://www.hospicebrazosvalley.org/) .

This service eliminates the need to pack up the kids and physically go the library to checkout or return items of their choice. It’s also a terrific option for caregivers and shut-ins who may not be able to count on being able to get out of the house on a regular basis.

New school year

Schools reopen on Aug. 10 so please be alert for students cars and school busses that are back on the roadways again. Plan a few extra minutes for your drive so you can afford to slow down and use a bit more caution out on the roads.

Team Up group

The Team Up group will meet at 8:30 a.m. Aug. 16 at the Hastings Branch Library in the main meeting room. Residents business owners and social service providers are all invited to attend to learn what’s going on around the area and discuss ways to participate. There are several fall and winter events on deck for Hastings; some good advertising opportunities available at these events! Volunteers are also always needed.

Wreaths Across America

The Veteran’s Council of St. Johns County will once again participate in the Wreaths Across America program for 2022 and the work starts now! The council is dedicated to ensuring that every headstone in the St. Augustine National Cemetery is adorned with a live holiday wreath.

Gallery:Wreaths Across America

The community is invited to send donations to help purchase the wreaths. Individual wreaths are $15 and if two wreaths are purchased at $30 the council will receive a third wreath free of charge. Business and individual support is needed to tend to the more than 1200 gravesites at the cemetery.

Another way the community can pay their respects is to attend the Dec. 17 ceremony at the cemetery after the placement of the wreaths. Youth organizations are encouraged to participate to learn about and honor our veterans.

Checks can be made payable to Wreaths Across America and sent to the Veterans Council of St. Johns County P.O. Box 2117 St. Augustine FL 32085-2117. For information contact the campaign chair SGM (Ret.) Ray Quinn at 904-797-5622.

Kevin Lobo arrived in Ireland last week to cut the ribbon on the 156000 square foot building which Stryker the company he leads had just opened at its Anngrove 3D printing facility in Carrigtwohill in Cork.

Lobo the company’s chairman and chief executive didn’t make the journey across the Atlantic alone but was accompanied by the entire Stryker board.

“We have other facilities nearby that make a lot of other products and that’s one of the reasons I brought the board here: they’re going to see the 3D printing centre of excellence and the instruments division’s innovation centre but also some of the manufacturing facilities” Lobo told the Business Post.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vc29maWFnbG9iZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8wNi9pdGFsaWFucy10by1hcnJpdmUtYnktbWlkLWF1Z3VzdC10by1qb2luLWJ1bGdhcmlhLWJhc2VkLW5hdG8tYmF0dGxlLWdyb3VwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Italians to arrive by mid-August to join Bulgaria-based Nato battle group,"Up to 750 Italian military personnel with 50 items of military equipment are expected to relocate to Bulgaria by mid-August Bulgaria’s Defence Ministry said.

The Italians are to be part of the Bulgaria-based Nato battle group which has Italy as its framework nation.

The Defence Ministry said that six motor convoys with personnel military equipment and material resources will travel on Bulgaria’s national roads from Greece to the Novo Selo training ground escorted by Military Police.

The formation of the battle group in Bulgaria was given the go-ahead by the previous government in decisions in March and May 2022.

The battle group will also include a company of up to 140 military personnel from Bulgaria’s army up to 15 officers in the group’s headquarters as well as up to 40 military personnel from Albania.

Formations from other Nato countries are expected to join the battle group the Defence Ministry said.



“The multinational formation will complement the national capabilities to guarantee the security and territorial integrity of our country” the ministry said.

“The building of a combat-capable battle group on Bulgarian territory is an expression of the determination of our country and the allies to share the responsibility for ensuring the security of the member countries contributing to strengthening the deterrent defence potential of Nato’s Eastern flank” it said.

In a separate statement the Defence Ministry said that on August 6 Defence Chief Admiral Emil Eftimov held talks with the commanding general of United States Army Europe and Africa General Darryl Williams who was on a one-day working visit to Bulgaria.

The statement said that they discussed developments in ground forces regarding deterrence and defence of Nato’s Eastern Flank.

Eftimov and Williams reviewed the transformation of the battle group deployed on Bulgarian territory in accordance with the decisions taken at the Nato Summit in Madrid.

The pace of the exercises and training as well as the possibilities for increasing the level of interoperability in a multinational format were discussed.

Eftimov noted the good interaction of the US Cavalry Stryker company with the divisions of the Bulgarian land forces during the joint training the statement said.

The long complicated history of its release,"Although 2022 will likely be heralded as the year 5G truly went mainstream we’ve traveled a long and winding road to get here. Carriers began actively working on preparing this leading-edge cellular tech as early as 2015 but it wasn’t until the end of 2018 that the first 5G mobile towers came online. It also took until 2020 before 5G was much more than a curiosity for early adopters.

Although previous cellular technologies like 4G/LTE also spent a long time in the research and development stages those didn’t experience nearly the same growing pains that 5G has. When 4G/LTE services began rolling out broadly in 2011 it was the same basic technology across all the major U.S. carriers.

Things have been considerably more complicated with 5G. Since the newer technology promises the kind of performance previously exclusive to wired broadband services it comes with more demanding requirements and runs over a much wider range of frequencies.

This has made deploying 5G somewhat more challenging as carriers try to find more radio spectrum to carry the best 5G signals. They also need to keep their 4G/LTE networks running at peak performance while sharing the airwaves with new 5G services.

The humble beginnings of 5G

Many folks don’t know that the first 5G deployments in the United States weren’t for mobile devices at all. In 2017 the carriers began trialing fixed wireless 5G services as a replacement for wired broadband home internet. Closed trials of 5G home internet ran well into 2018 before becoming commercially available later that same year.

It wasn’t until early 2019 that the first 5G mobile networks rolled out. Verizon led the way in April with a relatively small 5G footprint in core areas of Chicago and Minneapolis arguably beating out three South Korean carriers to become the first commercial 5G smartphone service on the planet.

Verizon expanded its service to several other cities throughout 2019 including Denver Providence St. Paul Atlanta Detroit Indianapolis Washington D.C. Phoenix Panama City New York City Dallas Omaha Houston and Boston.

The carrier had all these cities under its belt before rivals T-Mobile and AT&T turned the switch on their own 5G networks but there was a big catch. As a result of Verizon’s use of the extremely high frequency (EHF) — and extremely short range — millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum 5G service in each of these cities was confined to very small and specific areas. Stray more than a block away from a 5G zone and you would quickly find yourself back on the carrier’s standard 4G/LTE service.

The upside is that if you were near one of these rare mmWave 5G towers you could experience phenomenal speeds. It wasn’t uncommon to see speeds in the 500 to 1000Mbps (1Gbps) range.

Sprint had also begun dipping its toes into 5G in early 2019 using the mid-band 2.5GHz spectrum that was already carrying its 4G/LTE traffic. Those deployments were relatively short-lived though as a year later it would find itself folded into the new T-Mobile which had other plans for that spectrum.

Expanding 5G across the nation

While Verizon focused on delivering the fastest possible 5G speeds to tiny areas AT&T and T-Mobile were working instead on building more expansive 5G networks using low-band frequencies that could travel much greater distances.

Both carriers turned on their larger 5G networks in December 2019 with T-Mobile claiming its network covered 200 million people out of the gate while AT&T only promised coverage for “tens of millions” of its customers. This isn’t to be confused with AT&T’s 5G Evolution (5GE) network which launched in 2018 but was really just a misleading name for its advanced 4G/LTE services.

The two carriers used different pieces of the low-band spectrum with AT&T using higher frequency signals that were paired with its 4G/LTE network in key cities — only about 15 during its initial launch — while T-Mobile piggybacked on its 600MHz spectrum that was already covering vast swaths of the countryside. By mid-2020 T-Mobile was able to leverage that spectrum to boast 5G coverage in all 50 states including Alaska.

Verizon didn’t join the nationwide 5G party until late 2020 when it rebranded its mmWave 5G service as its 5G Ultra Wideband (5G UW) network. It did this to make room for a new 5G Nationwide offering that it said would deliver 5G to 200 million more people throughout 1800 towns and cities across the nation.

The first 5G smartphones

The earliest 5G deployments were exciting but a bit premature — especially Verizon’s. When the first mmWave cells went live in Chicago there were barely any handsets that supported 5G at all — much less the mmWave flavor of 5G that Verizon used.

In fact the only compatible handset on the market at the time of that initial 5G launch was Motorola’s midrange Moto Z3 which was sold exclusively on the Verizon network. It also required a separate Moto Mod add-on module to provide 5G compatibility.

The Moto Z3/Moto Mod solution was a strange arrangement but fortunately 5G enthusiasts didn’t have to wait long for more options. Samsung’s Galaxy S10 5G and LG’s V50 ThinQ came along in May followed by the Huawei Mate X OnePlus Pro 7 5G Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 5G and ZTE Axon 10 Pro 5G.

Those early 5G smartphones also had another critical catch. In 2019 Verizon and Sprint were offering 5G services but doing so on different frequencies. Early 5G smartphones like LG’s V50 ThinQ and the OnePlus Pro 7 5G couldn’t pack in all the necessary frequencies for both carriers so they were sold in two different versions on each carrier. This meant many early Verizon 5G phones wouldn’t work on Sprint and vice-versa.

Meanwhile Apple released its iPhone 11 lineup in 2019 with no 5G support at all. The message from Cupertino was clear: 5G wasn’t a big enough deal yet to warrant its inclusion in Apple’s flagship smartphone lineup.

That’s a fair assessment since Apple builds its products for the masses and 5G was available to less than 5% of U.S. consumers in September 2019. That had changed significantly by the time the iPhone 12 was released a year later and 5G has been standard on every iPhone since with support for every 5G band from T-Mobile’s 600MHz low-band to AT&T’s 39GHz mmWave in every U.S. model save the lower-cost iPhone SE.

T-Mobile takes the lead

By November 2019 Verizon had 5G coverage in small areas of 16 U.S. cities and Sprint claimed around 16 million people under its 5G umbrella.

So it’s easy to appreciate how big of a deal it was when T-Mobile flipped the switch on its nationwide 5G network on December 2 promising 5G service to 200 million people in more than 5000 cities and towns across the U.S. In one fell swoop the carrier had just increased 5G availability tenfold.

While Verizon still offered significantly faster speeds that didn’t matter to 99% of its customers since they were stuck on the carrier’s 4G network. In those early days T-Mobile’s initial 5G network wasn’t much faster than its 4G/LTE network but it also wasted no time making dramatic improvements.

First off T-Mobile worked to build a “standalone” 5G network — one that wouldn’t rely on sharing the airwaves with older 4G/LTE traffic. This allowed it to make the most of its low-band 600MHz 5G spectrum by dedicating towers to carrying only 5G traffic.

In April 2020 T-Mobile also completed its merger with Sprint and quickly began decommissioning the other carrier’s 2.5GHz towers to make room for what would become its 5G Ultra Capacity (5G UC) network. This mid-band 5G spectrum sits in the sweet spot offering the best combination of range and speed and by the end of 2021 T-Mobile had extended this coverage to over 200 million people across the country.

Carving up the airwaves

While T-Mobile was busy at work building out its midrange 2.5GHz network its rivals were left at a disadvantage. Neither AT&T nor Verizon had any mid-band spectrum available to them at that time so they were forced to stay on the low-end.

AT&T continued slowly rolling out its low-band 5G network while deploying a faster 5G Plus (5G+) mmWave network in dense urban areas. While Verizon had started from the opposite end with its 2019 mmWave deployments in late 2020 it switched on its low-band 5G Nationwide network to bring 5G to the majority of its customers.

Unfortunately since these extended 5G networks relied on the same frequencies used by the carriers’ 4G/LTE services customers got little more than the privilege of seeing a 5G symbol appear on their smartphones. Actual download speeds were rarely any better than 4G/LTE and in some cases were slower as 4G/LTE traffic always had priority on those airwaves.

C-band changes the game

T-Mobile’s 2.5GHz spectrum gave it a massive head start on deploying a faster 5G network but the other carriers weren’t about to be left behind. In early 2021 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) put a chunk of C-band spectrum up for auction in the 3.7–3.98GHz range.

Verizon was quick to gobble up as much of that as it could paying a record $45 .4 billion in the auction. AT&T spent $23 billion to secure its piece and T-Mobile dropped $9.3 billion for a smaller portion that would be used to augment its existing 2.5GHz Ultra Capacity network.

However this new spectrum was much more valuable to Verizon and AT&T since it finally let them play in the mid-band club. Better yet these higher frequencies potentially offer even greater capacity than T-Mobile’s 2.5GHz spectrum albeit at slightly shorter ranges.

Following a heated controversy with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the airline industry over whether these signals would interfere with aircraft instruments AT&T and Verizon finally got the green light to switch on their C-band spectrum in January 2022.

Customers saw marked performance improvements right out of the gate. This was especially true for those on Verizon since the carrier immediately rolled out the new C-band spectrum to 100 million people in 1700 cities. By comparison AT&T limited its initial C-band rollouts to only eight urban centers preferring to defer a wider C-band rollout until later this year when it can take advantage of some less controversial 3.45–3.55GHz C-band spectrum it acquired in a later auction.

The 5G landscape today

While T-Mobile still holds a commanding lead this is due mainly to the big head start it had in rolling out its midrange coverage in the first place. A study comparing 5G enhanced services on equal footing shows that T-Mobile and Verizon customers get roughly the same performance when using their carriers’ best 5G networks — the mid-band ones.

However the much broader coverage of T-Mobile’s 5G Ultra Capacity network means more customers will experience its fastest download speeds pushing up the nationwide median compared to Verizon. It’s fair to say these numbers will get more balanced as Verizon expands its 5G Ultra Wideband coverage to more cities.

Similarly AT&T remains in last place as it’s taking a much more measured approach to its 5G rollouts but that will also change once it starts switching on more 5G Plus sites later this year and it should be more of a contender by 2023.

The good news is that this year we’ve moved past most of the challenges from the early days of 5G. Today all three nationwide carriers have mature 5G networks that leverage all three frequency ranges — low-band in rural areas mid-band in most cities and mmWave in dense urban locations — to provide the best possible 5G service. The question is no longer about whether a given carrier provides better 5G service than its rivals — T-Mobile’s 5G UC Verizon’s 5G UW or AT&T’s 5G+ are all neck-in-neck for performance — but simply if those fastest 5G networks are available where you live and work.

Okay so the OnePlus 10 series has been a bit of a disappointment for old fans and newcomers alike. Even the latest OnePlus 10T hasn’t shaken off what has been a bit of a dud year for the once plucky underdog. But don’t despair; there’s never been a better time to pick up a OnePlus smartphone. Just turn your attention to the previous generation OnePlus 9 Pro.

Granted the handset wasn’t a flawless ten when we reviewed it last year. OnePlus never quite sticks the landing at launch but the OnePlus 9 Pro has matured well over the past twelve months especially after a few software patches and the fact that it now retails with a significantly cheaper price tag. Did you know that you can pick up the OnePlus 9 Pro for just $599 through the official US store? That’s a major discount on the $969 launch price and cheaper than its subsequent $799 revaluation. You can even find international models with T-Mobile 5G support for under $500 new on eBay and the like. That’s a pretty good deal in anyone’s book.

In terms of hardware there’s still a lot going for the OnePlus 9 Pro and the smaller OnePlus 9 for that matter. The display remains as excellent today as it was last year the Snapdragon 888 processor performs as well as the current-gen Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 for most everyday needs it sports blazing fast wired and wireless charging and there’s an IP68 rating — something neither OnePlus 10 phones have. It’s an attractive phone too and it retains the signature alert slider that you won’t find on this year’s models either.

That’s all pretty competitive with the OnePlus 10 Pro yet it costs just two-thirds of its price. Yes the OnePlus 10T is newer and quite tempting at $649 but it suffers a few too many compromises in a bid to cut costs such as a weaker IP54 rating (and even that is limited to the US) no alert slider no wireless charging and a cheaper design. Fans may lament that the newer models haven’t meaningfully built on the 9 Pro’s legacy.

Robert Triggs / Android Authority

For instance the OnePlus 9 Pro’s Hasselblad-branded camera array (part of a partnership that has seemingly moved over to OPPO for now) is still pretty solid and actually performs better than the cameras in the newer 10 series in some areas. The OnePlus 10T for instance has taken a big backward step in ultrawide image quality; a major mark against the handset. Sure the OnePlus 9 Pro’s camera array won’t blow the very best camera phones out of the water but there’s a reliable main and ultrawide duo on offer here that continue to hold their own. There are similarly robust selfie imaging and video recording capabilities as well; it’s not like 4K/60fps or 8K/30fps are going out of fashion anytime soon.

It's an older model but the OnePlus 9 Pro still holds its own against its younger siblings.

Perhaps better still OnePlus has refreshed its long-term update policy since the phone’s launch. There are two OS upgrades and three years of security patches still to come which is not bad given you’d be leaping in a year late. Of course you could buy an inexpensive mid-range model from Google or Samsung that’ll see four to five years of support left but the OnePlus 9 Pro is a nicer piece of kit overall. It was an excellent phone at launch still great six months later and remains a good buy today. That said there are one or two caveats to consider.

Robert Triggs / Android Authority

The lingering concern is what OnePlus’ software will look like going forward. The brand’s revamped OxygenOS UI now built on the same codebase as sister-brand OPPO’s Color OS has resulted in contention and tangible issues in equal measure. Things have gradually improved with incremental updates to Oxygen OS 12 but the fruits of OPPO’s collaboration won’t be fully felt until the next update with Oxygen OS 13 which is shaping up to look quite different. OnePlus has responded trying to win old fans back around with a promise to “deliver an experience that long-time OnePlus users will be familiar with.” Unfortunately the OnePlus 9 series is caught in the middle of a major OS transition that could fundamentally change the look and feel of the handset’s core identity over the coming years.

OnePlus' 9 Pro still embodies the marriage of hardware and software that fans have come to love.

Even at $599 there are other good buys to consider too. The Samsung Galaxy S22 ($799) is perhaps worth stretching for in terms of newer hardware and longer-term support that’ll last until 2027. At a more like-for-like price the Google Pixel 6 ($599) is a solid shooter offers sleek software and has a long-term update pledge that makes it hard to beat for the money. However these phones don’t carry the same charm as a classic OnePlus phone. Yes they’re well-built all-rounders but neither Google nor Samsung brandishes the little eccentricities that have kept OnePlus fans standing by the series for so long whether that’s blazing fast charging the little alert slider or a favorite software feature.

Despite its quirks and controversies the OnePlus 9 Pro still embodies that sought-after signature marriage of hardware and software. Based on the way things are going perhaps this is a fan’s last chance to grab a true OnePlus flagship?

The moment you received your DD-214 it was officially an end of an era. Hopefully your branch won't fall victim like all those other weaker branches did. It's Lord of the Flies in here. New recruits are arriving in droves and they're pulling out their cell phones in basic training to record themselves talking back to their drill sergeants. If the drill sergeants have a problem with it they whip out their stress cards go back to eating their Tide Pods and continue listening to their music (which coincidentally has gotten progressively worse since your generation too).

I saw it on Facebook. It has to be a thing right? (Meme via US Army WTF Moments)

In case you couldn't tell that introduction was slathered in enough satire to make Duffel Blog proud. If it wasn't clear enough don't worry — stress cards weren't ever a real thing and only a handful of people actually ate Tide Pods to get attention on social media. The bit about cell phones however does have some basis in reality but it's nowhere near as overblown as you might think. First of all phone calls are still a privilege (not a right) that's dispensed at the discretion of the drill sergeant. If the drill sergeant says ""no phones this week"" that's the final word.

Just like the old days... Or you know like the Marines... (Photo by Lance Cpl. Aaron Bolser)

Which leads directly into the next concern shared by many millennial-fearing vets. Let's set the record straight: No. Privates in Basic are not allowed to keep their cell phones on them at all times. When Soldiers are allowed to use their phones usually on a Sunday night they follow the same rules as they were ""back in the day"" with pay phones. This time around however instead of allowing a line to form behind the phone drill sergeants simply free recruits' phones from lock-up. Drill sergeants still monitor all phone use and often restrict photography texting and social media usage. If the recruits can send texts or check Facebook it is entirely because the drill sergeant saw fit to reward them with such privilege. If the recruits are not allowed then it's just standard voice calls (wait — do phones still have a ""voice call"" feature?). Either way once their extremely short lease on phone time is spent the phones are locked back up until the privilege is earned again.

The standards have never (and will never) change. Only technology has.

The amount of pay phones in operation has dropped 95% since 1999 and a good portion of those that remain are in New York City. The pay phone business is far too dated to remain competitive in today's world but the need for trainees to inform their family that they ""just got here"" and that they're ""doing fine"" hasn't magically evaporated. So yes. The military is an ever-changing ever-adapting beast but the high level of professionalism that you grew to love hasn't been destroyed by the rise of cell phones."

Until about 15 years ago places like Block and Point street were forbidden to casual observers — they were off limits a no-go zone because what went on there was dangerous.

The site was once a busy working dirty waterfront. Ships called at Jenkins’s and Kerr’s wharves. There was also industry — the Lacy Iron Foundry Baltimore Pulverizing Co. and the Baltimore Chrome Works which went on to become Baugh Chemicals and Allied Signal.

It was a neighborhood of gritty coal yards and acres of lumber depots.

Construction in downtown Baltimore at Harbor Point and Harbor East.

All that changed for good as this 27-acre parcel now called Harbor Point underwent a dramatic transformation. It began sprouting new office and apartment buildings about 12 years ago and this summer the pile drivers and heavy equipment are at work on the new T. Rowe Price Building actually two separate seven-story pavilions connected by a glass lobby-atrium.

T. Rowe Price has set a high standard of sustainability. It is going for LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) platinum status for the working quarters. And because it’s going up along the harbor shoreline the structure requires more than 600 steel piles.

T. Rowe estimates that 2500 persons will occupy the buildings set around a 4.5-acre public waterfront park. It will take two years for this waterfront business campus to be completed.

Harbor Point grows incrementally and it’s always worth a visit if only to realize just how dramatically Baltimore changes. Some might say you don’t know you’re in Baltimore but really isn’t Little Italy just a short stroll away?

The summer of 2022 is interesting from a physical development standpoint. The pandemic seems to be in the past. Pennsylvania Station is encased in scaffolding. A new Lexington Market is getting ready to open. The first parking garage is going up at the old Perkins Homes site in Southeast Baltimore.

Port Covington is taking shape on the Middle Branch of the Patapsco River and here at Harbor Point another component is just beginning to come out of the ground.

Harbor Point is not a neighborhood in the sense of a Hamilton or Upton although its roots are as old as Baltimore itself. Situated off Central Avenue between the Inner Harbor and Fells Point Harbor Point’s roots go back to the 1770s when Baltimore was establishing itself as a trading port.

Recent arrivals include the office and hotel building called Wills Wharf. It is a neighbor to the Exelon headquarters. There are plenty of apartments with amazing views of the city and a busy Whole Foods market in the Liberty Harbor East tower.

Harbor Point is strictly the new Baltimore of glass and steel built high. It’s organized and clean. There is a landscaped central park area where the sodded grass looks as if it were grown in a laboratory. The trees are perfectly groomed.

“We wanted our park to feel good and welcoming” said Chris Seiler of Beatty Development Group Harbor Point’s developer. “Since the pandemic ended we’ve seen people back outdoors and hanging out. It’s exciting to see signs of something like normal.”

If you’re looking for a fine view of Baltimore’s amazing harbor this is the place for oohs and ahs. I found myself spotting the old familiar landmarks — the steeple of St. Mary’s Star of the Sea Church across the water on Riverside Avenue in Federal Hill the Domino Sugar sign and Tide Point.

Photo: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com

Amazon-backed electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Rivian Automotive (RIVN) has seen plenty of short seller interest in its short history as a publicly-listed company.

The company listed in November 2021 amid much fanfare. However in 2022 its share price has fallen over 50% while the number of RIVN shares shorted has nearly doubled since the end of 2021.

The increased short sellers’ interest has seen short squeezes in Rivian giving the EV stock some respite from sell-offs. Rivian’s stock surged over 30% in July to see its best month to date after the company announced that it was on track to meet its production target for 2022.

Will there be another Rivian short squeeze? Here we take a look at the stock and the factors affecting its share price movement.

What is a short squeeze?

Stock traders can make a profit from the falling price of a security by shorting-selling. A trader opens a short position by borrowing shares of a stock in anticipation that it will fall in price. They then sell the borrowed shares and buy them back after the share price has fallen.

Short selling does not always go according to plan. If the market goes against the short seller’s position a heavily-shorted stock price may rise and force short sellers to cut their losses and exit their positions.

Short sellers rushing for the exit have to buy back borrowed shares from the market which can result in a further rise in the price. Rising asset prices attract new buyers. This combination of new buyers and panicked short sellers boosts demand and price of the stock resulting in a short squeeze.

What is Rivian?

Rivian Automotive is an electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer based in California. The company specialises in making electric pickup trucks. It’s delivered two models the R1T and R1S as of mid-2022.

Rivian also aims to serve the commercial market and has launched the Rivian Commercial Vehicle platform in collaboration with e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN). The company is developing the Rivian Commercial Van (EDV) a long-range electric commercial step-in van of which Amazon has placed an initial order of 100000 vehicles for global deployment according to the company’s annual 10-K filing.

“Under the EDV Agreement we have granted Amazon certain exclusivity and first refusal rights which will initially restrict our ability to contract with other commercial customers” said Rivian.

Amazon Ford Motor (F) and T. Rowe Price Group are the top shareholders in Rivian. According to data compiled by Fintel Amazon held a 18.1% stake in Rivian Ford 11.4% and T. Rowe Price 18.1% as of February 2022.

Rivian stock listed on Nasdaq in November 2021 at an initial public offering (IPO) price of $78 a share. The company’s listing raised proceeds worth over $13.5bn.

As of 1 August 2022 Rivian stock price was trading 64% lower compared to its IPO price of $78. The stock’s all-time high stood at $179.47 which it hit on 16 November 2021.

According to the company’s annual filing it produced 1015 vehicles and delivered 920 in 2021.

Rivian short squeeze: Best monthly performance in July

Rivian Automotive stock has attracted a significant amount of short-selling interest in its short history as a publicly-listed stock which later contributed to the Rivian short squeeze. According to data compiled by MarketBeat Rivian short interest on 15 July 2022 stood at $1.7bn representing 11% of the company’s shares.

In comparison Rivian’s foreign automobile industry peers saw little to no short interest with Chinese EV makers Li Auto and NIO and Europe-based Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz Group seeing zero short interest in the same period according to MarketBeat.

Short interest in US-based EV makers remained high as data showed. Lucid Group’s (LCID) 23.8% shares were sold short and Tesla (TSLA) short interest stood at $17bn (2.74% of the shares) as of 15 July 2022.

However with high short interest comes a high chance of fortunes reversing for the shorted stock in the event of a short squeeze.

The second week of July saw a Rivian stock short squeeze as share prices surged nearly 25% after the company announced that it was on track to deliver its annual production guidance of 25000 vehicles.

Rivian also announced on 6 July that it had produced 4401 vehicles and delivered 4467 in the June quarter. The figures were an improvement on 2553 manufactured and 1227 delivered in the March quarter.

The upbeat production announcement and RIVN stock short squeeze helped the stock post its best monthly gain since its debut month. RIVN stock gained 33% in July from an opening price of $25.9 to a close of $34.3.

Traders wanting to short Rivian stock will have to watch out for the company’s June quarter financial results scheduled to be released on 11 August 2022.

Furthermore the company will also be reducing its headcount by 6% in order to reduce costs as reported by Reuters citing an internal email sent by Rivian chief executive RJ Scaringe.

Rivian will focus on its R1 models and the EDV and speed up development and launch of future products over the next 18 months Reuters said..

Investment banks Goldman Sachs JP Morgan & Chase and Citigroup are among a number of institutional investors and funds who have short positions in Rivian Automotive as of 15 July according to MarketBeat.

Analysis: RIVN short interest continues to rise

Data showed that the value of Rivian short interest has eased in 2022 coming down from over $3bn on 31 December 2021 to $1.7bn on 15 July 2022. However there is more the numbers need a closer inspection to get an accurate picture about the potential RIVN short squeeze.

The fall in the value of Rivian short interest in 2022 is due the plunge in Rivian share prices. RIVN stock has lost over 67% from an open price of about $106 on 1 January 2022 to nearly $34 by the end of July 2022.

Instead short seller data showed the total number of RIVN shares shorted has increased from 29.37 million shares on 31 December 2021 to 53.64 million on 15 July 2022 with the percentage of float shorted jumping from 1.1% to 11% in the period.

According to data analytics firm 2iQ short-sellers have been targeting Rivian due to supply chain problems capital needs and high valuations. In March 2022 Rivian cut its 2022 production guidance in half from 50000 vehicles to 25000 vehicles citing that “supply chain will be a fundamental limiting factor in our total output” throughout 2022.

Ed Sheldon and Suhaib Haider of 2iQ noted that the company will “most likely” have to raise capital for funding production. “And with interest rates rising the cost of capital is going up” they said.

“Finally there’s the valuation. Rivian has only produced a handful of vehicles so far yet it has a market capitalisation of $34.9 billion. Assuming it can hit analysts’ 2022 revenue forecast of $2.01 billion the stock’s price-to-sales ratio is 23. That’s high” added the duo.

Rivian stock predictions for 2022

According to analyst ratings on Rivian Automotive compiled by Wall Street Journal as of 5 August 10 of 17 analysts rated RIVN stock “buy” and six “hold”. The average Rivian stock prediction stood at $52.57 with the high of $108 and low of $24.

Deutsche Bank lowered its RIVN price target from $69 to $46 and Morgan Stanley cut its RIVN price target from $85 to $60 in their latest reports on the company.

Meanwhile CNN-compiled data of 14 analysts as of 1 August revealed a median 12-month Rivian price forecast of $45 with a high estimate of $108 and a low estimate of $24.

Note that analysts' views on the outlook for the stock or RIVN short squeeze can be wrong. Forecasts shouldn’t be used as a substitute for your own research. Always conduct your own due diligence and remember that your decision to trade or invest should depend on your risk tolerance expertise in the market portfolio size and goals.

Gaza has a population of about 2.3 million people living in five governorates: North Gaza Gaza City Deir el-Balah Khan Younis and Rafah.

Bordered by Israel and Egypt on the Mediterranean coast the strip is about 365 square kilometres (141sq miles). At only 41km (25 miles) long it can take less than an hour to drive from Rafah in the south to Beit Hanoon in the north.

In the following series of maps Al Jazeera takes you on a journey across Gaza’s five governorates highlighting key locations including hospitals schools universities UN compounds refugee camps crossings and other vital infrastructure.

Sixteen years of Israeli blockade

Since 2008 Israel has waged four wars on the Palestinian territory killing thousands of people mostly civilians. During Israel’s last offensive on Gaza Israeli attacks killed at least 256 people including 66 children and wounded 2000 according to the United Nations.

The 11-day assault damaged at least 51 education facilities including 46 schools two kindergartens a United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) training centre and parts of the Islamic University of Gaza according to the UN.

Israeli raids also damaged at least six hospitals and 11 primary healthcare centres including Gaza’s only COVID-19 testing laboratory.

North Gaza

The district of North Gaza shares a 10km (6 miles) long border with Israel. The Gaza Strip is surrounded by a heavily fortified perimeter consisting of a concrete wall and double-wired fencing. Anyone who steps within 1km (0.6 miles) of this barrier is in danger of being shot by the Israeli army which patrols Gaza’s northern and eastern borders.

The Beit Hanoon crossing known as Erez to Israelis and managed by the Israeli army is Gaza’s only northern crossing into Israel. From there Palestinians with special permits – usually for urgent medical treatment – are allowed to leave Gaza on their way to Jerusalem or the West Bank. Gaza is only about 100km (62 miles) from Jerusalem but because of tight security measures it becomes several hours of journey. Since 2007 Israel has imposed a sea and air blockade of Gaza.

North Gaza is home to the largest refugee camp in the Strip. The Jabalia refugee camp covers an area of 1.4sq km (0.5sq miles) and with a population of 114000 it is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.

Gaza City

Gaza City is the largest and most populous city within the Gaza Strip with more than 700000 residents. Rimal Shujaiya and Tel al-Hawa are among its most well-known neighbourhoods.

At the heart of the Rimal neighbourhood is Al Shifa Hospital – the largest medical facility in the Gaza Strip.

Surrounding the hospital are several UN compounds including UNRWA the Office of the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process (UNSCO) and the UN Development Programme (UNDP). Gaza’s top universities – including the Islamic University of Gaza Al-Azhar University – Gaza and the Al-Aqsa University which are just a few hundred metres apart – are also located in the Rimal neighbourhood.

The Shati refugee camp also known as Beach Camp is located along Gaza’s Mediterranean coastline and is the third-largest out of the Gaza Strip’s eight camps.

Deir el-Balah

Named after the “Monastery of the Date Palm” Deir el-Balah is one of Gaza’s largest agricultural producers. It is also home to four refugee camps: Nuseirat Al Bureij Al Maghazi and Deir el-Balah.

Gaza’s only operating power plant is located along the district’s boundary with Gaza City. For the past 10 years the Gaza Strip has suffered from chronic electricity shortages which have severely affected its ability to provide essential services including health water and sanitation services manufacturing and agriculture.

Only 5 percent of Gaza’s water is safe to drink and 68 percent of its population suffers from food insecurity according to the UN.

Khan Younis

The district of Khan Younis is home to some 400000 people. At its centre is the Khan Younis refugee camp home to about 87000 people.

In 2005 nearly 8000 Jewish settlers and Israeli soldiers living in 21 settlements around Gaza were relocated mostly to the occupied West Bank following a decision by then-Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to unilaterally disengage from the Gaza Strip. Most of these settlements were in Khan Younis.

Israel claimed its occupation of Gaza since 1967 has ended as it has pulled its troops and settlers from the territory but international law views Gaza as an occupied territory because Israel has full control over Gaza’s borders airspace and territorial waters.

Rafah

Rafah is the southernmost district of Gaza with a population of more than 250000. The district is best known for the crossing with Egypt that bears its name.

Both Israel and Egypt have kept their borders largely shut and are responsible for further deteriorating the already-weakened economic and humanitarian situation.

In 2020 the Rafah crossing and the Erez crossing into Israel were open for only 125 days according to the UN. Palestinians who wish to leave must apply for a limited number of passes to leave the Gaza Strip. This process may take weeks or months depending on the status of the border.

Those who are able to get through the Rafah crossing must then make a six-to-eight-hour journey through the Sinai Desert passing several Egyptian checkpoints on their way to Cairo about 400km (250 miles) away. Rafah’s second crossing into Egypt is the Salah al-Din gate which is used for transporting goods.

The third crossing from Rafah is the Israeli-controlled Karem Abu Salem crossing known as Kerem Shalom to Israelis.

Gaza has no functional airports after Israel bombed and demolished the Yasser Arafat International Airport in 2001 only three years after it opened.

Gaza again is the scene of widespread destruction and human suffering and remains the place often described as “the world’s largest open-air prison”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL3JlZC1kZWFkLXJlZGVtcHRpb24tZ3Vhcm1hLXJvY2tzdGFyLXRyb3BpY2FsLXNvdXRoLWFtZXJpY2Etc2V0dGluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Red Dead Redemption's Strangest Chapter is Proof Rockstar Should Pursue a South American Game,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL3JlZC1kZWFkLXJlZGVtcHRpb24tZ3Vhcm1hLXJvY2tzdGFyLXRyb3BpY2FsLXNvdXRoLWFtZXJpY2Etc2V0dGluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2dyYW5kLXRoZWZ0LWF1dG8tNi1ib25uaWUtY2x5ZGUtYmFycm93LWdhbmctaGVpc3RzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Grand Theft Auto 6's Bonnie and Clyde Inspirations Could Lead to Interesting Heists,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2dyYW5kLXRoZWZ0LWF1dG8tNi1ib25uaWUtY2x5ZGUtYmFycm93LWdhbmctaGVpc3RzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,

Data shows that the current sentiment on Main Street is pessimistic. The latest CNBC|SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey for Q3 2022 showed that small business confidence hit an all-time low with the largest percentage of small businesses citing inflation as their biggest risk.

""As a small business owner on a tight budget ... you don't even need the really heavy duty AI which I think a lot of small business owners they get a little bit nervous. ... You can actually make a lot of gains with really simple solutions"" Sanders said ""When you're a small business you have an end-to-end control that a large business doesn't have. I see this as a really big opportunity"" she added.

""What I'm seeing with the big companies they're trying to hire futurists and trying to figure out ways to actually predict demand. But every time we look at the numbers the Consumer Price Index all of it we're looking backwards"" Sanders said. ""The fact of the matter is we're in a very quickly changing landscape and I think we have to look forward. Small business owners really need to connect and use judgment to forecast and to understand what their customers need.""

Whether a small business is B2B or B2C Sanders said direct communication is a ""real answer"" for them right now in dealing with changing consumer behavior.

This gives small business owners who can connect directly with customers to understand what their needs are a potential advantage that can't be calculated by an algorithm.

Her opinion is that the biggest companies have become too reliant on inventory algorithms to forecast data but in the current economy which has defied many historical patterns ""historical data in this space right now isn't really good data. It's not clean data it doesn't indicate the future that is very volatile"" she said.

""The big companies are really struggling with that"" Sanders who is an academic expert on forecasting said. ""We see it obviously with the retailers. Walmart Target.""

She cites three areas where entrepreneurs should be focused and the first is directly related to the big box retailer woes: forecasting.

That's the advice from Nada Sanders Northeastern University distinguished professor of supply chain management. She told CNBC's Small Business Playbook virtual summit on Wednesday that she has been ""gloom and doom"" in the past but is now optimistic about Main Street's chances in the current economy.

The inventory builds and subsequent markdowns from the biggest retailers including Walmart and Target show that even the best can get this consumer economy wrong. In fact small business owners being closer to relationships on both the supply and customer ends may be able to more nimbly manage a fast-changing environment.

The retail battle narrative over the past few decades has cited one of two wars: Amazon and e-commerce against the big bricks-and-mortar retailers and everybody big against small Main Street entrepreneurs. But in the current confusing economic environment — marked by inflation supply chain bottlenecks and a volatile consumer changing spending patterns due to the high prices which followed Covid — small business experts say that Main Street should be more optimistic about the advantages of being small.

In the Q3 survey an increasing percentage of small businesses forecast a sales decline over the next 12 months as the economy in their view is already in a recession. The downbeat sales outlook was the biggest contributor to the all-time low in confidence being hit. And as small businesses face higher costs in inputs labor transportation and energy few (only 13%) say now is a good time to pass along price increases to customers according to the survey.

How to set pricing during inflation

But pricing is also an area where small businesses can effectively and directly communicate with their customers and find solutions.

Jeffrey Robinson Rutgers Business School provost and executive vice-chancellor and co-founder of the Center for Urban Entrepreneurship and Economic Development said at the Small Business Playbook virtual summit that one big mistake business owners make is to not figure out pricing on new products until it is too late. At a time of high inflation entrepreneurs need to be basing any pricing of new items on a detailed analysis of the costs that go into producing it. A traditional way that businesses set pricing — decide on the product and then once it is available look at what competitors are charging — is not the way to operate in this economy. Inflation requires that small business owners set price by first and foremost understanding their costs.

""All those prices along the supply chain have gone up"" Robinson said. ""The shipping costs ... anything that has any component of transportation involved those costs have gone up. So assessing and valuing your product or service that you're providing along those costs before you set the price allows you to set the price at the right level"" he said.

And then comes the hard part: explaining it to the customer. Robinson says the direct relationship that small businesses have with their customers should be seen as an advantage too.

""We have relationships. Talk"" he said. ""Explore. You've got to explain to them that the costs have gone up for these components. 'In order for me to do this I have to change some pricing'"" he said.

Helping customers understand the situation that a business is in related to supply chain inflation is going to help set prices in an appropriate way he said. In the end Robinson said it is really no different than a restaurant that has always shown the price of a fish on the menu to be ""market price."" That may be a simplified example but it has reverberated in the current situation.

Some restaurants have put signs out front during the current inflationary period to be transparent with customers about pricing changes. Robinson didn't weigh in on that method specifically but did say every business needs to have some form of conversation with customers and potential customers about the fact that the prices of two years ago are not going to be the prices of today. While the survey data shows that small business owners are wary of this conversation Robinson said they shouldn't be.

""I believe a lot of consumers understand that especially if you're a business-to-consumer type of business"" he said. ""It's about being transparent ... helping people understand that pricing is changing.""

Map out the supply chain with key vendors

The conversation with suppliers is no less important and Sanders said the data shows that on average 80% of a company's spend goes towards about 6% of their suppliers. Those are the business partners to focus on and where to pick up the phone and call and build a relationship. ""As a small company this is really what it's going to be about"" Sanders said. ""What I think you need to do as a small company is really be able to map your supply chain for your key items talk to your vendors really build partnerships"" she said.

Most big companies don't have great visibility below their tier one suppliers according to Sanders so many items become harder to track that are far back in the supply chain ""tier four tier five"" she said.

A small business can map out its supply chain and work with partners to visualize the entire chain and identify the risks. Right now the inventory issues in retail might make small business owners more reluctant to stock up — even though it is the start of peak shopping season with back-to-school and then the holidays. Sanders said she is firm believer in running a ""lean"" operation but in the current economy ""we need to implement some caveats to the meaning of lean.""

In certain cases small businesses are going to have to store extra items critical items with longer lead times and where there are expected price increases. All businesses should also be taking a look at their production processes and whether alternatives exist that could lead to more cost-effective operations. Carrying extra inventories ""flies in the face of lean"" she said but she added ""the advantage for a small business is really being able to manage at the same time upstream and downstream and coordinate those.""

The biggest problem in the current economy is the mismatch between demand supply and that's where Sanders comes back to the issues Walmart and Target have faced and why small businesses should take an opportunistic view of the situation and be proactive about conversations on both the supply side and end customer side of their operations.

""Large companies are dinosaurs. ... They're very heavy bureaucratic. As a small business you're very limber"" she said.

The key for small business owners is to not only look one way either downstream (customer) or upstream (supplier). ""But look at those at the same time really marry those watch them and connect with customers connect with all the vendors"" Sanders said. ""Large companies can't do that. They're stuck because they have huge silos. As a small business you don't have that so leverage that right now.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8wNi9idXNpbmVzcy9jb3N0Y28ta2lya2xhbmQtc2lnbmF0dXJlLXRyYWRlci1qb2VzLXN0b3JlLWJyYW5kcy9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFeaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8wOC8wNi9idXNpbmVzcy9jb3N0Y28ta2lya2xhbmQtc2lnbmF0dXJlLXRyYWRlci1qb2VzLXN0b3JlLWJyYW5kcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The hidden makers of Costco's Kirkland Signature and Trader Joe's O's,"New York CNN Business —

Kirkland Signature. Two-Buck Chuck. Simple Truth. Cat & Jack. Great Value. Amazon Basics. Store brands have never been more popular.

They have become forces in their own right and make up around 21% of sales in the $1.17 trillion US grocery industry according to IRI.

As prices surge store brands – also known as private labels white labels or generic brands – have become an even more attractive option for inflation-fatigued shoppers who are looking to switch from pricier name brands. Store brands can be anywhere from 10% to 50% cheaper.

But the origins of store brands remain largely secretive.

Retailers aren’t typically forthcoming about the companies that make their brands. And manufacturers likewise have little incentive to reveal that they’re creating similar products to their name brands under a different label sold on the cheap.

Many leading national brand manufacturers create private labels for multiple retailers. In the late 1990s more than half of brand manufacturers were estimated to make private goods as well.

Although store brands ostensibly compete with manufacturers’ national brands manufacturers often have excess capacity on their production lines. To generate additional profit some will use that extra capacity to make private labels.

Other brand manufacturers will produce private labels as an incentive for retailers hoping they’ll be rewarded with better shelf space and placement for their own national labels.

“Most manufacturers aren’t open about it” said Jan-Benedict E.M. Steenkamp a marketing professor at the University of North Carolina who studies private labels and branding. “Manufacturers don’t want it to be known because it undermines the power of their own brands.”

But there are some exceptions. Kimberly-Clark (KMB) the maker of Huggies diapers produces Kirkland Signature diapers for Costco (COST)and Duracell produces Kirkland Signature batteries Costco (COST)executives have said.

Georgia-Pacific the maker of Brawny and Dixie also produces store brands. So does Henkel (HENKY) the manufacturer of Purex and Dial.

Eight O’Clock Coffee and Kenmore

Store labels have been around since the early days of retail and the emergence of consumer brands in the 19th century.

Macy’s sold stoneware whiskey jugs under its own name. Customers could bring back the jugs for refills according to Christopher Durham the president of the Velocity Institute a trade association for private brands.

Montgomery Ward developed its own line of aspirin in wooden containers while the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. (aka A&P) sold branded spices with the slogan “Take the Grandmother’s Advice Use A&P Spices.” A&P later developed Eight O’Clock Coffee one of the most famous private labels of the period.

Yet no US retailer was more successful developing its own brands than Sears Roebuck.

In 1925 Sears created the Allstate brand for car tires. A few years later Sears launched its first Craftsman wrench according to Durham. Its Kenmore line which started as a sewing machine brand in 1913 before branching into vacuums and other home appliances became the leading home appliance brand in the United States.

These private labels were the exception however.

For most of the 20th century national brands such as Jell-O H.J. Heinz Campbell Soup (CPB) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) had power over stores. These manufacturers flooded the airwaves and newspapers with advertisements extolling the advantages of their products.

Most customers were fiercely loyal to specific brands not retailers. A store that didn’t carry major labels would likely get crushed which gave manufacturers immense leverage.

Additionally many store brands were also considered dull cheap knockoffs of national brands.

The low point of private label came during the 1970s Durham said when stores seeking to cut costs and rolled out generics with basic white backgrounds and black letters identifying the product – beer soap cola beans and other staples.

Shopper loyalty

Retailers make private label brands for a variety of reasons including to boost profitability and sometimes as a negotiating tool against brands.

Private brands often carry profit margins that are 20% to 40% higher than national brands because stores don’t have to pay the advertising distribution or other markup costs that are embedded in major brands’ prices.

In the mid-20th century many retailers started to develop their own labels to claw back bargaining power from dominant suppliers and keep their prices in check. As the US retail industry has consolidated in recent decades the power dynamic between retailers and suppliers reversed. Now stores have more leverage to introduce their own labels – whether name brands like it or not.

“Forty years ago Walmart pissing off P&G would be a risky situation. Now Walmart is much bigger than P&G” said Steenkamp the marketing professor.

Today stores’ private brand operations are more sophisticated than ever and a much bigger focus for chains.

Stores are likelier these days to develop a distinctive private brand or product to stand out against competitors and create shopper loyalty said Krishnakumar Davey the president of client engagement at IRI.

Costco (COST) for example will decide to make a Kirkland Signature product because a leading brand won’t sell to the retailer. Or Costco (COST) believes the name brand’s prices have gotten too high and it can make its own similar-quality product and sell it for 20% less.

Costco hasn’t lost any relationships with suppliers by launching its own Kirkland products but those brands are not usually pleased when Costco introduces one company CFO Richard Galanti said in an interview earlier this year.

Retailers have been sued for creating products that too closely resemble national brands. The owner of golf ball-brand Titleist sued Costco for patent infringement while Williams-Sonoma (WSM) sued Amazon (AMZN) for selling “knockoffs” under its own brand. Both cases were settled.

The US House Judiciary Committee and other lawmakers and regulators around the world have investigated whether Amazon uses data from sellers to create its own brands and unlawfully favors its own brands on its website.

Amazon has said it doesn’t use the data from individual third-party sellers to inform the development of its own private brands and does not favor its own products on the site.

Most stores start small with their own brands. Grocers for example will often first introduce a shelf-stable product like pasta flour sugar or rice that’s easier to make and where brand loyalty within the category isn’t strong.

“You don’t start with the most difficult things” Steenkamp said. “As stores build more experience and success then they enter new categories.”

How to find out who makes store brands

So how do you tell who’s behind your favorite store brands?

Product recalls are often the most revealing way to find out which brand manufacturers are behind specific private labels.

Last year for example Dole recalled fresh salads and vegetables including private brands for Walmart Kroger and H-E-B.

J.M. Smucker (SJM) recalled certain Jif peanut butter products this year as well as store-branded items it made for Giant Eagle Wawa and Safeway. Large companies such as Conagra and McCain Foods have recalled products from Trader Joe’s.

Then there are the dedicated private label manufacturers such as Treehouse Foods (THS) which makes snacks under the labels of supermarkets big-box chains and other retailers. Nearly one-quarter of the company’s $4.3 billion in sales last year for example came from Walmart (WMT).

Target has dozens of its own brands such as Cat & Jack Universal Thread and up & up. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

James Walser who led the launch of Target’s (TGT) up & up household basics and personal care brand in 2009 said that Target tried to move away from national brand manufacturers during up & up’s development to nimbler suppliers focused solely on making private labels.

Some large retailers also make their own private labels. Kroger for example makes about 30% of its own private products.

Perhaps the strangest store brand manufacturers are retailers that make private brands for their…competitors: Safeway-owned Lucerne Foods manufactures private labels for Safeway’s rivals.

The return of Toys R Us comes after the store closed its last two remaining stores in January 2021 after the coronavirus pandemic hit in-store sales. The brand previously struggled to make a comeback the year prior including teaming with Amazon to fulfill its orders.

For more than a century Wall Street has been a wealth-building machine for those who are patient. Over long periods high-quality companies and the indexes they're a part of tend to increase in value.

Something else that's commonplace on Wall Street is change. It's perfectly normal for innovation acquisitions competitive advantages and other factors to shake up the world's largest publicly traded companies on a fairly regular basis.

Just 18 years ago companies like General Electric AIG and Intel were among the 10 largest publicly traded companies by market cap. As of Aug. 4 Intel wasn't even in the top 50 any longer while GE and AIG had fallen out of the top 125 and top 250 respectively. Eight years from now in 2030 the stock market's 10 largest stocks could look vastly different than they do today.

While absolutely nothing is set in stone I predict that the following 10 stocks will have the largest market caps by 2030. Note that these 10 companies aren't listed in any particular order.

1. Berkshire Hathaway

The first stock conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.61%) (BRK.B 0.60%) should retain its spot in the top 10 even if billionaire CEO Warren Buffett isn't at the helm come 2030. After overseeing an average annual return on the company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of 20.1% since 1965 Buffett has clearly shown he's set his company up for long-term success.

One factor that makes Berkshire Hathaway such an incredible company is the mountain of passive income it collects every year. Over the next 12 months Buffett's company is expected to bring in well over $6 billion in dividend income with $4.25 billion coming from just a handful of companies. Because dividend stocks have a long history of outperforming nondividend payers holding these time-tested companies for years or decades provides an added boost.

2. Apple

Perhaps the least-surprising prediction is that the largest publicly traded company in the U.S. Apple (AAPL 1.00%) will remain in the top 10 largest stocks by market cap by 2030.

Aside from an easily recognized brand name and faithful customer base Apple's innovation is key to its success. Introducing a 5G-capable iPhone quickly pushed up its market share in the U.S. while CEO Tim Cook is busy leading a multiyear transition that emphasizes subscription services. Ultimately subscriptions should boost Apple's operating margins and lessen the sales volatility witnessed during product replacement cycles.

Apple has also repurchased $520 billion worth of its own common stock since the beginning of 2013. If this aggressive buyback program continues value investors are likely to continue plowing into Apple.

3. Visa

Payment processor Visa (V 0.49%) currently finds itself on the outside looking in (No. 11). By the turn of the decade I expect it to firmly find itself as one of the 10 largest companies by market cap.

Visa's opportunity for expansion is enormous. Most global transactions are still being conducted in cash which means it can expand organically into underbanked regions such as the Middle East Africa and Southeastern Asia or lean on acquisitions to grow (e.g. the Visa Europe buyout in 2016). Sustained double-digit annual growth should be the expectation throughout the decade.

What's more Visa strictly sticks to payment processing. Although the company would probably do just fine as a lender it would also expose Visa to potential loan delinquencies and losses during recessions. By avoiding lending Visa is able to bounce back from economic downturns faster than its peers and maintain a profit margin above 50%.

4. Alphabet

Another FAANG stock that has an exceptionally high likelihood of retaining its top-10 ranking by market cap come 2030 is Alphabet (GOOGL 0.34%) (GOOG 0.24%) the parent company of internet search engine Google and streaming platform YouTube.

Google has long been Alphabet's foundational operating segment. Over the past two years it's handled no less than 91% of global internet search share a big reason why Alphabet sports such incredible ad-pricing power. As traffic acquisition costs decline over time Google should continue to be a cash cow for the company.

But Alphabet's future is about its higher-growth initiatives like YouTube and Google Cloud. YouTube has grown into the second-most-visited social site in the world while Google Cloud has gobbled up 8% of global cloud infrastructure spending.

5. Salesforce

Cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software provider Salesforce (CRM -1.36%) could make one of the biggest leaps (currently No. 43) in terms of market cap by 2030. CRM software is what's used to help businesses enhance customer relationships and boost sales.

Global CRM software sales are expected to sustain double-digit growth through at least mid-decade which is great news for the industry's unquestioned leader. According to IDC Salesforce commanded a 23.8% share of CRM software spending in 2021 (over four times its next-closest competitor).

In addition to its commanding market share co-CEO and co-founder Marc Benioff has a penchant for making earnings-accretive acquisitions. These deals broaden the Salesforce ecosystem and help with the company's cross-selling opportunities.

6. Amazon

E-commerce stock Amazon (AMZN 0.80%) is another really strong bet to retain its spot in among the 10 largest stocks by the turn of the decade.

Most folks know Amazon for its industry-leading online marketplace. In 2022 eMarketer projects that Amazon will account for 39.5% of all U.S. online retail sales. But the real crown jewel is the more than 200 million Prime members who've signed up as a result of its leading marketplace. The fees collected from Prime members help Amazon expand its logistics network and reinvest in high-growth initiatives.

There's also Amazon Web Services (AWS) which is the global No. 1 in cloud infrastructure spending with 33% market share. Corporate cloud spending is still in its early innings which means Amazon's operating cash flow could skyrocket in the years ahead.

7. PayPal Holdings

The company I predict will make the biggest leap into the top 10 stocks by market cap is fintech giant PayPal Holdings (PYPL 1.00%). PayPal is currently No. 88 with a $112 billion market cap.

Digital payments are still in their infancy which bodes well for fee-based payment platforms. Even with U.S. gross domestic product declining in back-to-back quarters PayPal's total payment volume on its network continues to grow by a double-digit percentage on a constant-currency basis.

Arguably even more important active users are more engaged than ever. At the end of 2020 active users were completing 40.9 transactions over the trailing 12 months (ttm). This figure is up to 48.7 transactions per active account on a ttm basis through June 2022 and it continues to climb.

8. Microsoft

Software kingpin Microsoft (MSFT 0.43%) the only company from the 10 largest stocks by market cap in 1999 to still have a top-10 position today has a good shot at sustaining its dominance throughout the decade.

Microsoft's success is a function of raking in mammoth amounts of cash flow from its legacy operations and funneling this cash into faster-growing projects. For instance even though its high-margin Windows franchise is generally a slow grower it still accounts for a 76% share of global desktop operating systems.

Microsoft is utilizing this cash flow to reinvest in a variety of cloud initiatives -- Azure is the global No. 2 in cloud infrastructure spending and grew sales by 46% on a constant-currency basis in the June-ended quarter -- and fuel acquisitions. For instance Microsoft offered $68.7 billion to acquire gaming company Activision Blizzard in January.

9. Chevron

Despite a feverish renewable energy push by most developed countries I predict oil and gas major Chevron (CVX 1.79%) will find its way into 10 largest publicly traded companies by market cap in 2030.

The biggest reason for this push is the expectation that oil and natural gas prices will remain elevated for many years to come. The pandemic resulted in multiple years of reduced domestic and international drilling and pipeline investment. Couple this with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and you'll see there's a clear risk to global energy supply.

Chevron is also in excellent financial shape compared to most other integrated oil stocks. By prudently deploying its capital and minimizing debt Chevron has been able to maintain its superior dividend repurchase its own stock and fund key natural gas projects in the Asia-Pacific region.

10. Meta Platforms

Lastly social media stock Meta Platforms (META 0.60%) the company formerly known as Facebook should find itself as one of the 10 largest stocks in 2030. You'll note that current top-10 stocks Tesla (TSLA -1.57%) UnitedHealth Group (UNH 0.76%) Nvidia (NVDA -1.84%) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 0.60%) didn't make the cut.

Although social media usage statistics can be extremely fickle to project one year in advance let alone in eight years Meta has four of the most downloaded apps in the world. On a combined basis Facebook Instagram WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger attracted 3.65 billion monthly active users in the June-ended quarter. That's over half the global adult population and a big reason why Facebook's ad-pricing power is exceptionally strong more often than not.

The wild card is the company's metaverse ambitions the ""metaverse"" being the next iteration of the internet that allows connected users to interact with each other and their surroundings in a 3D virtual environment. It will be years before the necessary infrastructure is in place to support the metaverse. But once there Meta's hefty investments could make it a key player in this potentially $30 trillion opportunity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVucXVlZW4uY29tLmhrL2FzaWFzLXRvcC1jdWx0aXZhdGVkLXNlYWZvb2QtY29tcGFuaWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Who Will Asia's Biggest Cultivated Seafood Players Be?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVucXVlZW4uY29tLmhrL2FzaWFzLXRvcC1jdWx0aXZhdGVkLXNlYWZvb2QtY29tcGFuaWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D8393F6A0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVucXVlZW4uY29tLmhrL2FzaWFzLXRvcC1jdWx0aXZhdGVkLXNlYWZvb2QtY29tcGFuaWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Tesla’s autopilot and self-driving claims are under fire again this time from the California Department of Motor Vehicles in a complaint it filed on July 28.

The complaint alleges that the company made “untrue or misleading” statements in advertisements on its website by claiming that Tesla vehicles were or could be equipped with advanced driver assistance system features.

The Tesla (TSLA) advertisements ran in marketing materials on the company’s website “on at least five dates” between May 2021 and July 2022 the complaint said.

They included descriptions such as “Autopilot” and “Full Self-Driving Capability” and used such wording as “All you will need to do is get in and tell your car where to go…Your Tesla will figure out the optimal route navigating urban streets complex intersections and freeways” the suit said.

Another claim that the California DMV alleged was misleading said “The system is designed to be able to conduct short and long-distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver’s seat.”

“These advertisements are a deceptive practice” under California’s Civil Code the DMV complaint said.

Tesla does not typically respond to requests for comment.

Tesla has published disclaimers from as recently as June warning the features still require active driver supervision which contradict the “misleading labels and claims” the complaint added.

Tesla’s advertising actions could cause it to temporarily lose its manufacturer license and special plates number in California the complaint warned.

Data released in June by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found there were 273 crashes in the last nine months involving Tesla driver-assist technologies caused by either its “full self-driving” software or its precursor Tesla Autopilot.

Of 497 total crashes studied by the NHTSA 43% of those caused by driver-assist technologies took place in California the data found.

Tesla’s Autopilot feature comes standard in all of its vehicles making it one of the industry’s most commonly used autopilot systems. While Tesla reminds drivers to stay alert while using it a 2021 MIT study revealed that users who used the system were more distracted and looked away from the road more often than when they were driving without the feature.

Tesla has 15 days to respond to the complaint in order to avoid a default decision.

The department said this complaint is separate from an ongoing review of the intended design and technological capabilities of Tesla vehicles.

The Los Angeles Times was first news outlet to report the complaint.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGV2ZXJnZS5jb20vMjAyMi84LzYvMjMyOTQ2NTgvY2FsaWZvcm5pYS1kbXYtYWNjdXNlcy10ZXNsYS1mYWxzZS1jbGFpbXMtYXV0b3BpbG90LWZ1bGwtc2VsZi1kcml2aW5nLWF1dG9ub21vdXMtdmVoaWNsZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,California DMV accuses Tesla of making false claims about Autopilot and Full-Self Driving,"California’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) has accused Tesla of falsely advertising its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) features as reported earlier by the Los Angeles Times (via CNBC). The agency filed two separate complaints with the state’s Office of Administrative Hearings on July 28th alleging Tesla made “untrue or misleading” claims about its vehicles’ autonomous driving capabilities.

In the filings the DMV claims the names of Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD features as well as the language the company uses to describe them wrongly imply that cars equipped with the technology can operate autonomously. The DMV specifically points to the information on Tesla’s Autopilot page which states its FSD system “is designed to be able to conduct short and long distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver’s seat” and is capable of “navigating urban streets complex intersections and freeways.”

“Vehicles equipped with those ADAS features could not at the time of those advertisements and cannot now operate as autonomous vehicles”

Tesla includes Autopilot in all of its vehicles which comes with features like traffic-aware cruise control and autosteer. Drivers have to pay $12000 extra for Tesla’s FSD system an option that adds auto-parking auto lane changing the ability for drivers to summon a vehicle from a parking space to where they’re standing and access to a beta program to test upcoming features. Tesla’s FSD and Autopilot don’t make vehicles fully autonomous though and still require drivers to pay attention to the road and keep their hands on the wheel at all times.

“Instead of simply identifying product or brand names these ‘Autopilot’ and ‘Full Self-Driving Capability’ labels and descriptions represent that vehicles equipped with the ADAS [advanced driver-assistance system] features will operate as an autonomous vehicle but vehicles equipped with those ADAS features could not at the time of those advertisements and cannot now operate as autonomous vehicles” the DMV claims in the filling. “These advertisements are a deceptive practice.”

Although Tesla already provides disclaimers about its driver-assist technology the DMV says it’s not enough to reverse its alleged misleading statements. The DMV’s action could result in the suspension of Tesla’s licenses to produce and sell cars in California but the agency may not go that far. In a statement to the Los Angeles Times a spokesperson for the agency said it would require Tesla to properly educate customers about its Autopilot and FSD features and provide sufficient warnings about the limitations of the technology. Tesla has 15 days to respond to the DMV’s complaint or the agency will take action without a hearing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3JvYWRzaG93L25ld3MvdGVzbGEtYWNjdXNlZC1vZi1mYWxzZWx5LWFkdmVydGlzaW5nLWF1dG9waWxvdC1hbmQtc2VsZi1kcml2aW5nLWZlYXR1cmVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Accused of Falsely Advertising Autopilot and Self-Driving Features,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.cnet.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Unique Tesla booking experience | EDIT: 2023 Tesla Model 3 Performance delivered Tesla Model 3 Performance- Booking Experience



Background



I have been keeping an eye out in the market to add a second car to our garage ever since I returned the Mazda CX-9 which served us very well. Due to the Pandemic it's mostly WFH we don’t really need a second car but for some

reason there was a strong urge since last few months to add an EV to the garage to complete an ICE + EV Garage Portfolio.



I love to drive and do long distances at the drop of a hat. As an example I have been averaging roughly about 2000 miles per month over the last 5 years (Including my rental car driving that constitutes about 20% of my total driving due to work related travel). During my stint in the east coast I used to travel almost twice in a month and would always rent a car when the distances were 800 miles or less.



When the thought came to add a second car multiple “type” of cars cycled through my mind starting from muscle cars (Challenger being my most favorite Mustang Camaro etc) rally bred cars (WRX STI GTI Focus RS etc) to trucks (fell in love with them when I drove a Dodge Ram).



After driving a BMW it’s hard to enjoy the above type of cars except maybe the rally bred cars as you are used to a certain luxury brand and smooth power delivery. I like to look forward in life and not backwards as some of the cars listed above would have been great choices maybe half a decade ago but not in this age.



With that said I decided to look forward which meant it has to be a fully electric vehicle and initially it was a no brainer to get a TESLA. But I was not too happy with its monopoly and absolute craze and fan following of Tesla owners worldwide.



I was hell-bent to find a competitor who are at least on par and if not similar driving experience as choosing what's popular or a herd mentality is not my style. I will commit to only something that blows my mind.



Thus started my journey and I was clear that it has to be a performance oriented EV and keep a strict budget of $60000 landing price. With that in mind I shortlisted the following and decided to test drive them in order.



Polestar 2

Kia EV6

Tesla Model Y Performance

Tesla Model 3 Performance



Over the last few months I test drove all of the above starting with Polestar 2 and Kia EV 6. While both cars are pretty good and there is hard to find fault in them but they just didn’t feel special or gave a “wow feeling when driven hard despite being powerful cars with 400HP and 325 HP versions.



Besides that they just didn’t feel worth the $60000-$70000 landing price. Well I briefly considered test driving a BMW i4 M50 but it starts at $75000 and knowing BMW by the time I build the car that I like it will be north of $90K which is simply out of my budget.



Polestar 2- Brief Test Drive Report



https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/elect...ml#post5309676 (Polestar 2: Volvo teases Tesla Model 3 rival)



Kia EV6 GT Line-Brief Test Drive Report



https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/elect...ml#post5317218 (Kia launches EV faster than Porsches Taycan 4S)



Well I reluctantly decided to reconsider TESLA.



It was a simple shortlist of choosing a Y or 3. As S and X models are over a hundred grand and is a dream for now. After the model shortlist next came the variant shortlist.



My single track mind focuses only on performance which unfortunately is the highest end variant costing a bomb.



The EV rebate is discontinued a couple of years ago after Tesla crossed 200000 units. Either-ways it is not applicable to their models that cost > $50000.



I almost decided to cancel the whole plan of buying an EV after getting to know the final landing price as it was ridiculously high.



a) Tesla Model Y which was my initial shortlist costs a whopping $85000 with all taxes and fees included in WA.



b) Tesla Model 3 Performance costs an equally eye-popping $75000 with all taxes and fees included in WA.



I was now in a quandary to move forward or completely pause. I decided to take it step-by-step as I was not in a rush to buy anything and decided to do some exhaustive test drive both models.



I started with their most popular (in the current market scenario) Model Y.



Here is the link to my test drive report of a YP that I kept overnight.



https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/elect...ml#post5361760 (Test Drive : A day with the 2022 Tesla Model Y Performance)



I was completely blown by the Tesla Model Y. During this process I reached out to BHPian Carthick1000 and we had one super long chat and kept in touch via. Text and he was very helpful and patiently answered all my questions that gave me confidence to look at Tesla seriously.



I also spoke to BHPian LexusES350 briefly and being a new owner he was floored with Tesla Model Y ownership experience and had nothing but positive things to say about his ownership.



Patience is not one of my virtues (lol !!) so within 2-3 of Test Drive of Model YP and speaking to Carthik1000 I went ahead and placed an order for Tesla Model 3 Performance.



Order was placed without even driving the performance model knowing confidently 2 things for sure :



1. Being a sedan It will drive better than a Model Y

2. I will save some dough as it will cost me $10000 less and we already have an SUV so sedan is an appropriate choice















Here is a quick process of “How to Order” a Tesla online.



This is probably the simplest & best experience of buying a car as there are no middle men and there is no haggling (If you ever bought auto in US you would know the car salesmen are the most notorious for fooling customers in paying a higher price)



With Tesla no such hassle. What you see is what you get !!!



Visit



It used to be bit complicated until 2022 with respect to the models on offer. Now they made it simple and Tesla Model 3 is offered in 3 different variants.











Here is a give break-down of the Tesla Model 3 variants on offer :



Tesla Model 3 (Rear Wheel Drive and Single Motor) which is the base model of Tesla and pumps out a healthy 275 horsepower which is claimed as Tesla does not quote horsepower figures. This is delivered through it’s 50KWH battery pack and does 0-60mph in quick 5.6 seconds and has a decent claimed range of 267 miles (420kms)



This starts at $41000 USD and is cheapest Tesla one can buy.



2. Tesla Model 3 (AWD and Dual Motor) is 2nd variant of Tesla Model 3 and probably the most popular as this is their “Long Range Model” and has a claimed range of an astonishing 334 miles (550kms) and does a 0-60 in a blistering 4.2 seconds has a 350 HP from its 75KWH battery pack . The is the highest selling model of Tesla Model 3 from these 3 variants.



This variant starts at $52000 USD



There is an interesting “Acceleration Boost” on offer by Tesla for a mere $2000 which can shave off the long range’s acceleration by 0.5 seconds to 3.7 seconds.



3. Tesla Model 3 Performance (AWD and Dual Motor) which is popularly known as M3P is their performance version and has a decent claimed range of 315 miles (500kms)



M3P 0-60mph is in supercar level at an eye-popping and brain squishing 3.1 seconds.



M3P differentiates itself from its siblings in the following manner



- ~ 500 HP

- Lowered Suspension tuned for performance

- 21” Ubertine Wheels

Powerful Brembo Brakes with Red Calipers

Carbon Fiber Spoiler



M3P starts at $57000 USD



For an additional 5 grand you get a slightly lower range but all the above performance goodies so it was a no-brainer for me to choose the M3P.



Next is to choose the exterior color. White and Black are standard option colors while the Metallic grey costs $1000 extra and Red costs an additional $2000.







I’m particular about colors. Certain colors are associated with a certain brand. BMW for me is always Blue Ferrari has to be Red Lamborghini started it’s journey with Yellow and similarly for me Tesla has to be Red (Despite its steep $2000 add-on price just for the color). Other OEM’s charge typically $500 for a color choice. Well It’s a Tesla and they call the shots.







At the next step you choose the interior color. Black is standard White comes at $1000 premium. I saw both colors and have never been a fan of black interiors as it gives me a gloomy feeling. Wish Tesla had more color choices but I settled for white which looks gorgeous and goes so well with red exteriors.



Once the above is completed next is to choose the autonomous packages which has been steadily increasing from $8000 to $12000. However majority of folks who order a Tesla do not order the Full Self Driving (FSD) as it can be also bought as a monthly subscription of $200/month which can be ordered and cancelled at anytime. It would be useful to get it during long highway trips and then cancel it within the month.



Final screen prompts to choose from 3 different options of purchasing the Tesla



Cash

Finance

Lease



I would have chosen lease if there was an option to buy it back at end of lease as that is best way to buy a vehicle in US as residual value (Negotiable) at the end of 3-years is already locked on Day 1.



However Tesla does not allow “Buy-Back” options of their cars at the end of a Lease period which is a strategic move by them as Tesla's are known to hold their value much higher than ICE vehicles. Many folks didn't know this and opted for lease falling for the lower monthly payments. It was a rude shock for them at the end of lease period when they decided to keep the car.



Thankfully I got to know about this as there is nowhere it explicitly mentions this and if you aren't careful then will end up with an expensive mistake. Hence I chose to finance the car.



Next step make a “non-refundable” payment of $250 ($1050 if you add the mobile charger and adapter to the order).



Voila!! Your Tesla order is placed. They keep sending you messages and we can check the Tesla App regularly to see the delivery date which unfortunately keeps changing as there is a huge waiting period for most Tesla’s.



Typical wait period of Long Range is 5-6 months which is what 90% of customers order and minority like us who order the performance model get their cars little bit sooner (2-3 months).



As you can see from below screenshots In last two weeks since I booked the car I have seen 3 different delivery dates.



Initially it was between August’22 to Sep’22.



With a few weeks it changed to November’22-December’22



Thankfully it recently got updated to Sep 11th-Oct 16th 2022 and keeping fingers crossed it should be delivered by end of September’2022.











Since I have lot of time on hand waiting for the M3P to arrive. I decided to test drive the car and it impressed me lot more than the Tesla Model Y and it gave me a satisfaction that my blind leap of faith was not entirely in the wrong direction. Here is the report of my M3P Test Drive experience.



https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/elect...ml#post5371857 (Test Drive : A day with the 2022 Tesla Model Y Performance)



I am excited and counting the days to start my EV journey with our new Tesla Model 3 Performance. I have been keeping an eye out in the market to add a second car to our garage ever since I returned the Mazda CX-9 which served us very well. Due to the Pandemic it's mostly WFH we don’t really need a second car but for somereason there was a strong urge since last few months to add an EV to the garage to complete anI love to drive and do long distances at the drop of a hat. As an example I have been averaging roughly about 2000 miles per month over the last 5 years (Including my rental car driving that constitutes about 20% of my total driving due to work related travel). During my stint in the east coast I used to travel almost twice in a month and would always rent a car when the distances were 800 miles or less.When the thought came to add a second car multiple “type” of cars cycled through my mind starting from muscle cars (Challenger being my most favorite Mustang Camaro etc) rally bred cars (WRX STI GTI Focus RS etc) to trucks (fell in love with them when I drove a Dodge Ram).After driving a BMW it’s hard to enjoy the above type of cars except maybe the rally bred cars as you are used to a certain luxury brand and smooth power delivery. I like to look forward in life and not backwards as some of the cars listed above would have been great choices maybe half a decade ago but not in this age.With that said I decided to look forward which meant it has to be a fully electric vehicle and initially it was a no brainer to get a TESLA. But I was not too happy with its monopoly and absolute craze and fan following of Tesla owners worldwide.I was hell-bent to find a competitor who are at least on par and if not similar driving experience as choosing what's popular or a herd mentality is not my style. I will commit to only something that blows my mind.Thus started my journey and I was clear that it has to be a performance oriented EV and keep a strict budget of $60000 landing price. With that in mind I shortlisted the following and decided to test drive them in order.Polestar 2Kia EV6Tesla Model Y PerformanceTesla Model 3 PerformanceOver the last few months I test drove all of the above starting with Polestar 2 and Kia EV 6. While both cars are pretty good and there is hard to find fault in them but they just didn’t feel special or gave a “wow feeling when driven hard despite being powerful cars with 400HP and 325 HP versions.Besides that they just didn’t feel worth the $60000-$70000 landing price. Well I briefly considered test driving a BMW i4 M50 but it starts at $75000 and knowing BMW by the time I build the car that I like it will be north of $90K which is simply out of my budget.Well I reluctantly decided to reconsider TESLA.It was a simple shortlist of choosing a Y or 3. As S and X models are over a hundred grand and is a dream for now. After the model shortlist next came the variant shortlist.My single track mind focuses only on performance which unfortunately is the highest end variant costing a bomb.The EV rebate is discontinued a couple of years ago after Tesla crossed 200000 units. Either-ways it is not applicable to their models that cost > $50000.I almost decided to cancel the whole plan of buying an EV after getting to know the final landing price as it was ridiculously high.a)which was my initial shortlist costs a whoppingwith all taxes and fees included in WA.b)costs an equally eye-poppingwith all taxes and fees included in WA.I was now in a quandary to move forward or completely pause. I decided to take it step-by-step as I was not in a rush to buy anything and decided to do some exhaustive test drive both models.I started with their most popular (in the current market scenario) Model Y.Here is the link to mythat I kept overnight.I was completely blown by the Tesla Model Y. During this process I reached out to BHPian Carthick1000 and we had one super long chat and kept in touch via. Text and he was very helpful and patiently answered all my questions that gave me confidence to look at Tesla seriously.I also spoke to BHPian LexusES350 briefly and being a new owner he was floored with Tesla Model Y ownership experience and had nothing but positive things to say about his ownership.Patience is not one of my virtues (lol !!) so within 2-3 of Test Drive of Model YP and speaking to Carthik1000 I went ahead and placed an order for Tesla Model 3 Performance.Order was placed without even driving the performance model knowing confidently 2 things for sure :1. Being a sedan It will drive better than a Model Y2. I will save some dough as it will cost me $10000 less and we already have an SUV so sedan is an appropriate choiceHere is a quick process ofa Tesla online.This is probably the simplest & best experience of buying a car as there are no middle men and there is no haggling (If you ever bought auto in US you would know the car salesmen are the most notorious for fooling customers in paying a higher price)With Tesla no such hassle. What you see is what you get !!!Visit www.tesla.com and choose the model and place an order by paying a order fee of $250.It used to be bit complicated until 2022 with respect to the models on offer. Now they made it simple and Tesla Model 3 is offered in 3 different variants.Here is a give break-down of the Tesla Model 3 variants on offer :Tesla Model 3 (Rear Wheel Drive and Single Motor) which is the base model of Tesla and pumps out a healthy 275 horsepower which is claimed as Tesla does not quote horsepower figures. This is delivered through it’s 50KWH battery pack and does 0-60mph in quick 5.6 seconds and has a decent claimed range of 267 miles (420kms)This starts atand is cheapest Tesla one can buy.2. Tesla Model 3 (AWD and Dual Motor) is 2nd variant of Tesla Model 3 and probably the most popular as this is their “Long Range Model” and has a claimed range of an astonishing 334 miles (550kms) and does a 0-60 in a blistering 4.2 seconds has a 350 HP from its 75KWH battery pack . The is the highest selling model of Tesla Model 3 from these 3 variants.This variant starts atThere is an interesting “Acceleration Boost” on offer by Tesla for a mere $2000 which can shave off the long range’s acceleration by 0.5 seconds to 3.7 seconds.3. Tesla Model 3 Performance (AWD and Dual Motor) which is popularly known as M3P is their performance version and has a decent claimed range of 315 miles (500kms)M3P 0-60mph is in supercar level at an eye-popping and brain squishing 3.1 seconds.M3P differentiates itself from its siblings in the following manner- ~ 500 HP- Lowered Suspension tuned for performance- 21” Ubertine WheelsPowerful Brembo Brakes with Red CalipersCarbon Fiber SpoilerM3P starts atFor an additional 5 grand you get a slightly lower range but all the above performance goodies so it was a no-brainer for me to choose the M3P.Next is to choose the exterior color. White and Black are standard option colors while the Metallic grey costs $1000 extra and Red costs an additional $2000.I’m particular about colors. Certain colors are associated with a certain brand. BMW for me is always Blue Ferrari has to be Red Lamborghini started it’s journey with Yellow and similarly for me Tesla has to be Red (Despite its steep $2000 add-on price just for the color). Other OEM’s charge typically $500 for a color choice. Well It’s a Tesla and they call the shots.At the next step you choose the interior color. Black is standard White comes at $1000 premium. I saw both colors and have never been a fan of black interiors as it gives me a gloomy feeling. Wish Tesla had more color choices but I settled for white which looks gorgeous and goes so well with red exteriors.Once the above is completed next is to choose the autonomous packages which has been steadily increasing from $8000 to $12000. However majority of folks who order a Tesla do not order the Full Self Driving (FSD) as it can be also bought as a monthly subscription of $200/month which can be ordered and cancelled at anytime. It would be useful to get it during long highway trips and then cancel it within the month.Final screen prompts to choose from 3 different options of purchasing the TeslaCashFinanceLeaseI would have chosen lease if there was an option to buy it back at end of lease as that is best way to buy a vehicle in US as residual value (Negotiable) at the end of 3-years is already locked on Day 1.However Tesla does not allow “Buy-Back” options of their cars at the end of a Lease period which is a strategic move by them as Tesla's are known to hold their value much higher than ICE vehicles. Many folks didn't know this and opted for lease falling for the lower monthly payments. It was a rude shock for them at the end of lease period when they decided to keep the car.Thankfully I got to know about this as there is nowhere it explicitly mentions this and if you aren't careful then will end up with an expensive mistake. Hence I chose to finance the car.Next step make a “non-refundable” payment of $250 ($1050 if you add the mobile charger and adapter to the order).Voila!! Your Tesla order is placed. They keep sending you messages and we can check the Tesla App regularly to see the delivery date which unfortunately keeps changing as there is a huge waiting period for most Tesla’s.Typical wait period of Long Range is 5-6 months which is what 90% of customers order and minority like us who order the performance model get their cars little bit sooner (2-3 months).As you can see from below screenshots In last two weeks since I booked the car I have seen 3 different delivery dates.Initially it was between August’22 to Sep’22.With a few weeks it changed to November’22-December’22Thankfully it recently got updated to Sep 11th-Oct 16th 2022 and keeping fingers crossed it should be delivered by end of September’2022.Since I have lot of time on hand waiting for the M3P to arrive. I decided to test drive the car and it impressed me lot more than the Tesla Model Y and it gave me a satisfaction that my blind leap of faith was not entirely in the wrong direction. Here is theI am excited and counting the days to start my EV journey with our new Tesla Model 3 Performance. Attached Thumbnails

By Kim Hyun-bin



Hyundai Motor Group is accelerating plans to develop its own automotive semiconductors spearheaded by auto parts affiliate Hyundai Mobis. The move is part of a strategy to cope with semiconductor supply shortage risks and strengthen competitiveness in future mobility as the internal production of semiconductors has become more important than ever amid the transition to electric vehicles (EV) according to industry officials Sunday.



Semiconductors have become a key determinant in the competitiveness of future cars because EVs and autonomous vehicles require more than 500 to 1000 semiconductors which is up to three times the amount used in internal combustion automobiles.



Hyundai Mobis said during a conference call announcing second quarter earnings held last month that it plans to develop and produce automotive semiconductors.



""We are focusing on power semiconductors and are in the process of developing and producing them. We also see system semiconductors as an area of development"" Hyundai Mobis said.



Behind Hyundai Motor Group's internalization of semiconductors is the global automotive market's rapid transition to future vehicles such as EVs and autonomous driving.



Power semiconductors developed and produced by Hyundai Mobis is one of the key components that can extend the driving range of EVs. High-performance semiconductors are necessary parts of autonomous driving and artificial intelligence (AI).



Around the end of 2020 Hyundai Mobis acquired the semiconductor division of Hyundai Autron a group affiliate. In March of last year it announced it was ""promoting the internalization of semiconductors.""



System semiconductors must be produced directly or consigned through a foundry and Hyundai Mobis is highly likely to opt for consignment production because it takes a lot of money and time to build a semiconductor factory.



Currently six companies including Renesas of Japan NXP of the Netherlands Infineon of Germany Texas Instruments and Microchip of the U.S. and ST Microelectronics of Switzerland supply 90 percent of the world's automotive system semiconductors.



Korean companies meanwhile account for only around 2 percent of the market. There have been very few new players in the sector as product cycles and warranty periods are long while profitability is lower than high-performance memory semiconductors.

Two-Buck Chuck. Simple Truth. Cat & Jack. Great Value. Amazon Basics. Store brands have never been more popular.

They have become forces in their own right and make up around 21% of sales in the $1.7 trillion US grocery industry according to IRI.

As prices surge store brands — also known as private labels white labels or generic brands — have become an even more attractive option for inflation-fatigued shoppers who are looking to switch from pricier name brands. Store brands can be anywhere from 10% to 50% cheaper.

But the origins of store brands remain largely secretive.

Retailers aren't typically forthcoming about the companies that make their brands. And manufacturers likewise have little incentive to reveal that they're creating similar products to their name brands under a different label sold on the cheap.

Many leading national brand manufacturers create private labels for multiple retailers. In the late 1990s more than half of brand manufacturers were estimated to make private goods as well.

Although store brands ostensibly compete with manufacturers' national brands manufacturers often have excess capacity on their production lines. To generate additional profit some will use that extra capacity to make private labels.

Other brand manufacturers will produce private labels as an incentive for retailers hoping they'll be rewarded with better shelf space and placement for their own national labels.

""Most manufacturers aren't open about it"" said Jan-Benedict E.M. Steenkamp a marketing professor at the University of North Carolina who studies private labels and branding. ""Manufacturers don't want it to be known because it undermines the power of their own brands.""

But there are some exceptions. Kimberly-Clark the maker of Huggies diapers produces Kirkland Signature diapers for Costco and Duracell produces Kirkland Signature batteries Costco executives have said.

Georgia-Pacific the maker of Brawny and Dixie also produces store brands. So does Henkel the manufacturer of Purex and Dial.

Eight O'Clock Coffee and Kenmore

Store labels have been around since the early days of retail and the emergence of consumer brands in the 19th century.

Macy's sold stoneware whiskey jugs under its own name. Customers could bring back the jugs for refills according to Christopher Durham the president of the Velocity Institute a trade association for private brands.

Montgomery Ward developed its own line of aspirin in wooden containers while the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. (aka A&P) sold branded spices with the slogan ""Take the Grandmother's Advice Use A&P Spices."" A&P later developed Eight O'Clock Coffee one of the most famous private labels of the period.

Yet no US retailer was more successful developing its own brands than Sears Roebuck.

In 1925 Sears created the Allstate brand for car tires. A few years later Sears launched its first Craftsman wrench according to Durham. Its Kenmore line which started as a sewing machine brand in 1913 before branching into vacuums and other home appliances became the leading home appliance brand in the United States.

These private labels were the exception however.

For most of the 20th century national brands such as Jell-O H.J. Heinz Campbell Soup and Johnson & Johnson had power over stores. These manufacturers flooded the airwaves and newspapers with advertisements extolling the advantages of their products.

Most customers were fiercely loyal to specific brands not retailers. A store that didn't carry major labels would likely get crushed which gave manufacturers immense leverage.

Additionally many store brands were also considered dull cheap knockoffs of national brands.

The low point of private label came during the 1970s Durham said when stores seeking to cut costs and rolled out generics with basic white backgrounds and black letters identifying the product -- beer soap cola beans and other staples.

Shopper loyalty

Retailers make private label brands for a variety of reasons including to boost profitability and sometimes as a negotiating tool against brands.

Private brands often carry profit margins that are 20% to 40% higher than national brands because stores don't have to pay the advertising distribution or other markup costs that are embedded in major brands' prices.

In the mid-20th century many retailers started to develop their own labels to claw back bargaining power from dominant suppliers and keep their prices in check. As the US retail industry has consolidated in recent decades the power dynamic between retailers and suppliers reversed. Now stores have more leverage to introduce their own labels -- whether name brands like it or not.

""Forty years ago Walmart pissing off P&G would be a risky situation. Now Walmart is much bigger than P&G"" said Steenkamp the marketing professor.

Today stores' private brand operations are more sophisticated than ever and a much bigger focus for chains.

Stores are likelier these days to develop a distinctive private brand or product to stand out against competitors and create shopper loyalty said Krishnakumar Davey the president of client engagement at IRI.

Costco for example will decide to make a Kirkland Signature product because a leading brand won't sell to the retailer. Or Costco believes the name brand's prices have gotten too high and it can make its own similar-quality product and sell it for 20% less.

Costco hasn't lost any relationships with suppliers by launching its own Kirkland products but those brands are not usually pleased when Costco introduces one company CFO Richard Galanti said in an interview earlier this year.

Retailers have been sued for creating products that too closely resemble national brands. The owner of golf ball-brand Titleist sued Costco for patent infringement while Williams-Sonoma sued Amazon for selling ""knockoffs"" under its own brand. Both cases were settled.

The US House Judiciary Committee and other lawmakers and regulators around the world have investigated whether Amazon uses data from sellers to create its own brands and unlawfully favors its own brands on its website.

Amazon has said it doesn't use the data from individual third-party sellers to inform the development of its own private brands and does not favor its own products on the site.

Most stores start small with their own brands. Grocers for example will often first introduce a shelf-stable product like pasta flour sugar or rice that's easier to make and where brand loyalty within the category isn't strong.

""You don't start with the most difficult things"" Steenkamp said. ""As stores build more experience and success then they enter new categories.""

How to find out who makes store brands

So how do you tell who's behind your favorite store brands?

Product recalls are often the most revealing way to find out which brand manufacturers are behind specific private labels.

Last year for example Dole recalled fresh salads and vegetables including private brands for Walmart Kroger and H-E-B.

J.M. Smucker recalled certain Jif peanut butter products this year as well as store-branded items it made for Giant Eagle Wawa and Safeway. Large companies such as Conagra and McCain Foods have recalled products from Trader Joe's.

Then there are the dedicated private label manufacturers such as Treehouse Foods which makes snacks under the labels of supermarkets big-box chains and other retailers. Nearly one-quarter of the company's $4.3 billion in sales last year for example came from Walmart.

James Walser who led the launch of Target's up & up household basics and personal care brand in 2009 said that Target tried to move away from national brand manufacturers during up & up's development to nimbler suppliers focused solely on making private labels.

Some large retailers also make their own private labels. Kroger for example makes about 30% of its own private products.

Perhaps the strangest store brand manufacturers are retailers that make private brands for their ... competitors: Safeway-owned Lucerne Foods manufactures private labels for Safeway's rivals.

Tyler was 30 years old a graduate of Dartmouth High School and Bridgewater State University when he took his own life in 2018.

His uncle Joel Baptista said Tyler's smile could light up a room but it was amazing how much that smile could hide.

""We saw some signs and help was provided but sometimes the pain is just too much and people can't see the light at the end of the tunnel"" Baptista said. ""We have a close-knit family but we just didn't know it would come to that.""

Jenelle Hickey is the coordinator of a program at Child and Family Services that assists young people at risk of suicide giving them the help they need to hopefully move forward.

Both Baptista and Hickey joined Townsquare Sunday this week to discuss suicide in our area.

After Tyler's death Baptista said his family decided to form a foundation to assist organizations working with young people on suicide prevention. That organization is Child and Family Services and Janelle Hickey's CBAT unit.

""We work with kids (ages) four to 17 who are in an acute mental health crisis"" Hickey said. ""That might mean depression anxiety or having suicidal thoughts and feelings.""

She said youngsters in the program stay about two weeks while personnel work on getting them to feel better.

CBAT currently has nine beds but it will grow to 15 when the program moves to the former Regal House building on Church Street sometime after the New Year. Hickey said her program is always full and sadly it's not uncommon for people at risk to have to wait for placement.

The Tyler Joseph Leonard Memorial Foundation will hold a fundraiser on September 10 from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. at the Allendale Country Club in Dartmouth. It will feature music dancing a silent auction and much more.

Proceeds from the event will fund a scholarship for a Dartmouth High School student and the CBAT program at Child and Family Services. For information and tickets visit thetylerjosephleonardmemorialfoundation.org.

The village was founded by William Mills and approximately 100 families who were followers of Robert Owen who wanted to emulate the utopian community. Visit HISTORY to learn more about Yellow Spring.





This is thought to be the original “Yellow Spring” in Glen Helen Nature Preserve.

Glen Helen is a 1125 acre forest and nature preserve just east of downtown Yellow Springs. The preserve offers miles of trails springs waterfalls limestone cliffs wooded areas miles of trails with springs waterfalls and limestone cliffs.

Now the largest and most visited private nature preserve in the Miami Valley Glen Helen was donated by Antioch College Alumnus Hugh Taylor Birch in 1929. Birch named the Glen in memory of his daughter Helen.... Glen Helen.

An interesting place to visit while there is The Raptor Center. Since Glen Helen is a nonprofit organization generously supported by donations the Raptor Center does have a wish list which includes:

Nearly 200 townhomes were once proposed for 28 acres near the intersection of S.C. 9 and S.C. 57 a busy crossroads not far from Little River that is dotted with everything from national retailers restaurants and car dealerships that is still expanding.

But after multiple denials by County Council the developer of the failed project plans to resurrect it but in a different form after meeting with county staff.

Applicant Thomas & Hutton went before the Horry County Planning Commission on August 4 to request a third rezoning of the property to allow for the construction of 74 single-family homes with lots of 7000 square feet each. During the meeting the developer agreed to close off a proposed entrance on Calvary Road after concerns from nearby residents.

Planning commissioners approved the latest proposal but they only give recommendations so County Council will once again have the final say if the proposed development is ultimately built.

The proposed 182 multi-family development was voted down at a June 21 Horry County Council meeting after a council member voiced his concerns that traffic at the intersection had “gotten way out of hand.”

“I’ve given a lot a thought and any time I vote against a project” Councilman Mark Causey said at the June meeting. It’s a really hard thing for me to do because I understand the property rights and everything involved in this. But given the circumstances with traffic in that area now I just cannot support this at this time.”

The June denial was the latest hurdle for the project after a similar plan failed in December when engineering firm Thomas & Hutton’s request to build 125 townhomes on 18 acres was also unanimously rejected by County Council members who agreed with the Horry County Planning Commission’s earlier recommendation that the proposed project not move forward.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZW50ZXJwcmlzZXJzcHJvamVjdC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIyLzgvNy1za2lsbHMtY2lvcy1zYXktYXJlLWNvcmUtdGhlaXItam9ic9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 skills CIOs say are core to their jobs,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZW50ZXJwcmlzZXJzcHJvamVjdC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIyLzgvNy1za2lsbHMtY2lvcy1zYXktYXJlLWNvcmUtdGhlaXItam9ic9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D81C89FF0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZW50ZXJwcmlzZXJzcHJvamVjdC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIyLzgvNy1za2lsbHMtY2lvcy1zYXktYXJlLWNvcmUtdGhlaXItam9ic9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1saXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Fubi1hcmJvci8yMDIyLzA4L3dlZWQtcnVzaC1ob3ctc2FsaW5lLWlzLWhhbmRsaW5nLWFuLWluZmx1eC1vZi1tYXJpanVhbmEtYnVzaW5lc3MtcHJvcG9zYWxzLmh0bWzSAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWxpdmUuY29tL25ld3MvYW5uLWFyYm9yLzIwMjIvMDgvd2VlZC1ydXNoLWhvdy1zYWxpbmUtaXMtaGFuZGxpbmctYW4taW5mbHV4LW9mLW1hcmlqdWFuYS1idXNpbmVzcy1wcm9wb3NhbHMuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Weed rush: How Saline is handling an influx of marijuana business proposals,"SALINE MI — Ever since giving the OK to recreational marijuana the city of Saline has experienced a rush of interest from retailers.

In fact city offices have been “inundated” with applications according to Council Member Jim Dell’Orco.

Officials even decided to temporarily halt accepting new applications while they smoothed out some wrinkles in the process ultimately voting to increase the original 250-foot buffer between dispensaries to 1000 feet.

“I think that was maybe the one deficiency that existed in the initial ordinance” Saline Mayor Brian Marl said. “Our fear is that we were going to be oversaturated with marijuana dispensaries in the city of Saline.”

There are currently six proposed marijuana locations: the former Mickey’s Dairy Twist at 751 West Michigan Ave. Come Dancing at 465 E. Michigan Ave. Zax Auto Wash at 660 E. Michigan Ave Octapharma Plasma at 813 W. Michigan Ave. 7608 E. Michigan Ave. near Tractor Supply Co. and Lot20A which is the business park parcel next to Zippy Auto Wash.

“I knew there would be a lot of interest because the players in this business are a cash operation ... They have a lot of money to play with” Dell’Orco said.

The road to the weed rush

Saline first voted to allow medical marijuana in June 2021. Then in March 2022 city council voted to allow recreational marijuana businesses in the city.

Saline decided to not set a cap for marijuana permits but to instead restrict businesses to specific zoning districts in commercial areas outside downtown and use buffers to limit the number of retailers. This made it even more alluring to prospective businesses.

Shaun Mansour attorney and owner of Rush Cannabis -- one of the dispensaries making a play for Saline -- said one thing that made the city “attractive” was this lack of a cap.

“I commend Saline for creating an ordinance ... that essentially restricts the number of locations by zoning them out” Mansour said. “There’s a number of municipalities that do a ranking system or a point system and that almost always causes lawsuits because it’s arbitrary.”

Dell’Orco said there were a few different reasons behind allowing recreational retailers within the city besides giving voters what they want and generating tax revenue.

One of the important reasons for Dell’Orco involved maintaining control over how marijuana is regulated within the city instead of allowing others a chance to control it.

“Essentially the folks that want to set up these businesses with their lobby and their people would be in the driver’s seat” he said. “If they got their own proposals on the ballot and the voters approved it -- the city would lose a great deal of control over the zoning and the licensing and regulation of these businesses if we were not to opt in to get in front of it.”

Not only that but Dell’Orco said the city also anticipated retailers would redevelop vacant properties or older buildings that could use renovations -- however some applicants have shown that is not necessarily the case.

“To some extent that’s happened but what we’re finding in the application process is they either want to buy entirely vacant land and build from the ground up or they want to buy out existing businesses” Dell’Orco said.

Mickey’s Dairy Twist

One major location that highlighted this was Mickey’s Dairy Twist. There was a community backlash when residents learned the beloved local ice cream shop was poised to become the city’s first dispensary.

Rush Cannabis is expected to fill the former location of longtime Saline ice cream shop following final site plan approval.

Mansour said he has seen dispensaries redevelop old buildings that other retailers wouldn’t think to touch. He said Mickey’s Dairy Twist is an example of a building that can use a transformation.

The dispensary has one other location in Hazel Park that opened in April. Mansour said Rush Cannabis aims to open its Saline location by Thanksgiving and be the first dispensary in town.

Future of marijuana in Saline

Saline City Council Member Kevin Camero-Sulak isn’t surprised by the number of applications the city is receiving.

“We have seemingly an abundance of applications ... but it doesn’t mean that all of them are going to be approved or that there are locations that they can lease or build” he said.

Despite the number of applications Marl isn’t worried that the city will be overrun with marijuana or that all the dispensaries will last. He predicts two to three -- possibly four -- dispensaries will end up within the city.

“I do think in this particular situation the market will eventually correct itself if and if being the key word we become oversaturated with dispensaries in Saline” he said.

As marijuana continues to develop in Saline Marl looks to surrounding areas like Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti and realizes recreational marijuana retailers can work. He encourages the city’s residents to reach out with questions and concerns.

“Just look around in Washtenaw County” he said. “We have innumerable examples of good attractive stable communities who have committed these types of industries and it hasn’t ... detracted from the quality of life of their particular communities.”

Bonnie and Livingston Paulk founded the business in Union Springs AL in 1918. After 104 years the business continues to thrive and expand. “They founded the company with 2 pounds of cabbage seeds and $50 in their pocket” Sutterer says. At the time the Paulks were growing in their backyard but their mission was to bring the same quality harvest to home gardeners. Bonnie Plants continues to follow the Paulks’ mission in bringing high-quality fruits vegetables herbs and flowers to consumers across the country.

In the 1970s Bonnie Plants was purchased by the Alabama Farmers Cooperative keeping the company deeply tied to its roots. In 2016 The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company bought a minority interest in Bonnie. Five years later Bonnie Plants became a 50/50 joint venture between ScottsMiracle-Gro and the Alabama Farmers Cooperative.

“We have the history heritage and agricultural grounding from the Alabama Farmers Cooperative. They’ve been part of Bonnie for 50 years. Then you combine that with the wonderful marketing research and brand-building that ScottsMiracle-Gro brings and that’s a match made in heaven” Sutterer says. “It provides us with the support that we need on both sides to be the best we can be as a company. It’s the ideal structure for us. It only took us 100 years to get there but I’m glad we’re there now.”

Focus on Consumers

At Bonnie there is a major focus on the end consumer. To carry on the Paulks’ mission to bring a quality product to everyday gardeners Bonnie Plants invests heavily in consumer research to understand their preferences and pain points.

“Our research and development (R&D) team are second to none” Sutterer says.

The R&D team screens hundreds of varieties every year. This year the team is screening more than 1400 varieties. However they are not screening for things like how well the variety does during production in the greenhouse. Instead the team screens for in-garden performance. This includes the size of the yield and unique flavors textures colors and shapes.

“That manifests itself in product lines like the Bonnie Reserve collection which are small-batch unique genetics that you can’t get anywhere else” Sutterer says.

Bonnie also brings unique genetics to its customers through partnerships. The company partnered with breeder “Smokin’” Ed Currie who is known for breeding the world’s hottest pepper the Carolina Reaper.

“There’s a subculture called pepperheads. It’s a community of people who go crazy over the hottest peppers they can get their hands on” Sutterer says. “Smokin’ Ed’s mission is to develop a hotter pepper. We worked with him to develop an exclusive line of his special collection the Smokin’ Ed Collection of these super-hot peppers. We launched our first one of those two years ago. Within 24 hours they all sold out and we had thousands of people on a waiting list.”

This niche of small batch offerings has struck a chord with consumers especially those under 40 who are looking for something new and different.

Various retailers including Lowe’s Home Depot and Walmart also carry exclusive genetic product lines from Bonnie Plants which bring unique flavors textures colors and shapes to the mass market.

Bonnie’s R&D team also partners with larger breeders such as Ball Horticultural and Dümmen Orange. Sutterer says Bonnie works upstream with the larger breeders and evaluates the varieties before they are named. Bonnie also works with universities such as the University of Florida and smaller breeders.

“It would be easy for a company of our size to say we don’t deal with breeders on a small scale. But you can find innovation anywhere and that’s our focus” Sutterer says. “We build relationships and use their expertise in breeding.”

Expanding into New Markets

Sutterer says Bonnie’s vision is to be the No. 1 live goods company in the U.S. Its heritage is in vegetables and herbs but the Bonnie team sees opportunities beyond that in flowers succulents houseplants and packet seeds.

Bonnie offers a quarterly plant subscription service in partnership with ScottsMiracle-Gro called Knock! Knock! on JustKnockKnock.comhttp://JustKnockKnock.com. The consumer receives a curated mix of annuals in a proprietary patented “plant pie” on their doorstep. The gardener takes the mix out of the box and easily plants it in a pot with minimal time and effort. The mix is customized for the consumer’s region and the time of year. For example in the winter subscribers living in the northern U.S. would receive holiday greenery. Consumers say the process is easy such as baking a cake from a mix in a box.

“Gardeners don’t want to spend eight hours on a Saturday afternoon weeding and breaking up the soil and figuring out how to feed and water things” Sutterer says. “We took all of that out of the equation. We selected plants that grow well together. You just drop it in the pot.”

Bonnie Plants has another initiative in partnership with ScottsMiracle-Gro called Greendigs which offers indoor plants including houseplants succulents and herbs through the lens of home décor. These offerings cannot be found at a garden center Sutterer says. They are available at ShopGreendigs.com.

“This is another platform that has huge potential as plants become more of the fabric of your home décor” he says. “COVID-19 opened that door for a lot of people. Their home became a lot more than where they hung out on the weekends. It became an office and it became a school.”

Associates are Key to Overcoming Business Challenges

Bonnie Plants faces the same issues as other growers such as supply chain labor and transportation challenges says Senior Vice President of Supply Chain Fernando Quiros. He and his team prioritize face-to-face visits with each of the growing stations across the country to collaborate with Bonnie associates.

“It’s worth it” Quiros says. “Talking to the station managers and our sales team the growers the people doing value-added work and understanding challenges and listening to them. We couldn’t do it without their feedback.”

Quiros says Bonnie Plants believes in the power of technology to improve efficiency. For example the company is implementing new software that tracks on-site inventory and store deliveries to provide better insights to its retailers. Quiros and his team work with a focus group of eight station managers to give feedback on the software.

“They are helping us to make sure we understand their realities” Quiros says. “For all the things we think about doing that are new technology innovations they tell us if they are designed well and designed for the real world.” This culture is a key differentiator for Bonnie in the live-goods industry.

“We have the most dedicated group of associates in the industry” Quiros says.

One example of the Bonnie difference is when there was a historic freeze in Texas in 2021 a call-to-arms email went out and immediately more than two dozen Bonnie associates from across the country responded to drive to Texas and help deliver plants to get back in business. Many associates helped deliver plants again this spring in the northeast where there was a compressed season due to weather.

Enhancing Lives Through the Power of Plants

Sutterer says when he thinks about success he thinks about the impact that Bonnie Plants has made on communities across the country and its own employees since 1918. From the very beginning the Paulk family set aside acreage to grow and donate food to those experiencing hunger and food insecurity in their community.

Bonnie Plants continues to work to alleviate food insecurity by partnering with AmpleHarvest.org a free nationwide registry that connects home gardeners with local food pantries in their area. This partnership enables Bonnie to engage gardening consumers and bridge the gap between the home-grown harvest surplus and the need at local food pantries.

“This is the time of year when home gardeners come to their neighbors with their excess harvest and you start to not look your neighbor in the eye because you’re worried they’re going to have another bag of zucchini” Sutterer says. “Food pantries are crying for fresh vegetables. People who are hungry want fresh and nutritious vegetables. One of the most efficient ways to get them there is home gardeners.”

Bonnie has connected more than 10 million children to the joys and wonders of gardening through the Third Grade Cabbage Program since 1996.

“When the children realize that their food does not originate at the grocery store it’s a powerful moment in their lives” Sutterer says.

Schools and educators can register for the free program at bonniecabbageprogram.com.

In 2021 Bonnie formed the nonprofit 501(c)(3) Bonnie Plants Foundation. The vision of this new philanthropic arm of Bonnie Plants is to amplify and expand how the company is helping communities and associates thrive and grow healthy together through the power of plants.

The Bonnie Plants Foundation made its first major gift in 2022 to create a Children’s Garden inside the 16-acre Transformation Garden at Auburn University. The Children’s Garden will be open to the public exposing children and families to gardening through hands-on classroom teachings.

Additionally the Foundation established an Associate Hardship Fund to provide confidential help to Bonnie associates and their families in times of need — medical emergencies illnesses and disasters. Giving back to the community is sown into the culture at Bonnie Plants.

“Twenty years from now I’ll be gone the products will fade the financial statements will fade but those impacts are going to live on” Sutterer says. “When I think about success stories for Bonnie those points where we really are enhancing people’s lives through the power of plants those are the most powerful and enduring success stories.”

University Feeds Talent Pipeline

Sutterer says Bonnie Plants recently moved its corporate headquarters from Union Springs AL to Opelika AL for a close partnership with Auburn University. Auburn has strong programs in horticulture business and supply chain.

Bonnie funds annual scholarships with Auburn University’s Harbert College of Business and College of Agriculture supports the University’s Center for Supply Chain Innovation and recruits interns and full-time positions at the new Opelika headquarters.

“Through our relationship with Auburn we’ve brought in bright passionate business and horticulture leaders — from growers to supply chain and logistics business analytics and e-commerce — who have thrived in their careers at Bonnie” Sutterer says. “This relationship with Auburn along with our deep-rooted culture and our new headquarters building allows us to offer graduating students a great place to work in a location they love.”

The family culture at Bonnie Plants is a major factor in employee recruitment and retention.

“As our company has grown over generations and into new business areas and locations our core values have remained the same. These core values have helped us stay true to ourselves and our founding. People like to be part of an organization that gives back and matches their values.”"

He had been thinking about a trip to the Napa Valley. Instead he decided to make the drive from Syracuse and visit Niagara Falls.

He simply wasn't ready to fly and with fears growing that the economy is slowing he felt better doing something more affordable.

""I don't think of it like a vacation. It's like a getaway"" he said. ""But I needed a getaway.""

Wei is typical of the tourists visiting Niagara Falls this year.

Overall the local tourism industry is faring better this year than it did last year but business is still a far cry from pre-pandemic levels.

What's missing are the international tourists still wary of taking long trips with Covid lingering and border regulations often daunting.

And though Americans in nearby states have stepped up their visits – the two visitors aren't created equal. Local tourists tend to be more frugal than international ones – who tend to spend as much as three times more according to Visit Buffalo Niagara.

The good news is that for domestic tourists Niagara Falls is a no-brainer post-Covid vacation. Not only is it drivable for large populations making it less hassle and expense than a trip requiring a flight it takes place outdoors in wide-open spaces – where social distancing comes naturally.

Still there are forces challenging domestic travel to Niagara Falls. For one the ArriveCan app is scaring some tourists away from the Canadian border – prompting them to scrap plans for the Falls altogether. And high gas prices are hampering road trips.

At first glance it seems the difficulty crossing may mean more tourists stay stateside rather than leaving to spend money in Canada.

But in reality it can mean fewer tourists head to the Falls at all.

""We don't know how many of those people have just said 'This year with all that mumbo jumbo with the ArriveCan app and whatnot you know I hear the Jersey Shore is nice.' Or ""You know what why don't we go to Nags Head N.C.? Just someplace that doesn't have border-crossing issues'"" said John Kinney president of Whirlpool Jetboat Tours.

In other words Ontario's problems are New York's problems.

""A robust Canadian tourism economy is good for the U.S. side"" Kinney said.

Officials from Destination Niagara USA Niagara Falls' tourism bureau believe the Falls is reaping the rewards of its strategic advertising campaigns the past two years first reminding travelers that it was ""Open for business"" in 2020 and then touting its ""wide open spaces"" last year.

""We're on everyone's bucket list and we're affordable"" said John Percy president and CEO of Destination Niagara USA. ""The population within eight hours by motor vehicle is in the millions. And I think we've targeted that population very strategically.""

Hotels are a bright spot. Hotel room demand rose 12% over last year with supply remaining steady. That equated to higher occupancy higher average daily rate and higher revenue per available room. Revenue numbers last year were already above pre-pandemic levels. The average daily rate in June was $151 up 9% from last year. Occupancy rates were 75% but beat the national average which was 70%.

""We really just sometimes go against that national norm that people may not be doing so well"" Percy said. ""I think because we're so leisure-based and we are accessible by so much population. We're affordable accessible drivable – all of those point positively in our direction.""

It's not the first time the Niagara region has fared better than others.

""Even when there were economic downturns or the 9/11 crisis you know we still fared better than most"" Percy said. ""I was hoping this would come true here during Covid and during this crisis we have fared better than many destinations.""

But international travel still hasn't recovered.

India is Niagara's No. 1 visiting country followed by China and Korea. Those travelers have begun to return but not to their usual extent and they're not expected to return to their pre-Covid numbers until late 2023 and 2024 Percy said.

""Once you're put into quarantine and get into a domestic pattern it takes time to shake yourself from that"" he said.

And it will take time for the convention and business meetings markets to open back up.

""Companies got very excited about their bottom lines not spending that business dollar on business travel"" he said.

For families high gas prices are throwing a wrench into the bottom line. A road trip to the falls may be cheaper than a flight to Disney but it's still more expensive than it has been in years past.

And it's not just the gas needed to travel. It is making some excursions pricier too. The Whirlpool Jets for example were forced to add a 6% gas surcharge to each trip to help defray its doubled fuel costs.

And with inflation higher than it has been in 40 years tourists have to plan their meals souvenirs and excursions more carefully.

Buffalo Niagara's reasonable prices make it attractive at times like these said Michele Gutierrez of Detroit who considered trips to New York City and Toronto before settling on the Falls.

""Around here prices are not bad"" she said.

Those budget-conscious consumers have been a boon for Niagara Falls Adventures a tour company in Niagara Falls which focuses on being affordable and easy.

""I'm busier than I've ever been"" said Nick Hurd the company's CEO.

""I think the same people that are worried about gas prices they're looking for an affordable option"" said Hurd.

Another worry among domestic travelers is what's necessary to cross the border into Canada. Requirements got tighter during Covid – at various times requiring negative Covid tests and other documentation.

Several Canadian mayors along the border have spoken out against the ArriveCan requirement saying it is a barrier to those seeking to travel to Canada.

Canada requires visitors to fill out the ArriveCan app before entering the country which includes photographing travel documents and proof of vaccination. Some senior citizens have complained that they do not have the digital technology skills to complete the app or the smartphone to carry it.

Niagara Falls Adventures just launched a website that's a one-stop shop for things to do on the American side of the Falls.

""It's not touching anything that's Niagara Falls Canada. And the main reason is we want people to know if they're coming to our website they don't have to worry about whether they have a passport or have to be vaccinated all the back-end stuff. Just come to our site and anything that you could purchase on there is going to be on the U.S. side.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRyYXZlbC5jb20vY2hpY2Fnby1jaXR5cGFzcy12cy1jaGljYWdvLWNpdHktZ28tcGFzcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chicago CityPass & Go City Chicago Pass: What's The Difference?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRyYXZlbC5jb20vY2hpY2Fnby1jaXR5cGFzcy12cy1jaGljYWdvLWNpdHktZ28tcGFzcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzA2L2FpcmxpbmVzLWNhbmNlbC10aG91c2FuZHMtb2YtZmxpZ2h0cy1hcy1zdG9ybS1ncm91bmRzLXVzLXRyYXZlbGVycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airlines cancel thousands of flights as storm grounds US travelers,"Tens of thousands of flyers had their travel plans upended Friday after airlines canceled about 1400 U.S. flights as thunderstorms hit the East Coast.

Another 6300 flights had been delayed by early evening adding more chaos into those weekend travel plans according to tracking service FlightAware.

It was the second straight day of major disruptions and the worst day for cancellations since mid-June.

The three major airports in the New York City area and Reagan National Airport outside Washington D.C. recorded the most cancellations.

American Airlines scrubbed about 250 flights or 7% of its schedule. Republic Airways which operates smaller planes for American Eagle Delta Connection and United Express canceled a similar number about 25% of its flights.

Thunderstorms were stopping or delaying early-evening flights in New York Boston the Washington D.C. area Philadelphia Baltimore and Denver according to the Federal Aviation Administration.

About 1200 U.S. flights were canceled Thursday 4.6% of all those scheduled.

Travelers have been hit with widespread cancellations and delays this summer. Travel bounced back faster than expected — to about 88% of pre-pandemic levels in July — and airlines weren’t able to increase staffing fast enough. They have been cutting back on schedules in an attempt to make remaining flights more reliable.

Airlines flying in the U.S. had a bad June canceling more than 21000 flights or 2.7% up from 1.8% in June 2019 before airlines pushed workers to quit during the pandemic. The airlines did better in July however canceling about 14000 flights or 1.8%.

Wood Properties,"Wilson Creative Group

Special to Naples Daily News

John R. Wood Properties today announced merger agreements with two vacation rental companies Ft. Myers-based Resort Harbour Properties and Naples-based The Holiday Life. In April the company also acquired a Pine Island-based vacation rental company.

“Continued expansion of our presence in the high-end vacation rental market is a natural strategic evolution for John R. Wood Properties in our local area. These companies share our core values of legendary service and a respected code of ethics. Incorporating them into the John R. Wood Properties family will help agents realize a larger selection of listings for our clients while helping preserve our number-one market share in the Lee and Collier County market and it’s a goal we have pursued for several years” said Corey McCloskey John R. Wood Properties Vice President of Operations.

The three new entities will now be recognized as divisions of JRW Vacation Rentals LLC A John R. Wood Company.

“Affiliating with a larger real estate company such as John R. Wood Properties will enable each of these rental businesses to have access to more potential landlords and renters from the 700 John R. Wood agents” said McCloskey.

Resort Harbour Properties specializes in the condominiums at Sanibel Harbour Resort and nearby Punta Rassa. Owner Angelo Celmo has joined John R. Wood Properties as a broker associate; Sanibel Harbour rental operations will continue to be led by Kelly Dickens. The Resort offers short term rentals with fabulous waterfront views. Celmo formed the company in 2007.

The Holiday Life is a Naples-based vacation rental business owned by Casey Potter and Lisa Potter. The company has quickly grown among Collier County’s thriving luxury vacation rental market. Led by Casey The Holiday Life has accumulated approximately 100 high-end rental listings with some Naples luxury homes going for upwards of $100000 per month in season. The Potters formed the company in 2013.

Pine Island Realty has been in business since 1980 and formed the rental operation about two years ago. It is now called Pine Island Vacation Rentals and is led by Kelly Cruz. The Pine Island market is a popular destination for fishermen who want a crack at the fabulous fishing in the Pine Island/Boca Grande area. The company also has a number of family renters looking to get away from the stress of their normal lifestyle.

“Luxury vacation rentals have seen significant gains during the last year as travelers enthusiastically embrace these forms of accommodation” said McCloskey. “However shifts in consumer expectations place a premium on factors like rate transparency cancellation policies and as always customer service. Particularly in the luxury sector travelers expect the same effortlessness and reliability from vacation rentals that they have traditionally found in other forms of travel. The companies that will be successful are those that are already adapting to these changes.”

To maximize the ease of reserving vacation rentals all 3 divisions use popular websites such as VRBO and AirBnB. These allow customers to search for specific dates prices types of properties and other amenties so they can find their ideal vacation property.

In 2021 John R. Wood Properties surpassed all southwest Florida residential real estate brokerages in sales volume listings sold and total closed transaction sides based on information from the Naples Area Board of REALTORS® MLS for closings 1/1/2021 through 12/31/2021. Led by President and CEO Phil Wood recently recognized among Florida’s most influential business leaders by Florida Trend magazine the firm reported a record-setting written sales volume of $5.834 billion while also leading the Collier and Lee County market with 3054 listings sold and 6109 transaction sides."

In an IronPros Deep Dive into construction software interoperability we use new integrations announced by Kojo and Fleetio as examples of how integrations work and how contractors can better understand them as they evaluate and select construction software.

Construction Integrations Grow Over Time

Integrations are not static. They develop and change and contractors should do due diligence on each integration and the vendor's integration strategy. A case in point is Kojo a leading provider of procurement management software for construction contractors which has built tight integrations with enterprise resource planning (ERP) software products used in construction.

Integrations with Trimble Viewpoint Vista and Trimble Viewpoint Spectrum drive purchase order data into these systems of record to eliminate duplicate entry.

Spectrum drive purchase order data into these systems of record to eliminate duplicate entry. The Sage 100 Contractor and Sage 300 CRE integrations synchronize vendor job phase code job cost category tax code general ledger code and purchase order/commitment fields.

Kojo’s integration with QuickBooks Desktop updates QuickBooks vendor job item class and purchase order fields while the integration with Quickbooks Online updates vendor customer item tax code and purchase order fields.

Within Procore Kojo’s integration updates project vendor cost type cost code commitment and schedule of values fields.

Kojo’s integration with ComputerEase synchs with the job phase category tax code vendor and purchase order fields in ComputerEase.

Within Coins a Kojo integration writes to the vendor job cost code tax rate and purchase order fields.

In July of 2022 Kojo announced an initial integration with Autodesk Construction Cloud. In a briefing with Kojo CEO Maria Davison IronPros learned that this integration is a different beast from the company’s existing integrations with purchasing.

“Using this integration mutual customers of Kojo and Autodesk can add a partner card into their Autodesk Construction Cloud dashboard” Davison said. “What this means is that they will be able to access their Kojo environment directly from Autodesk. In other words the Partner Card acts as an embedded experience straight from their Autodesk Build Insight or BIM360 Project Home Dashboard. Because the construction management process is so fragmented and disjointed there is a huge risk of mistakes and miscommunications between teams. What integrating with Autodesk Construction Cloud is enabling customers to do is access their procurement and materials insight right from their main construction management platform.”

One way to think about the difference between Kojo’s Autodesk integration and their existing integrations is to see the Autodesk integration as a window to let you see from one system to the other whereas their other integrations are a door data can pass though. And it is not uncommon in the sector to see two entities standing small with integrations—StructionSite launched a similar integration for bidirectional visibility with Latium’s Job Site Insights Smart Construction platform.

According to Ryvit Vice President of Business Development Greg Mattes this is par for the course.

“An integration can start very simple” Mattes said. “Sometimes it is just a connection between one system and another system. In the construction space you have for instance an integration between Procore and an ERP and accounting product like Viewpoint Vista. Sometimes it can be moving a single field between those two systems. But these really simple integration profiles can provide some amount of automation for a shared business process.”

And getting to that rudimentary point still requires a good deal of planning because the two software products require a shared framework and permissions to access data in the other.

“Even before moving that one field there is the matter of establishing some sort of connection” Mattes said. “That enables one system to communicate with another system and understand what credentials need to be used.”

It would depend on the use case. Maybe there is a use case where I would want to be able to see what is happening in this system so I can do double entry in this other system. It makes these tasks simpler. Real value is true interoperability.”

One example of an integration enabling deep interoperability may be when a human resources software product is integrated with a construction ERP or accounting product to enable a contractor to move employee data the HR package to ERP where it is used for payroll and tracking employees their credentials and how they are assigned to specific projects or job tickets.

A next step would be a bidirectional integration that pulls payroll data back into the HR package so employees can see their pay stubs without logging into the ERP software.

Determining exactly how deep an integration between two software products in fact can be tricky.

“There are some challenges around the terminology around integration Mattes said. “Some people use terms like connections or integration or automation. I think when they start using terms like automated data flow that perks my ears up. Data is moving between one system and another and vice versa. That is true system integration and true interoperability

Mattes suggests contractors ask vendors touting integrations first of all whether the integration amounts to a simple interface or whether data is flowing in a unidirectional fashion or bidirectionally. Also it can be important to determine what data is being moved including:

Employee

Budget

Submittals

RFIs

Cost

Safety

Equipment

See Procore interface

Change Orders

Potential Change Orders

Also important is ensuring that the integration does not require manual processes to upload data and whether it happens in real time or near-real time or is a periodic batch update.

TAKEAWAY: The lesson here is that integrations between software products are not one-and-done events. They are like relationships that unfold and grow over time based on customer demand and mutual investments and knowing where two vendors are in their relationship towards deeper integration will be critical in contractors selecting software for interoperability.

Construction Software Facilitates Finance

Just as Kojo exposes supplier information to support the purchasing function modern estimating software will often be pre-integrated with materials and product databases that populate and roll it up into the total project cost. The integration itself drives value but much of the value is the result of the work put in by software vendor personnel and vendors that populate and share pricing data that in turn helps contractors specify their products and then include their products in projects. Estimating software serves as a distribution channel for materials and components and this business model is coming to other back-office functions. Many of these use cases focus on finance and lending including gap finance to make up for slow application for payment project finance small business lending and even legal services to help with collection efforts.

Finance support can come in the form of interoperability with external fintech companies’ transactional systems. In the case of software products from a number of companies a credit card can be linked directly to the accounts payable functionality in software to help capture and automatically classify expenses eliminating non-value-added administrative work. In the case of companies that serve very small contractors like Jobber or WorkWave these credit cards can become essential tools to help an entrepreneur separate their business credit from their personal line of credit. In fleet management software these credit cards can simplify ongoing expenditures made by drivers. Fleetio for instance has a new integration with WEX | EFS fuel cards. The integration:

Automatically imports fuel transactions to Fleetio within five minutes of the transaction

Quickly identifies potential fuel theft in real time when a fuel transaction exceeds tank capacity or the vehicle is outside a specified vendor radius

Simplifies reporting on fuel efficiency/ cost-per-mile; analyze fuel by vehicle location vehicle type time frame

Streamlines IFTA reporting using Fleetio's Fuel Summary Location Report

Improves overall reporting by accurately determining total cost of ownership

Despite the five-minute lag between the transaction and its appearance in Fleetio the integration is still pretty quick and this speed will drive value in other areas of the business according to Fleetio Head of Product Management Michael Harrison.

“The amount of time decided on to reduce how often we made the API calls is within five minutes” Harrison said. “The transactions will often come in before five minutes which is faster than the industry average for connecting and downloading transactions for fuel data. This integration also leverages other functionalities that already exist such as Fleetio’s fuel exception alerting. While this functionality is not EFS specific EFS still benefits from it. The biggest functionality improvement is the speed at which the transactions come into Fleetio allowing fleet managers to take action on their fuel data faster. With the rising costs of fuel impacting a fleet's budget having the necessary data for reporting and analyzing is extremely important when evaluating expenses.”

Fleetio also supports integrations with other fuel card companies including Comdata and Fleetcor.



Takeaway: Finance companies are vendors and suppliers just as surely as companies that provide parts components and materials used in projects. Integrations with fintech can not only eliminate non-value-added administrative work but can make a contractor more resilient and capable of succeeding in the market.

Lord Lieutenant Mr President Prime Minister Taoiseach my Lord Speaker Lords Ladies and Gentlemen the Trimble family and above all Daphne Trimble; certainly a wife and helpmeet but also his greatest advisor in the public realm whom we also come to pay tribute to today.

David Trimble whose earthly remains lie before us today was the most prestigious and substantial figure thrown up by Unionism since the foundation of Northern Ireland in 1921.

The first to enjoy a global reputation. The distinguished congregation gathered here today in this Kirk at short notice in August is proof positive of one thing - that the title of David’s biography Himself Alone is in some urgent need of revision.

For David has never been less alone. In death he is finally being accorded the respect and love from all polities and communities in these islands; the respect and love in death which he deserves which he did not always receive in life when he was at the height of his powers -- and operating as he so very often did in most adverse circumstances. Those adverse circumstances obtained within his own party and community within all wings of Northern nationalism and within three governments in London Dublin and Washington which did not always have Unionist interests at heart. David might have possessed the moral high ground but it was armed republicans who often enjoyed the inside track. No other leader who played a key part in forging the Belfast Agreement had to contend with his range of challenges.

Lord Godson at the funeral of former Northern Ireland first minister and UUP leader David Trimble

When I started composing this address I sought the advice of a number of people pre-eminently Daphne and she replied to me “speak as if David was here and speak with the candour and honesty of the man.” I will follow her advice and I will start with this question. So what were the qualities in David Trimble the man that made him a great politician and a great statesman?

As a man he presents a complex picture. Everyone here knows that he was not an easy man in the conventional sense. But if he had been an easy man and an easygoing man he could not have achieved what he did. If one looks back at his professional and public life nothing came easily to him. Even to speak about him now is not an easy task. To the very end there was nothing “politically correct” about David. He was never co-opted into the easy ideology of conflict resolution - as are so many peacemakers across the world when they go into retirement. He was thran even spiky.

But the flip side was an unmatched tenacity a resilience which stood him in excellent stead throughout the terrorist violence of the Troubles which took the lives of a number of colleagues and students at Queen’s University. That toughness made him resolute in the face of physical threats after the Belfast Agreement from Loyalists and Republicans and also made him undaunted by a range of accusations from detractors within his own community from within pan-Nationalism and from a range of outside commentators. These included the idea that he was a “Lundy” or a traitor to his own folk; that he “didn’t want a Fenian about the place” -- that he would not share power with Catholics; and that he had not “sold” the Belfast Agreement hard enough to his own community and party.

When he became leader of the Ulster Unionist Party in 1995 David McKittrick wrote in The Independent that “25 years in politics have left no real indication that he has a vision beyond Unionism and Orangeism”. Ruth Dudley Edwards David’s greatest defender put this question to him -- and David replied “all will soon become clear.”

All soon did become clear. He proved his critics wrong. But he had to do so at his own pace and in his own style. Like the former law lecturer that he was he let his students to infer the meaning of his lessons rather than ram it down their throats. Although at times he could be irritable even ill tempered on the big strategic questions of the day he was cool as a cucumber. So cool that he didn’t even let moments of triumph turn his head. I remember that on the day that he and Seamus Mallon were elected First and Deputy First Ministers a Channel 4 film crew asked him “how do you feel about this historic day Mr Trimble?” “Fed up with hearing it’s a historic day” replied David.

His detractors dismissed such a sides as ungracious but it was just a sign of his modesty. There was a job to do. He wasn’t there to blow his own trumpet. When once I asked him what his triumph in winning the Nobel Peace Prize with John Hume of the SDLP he played it down mordantly saying “it’s just the statesman’s equivalent of an appearance in Hello! Magazine”.

His wit marked his greatest possession his intellect. This made him an object of suspicion. For some colleagues who dismissed his vast range of reading as mere “boffinry” and he you believed he could learn anything from a book. As a teenager he learned to drive his Rover 90 from the manufacturers’ manual and promptly crashed it on its first outing. He did not drive again until well into his 40s.

But that intellect was the making of him. It gave him the fluency and plausibility to be the first leader of Unionism to make a sustained case for that cause to the wider world and to argue the case for a New Unionism to the Unionists of Northern Ireland. Most important of all that intellectual self-confidence enabled him to work out why he himself could sign up for the Belfast Agreement in 1998. He was the only Unionist leader to have a serious interest in Republican history and to have considered the effects of his actions on the internal balance of forces within the Republican movement.

His legal and political intellect also meant that he saw the irredentist Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish Republic’s 1937 constitution as a violation of international norms. For him a key building block of peace was the emergence of a modernising Fianna Fail Taoiseach in Bertie Ahern who respected international norms and revised the Irish Constitution as part of a balanced accommodation on the island of Ireland. He would be delighted that Bertie Ahern is here today - and I know he would wish to acknowledge his salient part in the key constitutional provisions of the Belfast Agreement.

Certainly David loved the law. But his greatest public love was for our Westminster Parliament its highways and its byways. Until very recently he would take friends onto the roof of the Palace of Westminster between Big Ben and the Victoria Tower and would declare as if you were on his first visit “isn’t this marvellous?”

Unlike Sir James Craig the founding Prime Minister of Northern Ireland and the predecessor as leader of Unionism who David most admired David could never say that he was an Orangeman first and a Member of Parliament second. In his Nobel Prize speech drafted by his friend Eoghan Harris he spoke of Edmund Burke the Irishman for whom immersion in the larger forum of the British Parliament allowed his full genius to flourish. David might well have been speaking of himself.

For a loner he was a great believer in institutions and processes. After the triumph of the Belfast Agreement however he had two further great bits of unfinished business. The first was the integration of Northern Ireland’s politics into the wider United Kingdom system. One of the main reasons why he opted to take the Conservative Whip after entering the Lords in 2006 as a Crossbencher was precisely for that purpose.

The second referred to today by the Very Reverend Dr. Charles McMullen is of course the Northern Ireland Protocol. David viewed the Protocol as fundamentally subversive of the key provisions of the Belfast Agreement the Consent Principle.

To be clear he did not envisage the Consent Principle as a minimalistic concept applying only to the final stage of the transfer of sovereignty arising out of any future Border Poll but as applying to all major changes in the structure of that Agreement. For him a border for goods in the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Northern Ireland fell squarely into that category.

Right up to the last days of his life 20 years after leaving office David’s opinion still mattered very much to others - including long-time opponents who had broken with him over the Belfast Agreement. Like WT Cosgrave in the Irish Free State David’s stayed in office long enough to force his anti-Treaty opponents to play the political game within the revised rules that he himself had set.

He thought long and hard about this -- and would have noted with interest that one of the first messages I received after the news of his death came from Sir Jeffrey Donaldson: “David was undoubtedly a most courageous determined and passionate Unionist who wanted the best for Northern Ireland. Quite rightly history will look kindly on him and it now falls on us who remain to take forward his work and to secure the Union that he loved”.

Loved. Loved is the right word. As a public man in the arena David was not cold and uncaring. He cared more loved more than any politician I have ever known but critically like his religious faith he rarely showed it.",,,,,,,,,

Authorities had dubbed the suspect the ""old man bandit"" — and the man they say is responsible has a 45-year history of robbing banks.

Steven Gregory Gass Montgomery County Police Department

Steven Gregory Gass 67 has been charged with several bank robberies Montgomery County Police said Friday. The Frederick Maryland man is accused of attempting to rob a Wells Fargo on July 14 and a Truist Bank on June 18 along with a bank in Baltimore County.

Gass has a long history of bank robbery. He pleaded guilty in 2010 to robbing 19 banks in Florida and police said one of the first banks Gass robbed was in Montgomery County in 1977.

Police said the suspect entered the Truist in Bethesda wearing a large fisherman's hat and blue face mask and passed the teller a handwritten note announcing the robbery. He left the bank with an undisclosed amount of money authorities allege.

An employee of the Wells Fargo in Gaithersburg hit the silent alarm after a White man wearing a light-colored fisherman's hat sunglasses and a large face mask entered the bank handed the teller a handwritten note announcing the robbery police said. While the man left the bank without receiving any money officers saw Gass leaving the area and followed him to a Park and Ride where they arrested him according to a news release from the department.

Va. - Officials on the Eastern Shore have been dealing with a series of chicken gut spills on U.S. 13 since Saturday night.

According to Exmore PD Chief Angelo DiMartino the first spill was Saturday night around 9 p.m. DiMartino says it was a small spill and VDOT workers cleaned it up quickly. Fire crews also put down an absorbing compound called Speedy-Dry.

Another spill occurred around 10:30 p.m. VDOT crews were on scene cleaning it up until about 6 a.m. Sunday.

A third spill happened earlier Sunday afternoon in the northbound lanes of U.S. 13 in front of the McDonald's restaurant at State Route 652.

Around 1 p.m. a large fourth spill occurred in front of the Truist Bank at Shore Plaza. The last spill caused VDOT workers to hand-shovel a half-mile-long trail of chicken guts.

DiMartino said that the last spill was from a truck hauling for Valley Proteins. The driver was charged with failing to secure a load and driving with a suspended license.

News 3 has reached out to Valley Protein for comment.

Police warn drivers not to drive in this material if they see it. They say it smells really bad and could cause tires to skid if brakes are applied hard.

The New York Mets beat the Atlanta Braves on Sunday for the fourth time in five games but one Atlanta player certainly did not seem too impressed by the NL East leaders.

Braves rookie pitcher Spencer Strider the losing pitcher in Sunday’s 5-2 Mets victory chalked his opponent’s offensive output up to “a lot of luck” and “weird hits.” Strider concluded by suggesting the Mets’ luck could turn against them in October.

Spencer Strider on his outing versus the Mets: ""A lot of weird hits. They seem to be having a lot of luck right now offensively. That’s great. It’s August. (We’ll) see what things are like in October.” — Justin Toscano (@JustinCToscano) August 8 2022

Strider is likely frustrated by Pete Alonso’s key RBI double in the third which was a sharp ground ball down the third base line that hit the bag and deflected into the outfield. However that inning was capped off by a line drive double up the gap by Mark Canha that was not lucky in any sense of the word.

This is a pretty bold thing to say about a Mets team that is 70-39 and sits 6.5 games in front of Atlanta after Sunday’s contest. It also looks a bit silly coming from Strider after he gave up six hits and four earned runs in just 2.2 innings of work in the series finale no matter how they came. Teams that put the ball in play can sometimes get breaks and the Mets were able to take advantage of some against Atlanta.

The other problem with Strider’s logic is simple. Even if the Mets offense cools off a bit any team facing them in the playoffs will have to find a way past Max Scherzer and Jacob deGrom at the top of the rotation. deGrom has barely pitched in 2022 and they still boast the second-best team ERA in the league. There is nothing lucky about that. If those two perform to their capabilities their own ball boys might be the only ones capable of stopping them.",,,

Tyler was 30 years old a graduate of Dartmouth High School and Bridgewater State University when he took his own life in 2018.

His uncle Joel Baptista said Tyler's smile could light up a room but it was amazing how much that smile could hide.

""We saw some signs and help was provided but sometimes the pain is just too much and people can't see the light at the end of the tunnel"" Baptista said. ""We have a close-knit family but we just didn't know it would come to that.""

Jenelle Hickey is the coordinator of a program at Child and Family Services that assists young people at risk of suicide giving them the help they need to hopefully move forward.

Both Baptista and Hickey joined Townsquare Sunday this week to discuss suicide in our area.

After Tyler's death Baptista said his family decided to form a foundation to assist organizations working with young people on suicide prevention. That organization is Child and Family Services and Janelle Hickey's CBAT unit.

""We work with kids (ages) four to 17 who are in an acute mental health crisis"" Hickey said. ""That might mean depression anxiety or having suicidal thoughts and feelings.""

She said youngsters in the program stay about two weeks while personnel work on getting them to feel better.

CBAT currently has nine beds but it will grow to 15 when the program moves to the former Regal House building on Church Street sometime after the New Year. Hickey said her program is always full and sadly it's not uncommon for people at risk to have to wait for placement.

The Tyler Joseph Leonard Memorial Foundation will hold a fundraiser on September 10 from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. at the Allendale Country Club in Dartmouth. It will feature music dancing a silent auction and much more.

Proceeds from the event will fund a scholarship for a Dartmouth High School student and the CBAT program at Child and Family Services. For information and tickets visit thetylerjosephleonardmemorialfoundation.org.

Tanmiah is a fresh and value-added poultry provider along with other meat products animal feed health products and foods brand franchise operator.

As part of the agreement Tyson said it acquired a 15% stake in Tanmiah’s subsidiary Agriculture Development Company (ADC) and a 60% stake in Supreme Foods Processing Co. Regulators for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are still working to approve the transaction.

“This investment will enable us to access poultry supplies in Saudi Arabia to meet the growing demand for protein in the Middle East and other markets” said Chris Langholz president of International for Tyson Foods. “Expansion into international markets is a key part of our strategic growth plan and we’re pleased to better serve customers in this region.”

ADC is a fully integrated poultry company that produces broiler chickens and operates hatcheries and feed mills. It sells fresh poultry under the Tanmiah brand to retailers and foodservice customers. Supreme Foods produces a variety of value-added and cooked chicken and beef products with a distribution network spread across the Middle East including Saudi Arabia Kuwait Bahrain UAE Oman Lebanon and Jordan among others.

“The strategic partnership is expected to accelerate Tyson Foods’ and Tanmiah’s growth and generate significant value in the short and long term” said Tan Sun president of Tyson Foods APAC. “This will be primarily achieved through further expansion across the value chain and enhanced product customer and geographical diversification as well as improvement of production and other operational processes. The agreement will also see Tyson Foods and Tanmiah unlock long-term opportunities in the growing Halal food market.”

Another part of the agreement is Tyson Foods and Tanmiah’s commitment to expand the processing capacity of Supreme Foods. The companies said the expansion would double production capacity for Tanmiah in further processed products.

“We are delighted to be joining hands with a well-renowned global leader in food production to accelerate our growth and development agenda” said Zulfiqar Hamadani chief executive officer of Tanmiah. “Our strategic partnership marks a significant milestone in Tanmiah’s journey and demonstrates our commitment to growth and supporting Saudi Arabia’s food security objectives. We are ready to embark on this new phase with Tyson Foods whose commitment to animal welfare food safety sustainability and efficiency are very much in line with our own business model and sustainability framework. This transaction will not only reinforce our positioning in the domestic market but will also enable us to expand our global footprint through leveraging Tyson Foods’ long-standing relationships with customers worldwide.”

Tyson continues to expand its value-added capacity around the world. The company plans to open seven fully cooked plants outside the United States over the next two years. Six of the facilities will be in Asia and one will be in Europe.

This suggests that the broiler prevalence two weeks earlier can partly explain domestic Campylobacter infections with transmission via handling and consumption of fresh chicken meat.

However there is no simple relationship between prevalence in chickens bred for meat and patients. Additional factors also need to be evaluated to understand the transmission routes and epidemiology of campylobacteriosis said the study published in the International Journal of Food Microbiology.

The research explored the relationship between the proportion of Campylobacter positive broiler batches and the number of reported domestic human cases in Sweden.

Scientists applied two approaches for analyzing time series data using weekly bi-weekly or monthly data of human campylobacteriosis cases and prevalence of Campylobacter in broiler slaughter batches in Sweden between 2009 and 2019. Both data sets revealed a clear seasonality and a variation between years.

One model showed a close overlap in seasonal patterns in terms of timing and the proportional change of peaks from normal yearly levels.

Swedish situation

In Sweden slaughter of broilers is concentrated to a few slaughterhouses and the four largest cover 97.2 percent of all birds slaughtered. Increased demand has led to changes in production such as the introduction of thinning shorter empty periods between rounds of broiler batches in primary production and slaughtering during several shifts at the slaughterhouse.

The annual prevalence of Campylobacter in sampled slaughter batches has ranged between 2009 and 2019 from 5 to 15 percent but there is seasonal variation with the highest rates in late summer and lowest during the winter months. There is also a wide variation in prevalence in batches from different producers from virtually never to up to 30 percent of flocks.

An analysis was also done for a subset of the data not covering 2014 to 2018 when several national outbreaks occurred.

The inability of either model to capture and predict the extended period with a high number of cases during 2016–2017 indicates that increased broiler prevalence alone cannot explain the rise in human cases. These findings highlight the need for data of Campylobacter in broiler meat and genomic comparisons between isolates from humans and broilers said researchers.

It is reasonable to expect a lag between broiler prevalence at slaughter and identification of human cases given the time between sampling of slaughter batches the time meat is on display at retail the shelf life of fresh broiler meat the incubation period for Campylobacter infections and the time between onset of illness and visiting a physician.

The sampling date of broilers is in most cases the same day as slaughter poultry products reach the retail market three to four days later and the shelf life of fresh meat is about 10 to 11 days after slaughter.

Assuming fresh broiler meat is consumed on average seven days after slaughter that the incubation period range is 1 to 10 days with a median of three days and the median time between onset of disease and testing is four days this would result in a median two week lag between sampling of broiler batches and human cases which is in agreement with the study’s results.

Representing an 11% year-on-year reduction the company attributes the cuts to the reduced population remaining in the country and to their economic difficulties as well as many logistical challenges.

Compared to the corresponding period of 2021 poultry production was around 11500mt lower for the first six months this year at slightly more than 346000mt.

For the last quarter MHP’s total poultry sales in Ukraine were down 23% year-on-year at 140500mt. Of this figure domestic sales were 6% lower at almost 68000mt. However exports volumes for the period plummeted by 37% to 68552mt. Relatively more of the firm’s exports were shipped to Africa during the first half of 2022 compared to last year while the proportions to Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) were lower than in 2021.

While average sales price received by MHP was 55% higher in the second quarter than the corresponding period of 2021 for exported poultry products when expressed in U.S. dollars it was 7% lower in local currency (UAH).

Mixed performance for MHP’s Ukrainian vegetable oils grains

As well as poultry production growing oilseeds for vegetable oils and grains are also key parts of MHP’s business in Ukraine.

For the second quarter just ended sales of sunflower oil were 38% higher year-on-year. Accounting for the increase was an increase in the production of sunflower meal for animal feeds following formulation changes. In 2021 MHP had used more soybean meal in its feeds.

As a consequence the firm’s soybean oil sales were 23% lower in the second quarter than in the same period of last year.

MHP expects to harvest grain from 335000 hectares (828000 acres) this year. It reports that harvesting of winter rapeseed and wheat are on track and the spring crops are in good condition.

MHP reports lower output of meat products

For the three-month period just ended MHP reports sales of its processed meat products down 73% year-on-year. This category includes sausages and smoked meats. The company attributes this to the consequences of the war and to Ukrainian Bacon ceasing its operations in April of this year. Average prices of this product group were 9% higher than in the corresponding quarter last year.

Also registering a fall in sales were convenience foods. These were down 24% compared with the same period in 2021 but the average price improved by 16%. This was driven largely by increases in raw material prices the company reports.

Poultry product sales growth at Perutnina Ptuj

MHP’s poultry operation in the Balkans Perutnina Ptuj (European Operating Segment) has been unaffected by the invasion of Ukraine and its wide-ranging economic consequences.

Expansion in poultry production continued across the region over the second quarter of 2022. As a result 6% more chicken and turkey meat was processed at the firm’s facilities than in the corresponding period of last year. Latest output was around 31260mt.

At over 19600mt for the quarter just ended its poultry sales were 1% higher year-on-year while the average sales price was up 33% at EUR3.36 (US$3.42) per kilo net of tax.

For the first six months of 2022 the European operation achieved an 11% increase in production at just over 59800mt. At 37360mt sales of chicken and turkey were 5% higher year-on-year at an average sales price increased by 24% to EUR3.11 per kilo.

Increases in production sales and average prices compared to the corresponding period of 2021 were also reported for Perutnina Ptuj’s processed meat products. This category includes sausages and convenience foods.

In the second quarter these facilities produced 11000mt of sausages and convenience foods — an increase of 11% year-on-year. Sales were 4% higher at more than 10200mt while the average price EUR3.12 per kilo an increase of 11%

Compared with the same period of 2021 first-half production of these products expanded 13% to almost 21800mt. Meanwhile sales were up by 6% in volume and 9% in value.

More on MHP

In the last financial year (2021) MHP reported double-digit increases in revenue which led to significant growth in profitability.

MHP (formerly Myronivsky Hliboproduct) is the second largest poultry meat producer in Europe according to WATTPoultry.com’s Top Poultry Companies survey.

As the war in Ukraine continues MHP is working hard to keep its exports flowing but the company recently acknowledged that doing so “requires 24/7 attention and management.”

Food isn’t ‘woke’,"New York CNN Business —

So Cracker Barrel … It’s a restaurant you traditionally go to after church to eat an unholy amount of biscuits and gravy while your grandma stocks up country-themed tchotchkes and gingham-printed novelty dish towels embroidered with nonsense like “happiness is homemade.”

At least that’s my memory of it.

Point is it’s a wholesome place. But leave it to Facebook commenters to turn it into a battleground of the Great American Culture Wars.

Here’s the deal: Cracker Barrel added Impossible sausage to its menus. Perhaps because they realized (20 years too late in my case) that they weren’t really providing for the growing number of vegetarians and vegans in America who like occasionally are also hungry.

But of the more ravenous carnivores out there didn’t like the addition of “fake” meat and they didn’t hold back in their Facebook comments replying to Cracker Barrel’s post announcing the update. A sampling:

“I just lost respect for a once great Tennessee company.”

“Stop with the plant based ‘meat’ crap.”

“Bad choice.”

Several commenters decried the menu addition as “woke” an anti-racist term that has been co-opted into a pejorative against progressive actions and beliefs.

To be clear Cracker Barrel isn’t replacing its meat sausages with veggie alternatives. It’s not mandatory or anything as hundreds of other commenters noted in their retorts…

“It’s amazing the snowflakes here getting triggered by a meat alternative showing up on a menu. Y’all can still order regular meat you know that right?”

Ironically an Impossible sausage is supposed to look and taste just like a real meat sausage — it’s designed to pass for meat not make an obvious statement against it. A Cracker Barrel customer who is appalled by the new menu item likely wouldn’t realize if his neighbor got an Impossible sausage instead of a regular one. He might not even realize if the imposter product appeared on his own plate.

Cracker Barrel naturally stayed neutral replying that “The menu is always changing but our love for our customers never will.”

BOTTOM LINE: It’s a silly story of course. No one’s really going to boycott the restaurant over this. But it’s a fun/slightly horrifying glimpse at the way social media both magnifies and deepens cultural divisions on issues as minor as what someone chooses to eat for breakfast.

Over-the-top social media reactions to food news are common — so common that it’s spawned conspiracy theories that some changes are just stunts. After one well-known ice cream maker confirmed the death of its famous chocolate taco some wondered whether the move was just a hoax designed to create hype around the product. Choco Taco truthers are predicting a well-timed resurrection after people realize just how much they love and miss the sweet treat. (Choco Taco’s maker Klondike said this week that the reaction has made it reconsider its plans).

Companies are definitely paying attention to what customers are saying about their products online. That’s why we had a Taco Bell Hotel for a brief strange shining moment in time.

Effusive online ribbing can be a good thing for big restaurant chains and food makers. But it can also be toxic like when hateful comments appeared online for mom-and-pop restaurants over their Covid-19 vaccination policies.

At the end of the day Cracker Barrel’s move is a shrewd business decision.

The global plant-based meat market is expected to be valued at around $25 billion by 2030 – there’s clearly demand for it. And Cracker Barrel isn’t exactly breaking new ground here: Burger King has the Impossible Whopper; McDonald’s is working on its own version with Beyond Meat; even meat purveyor Tyson has its own chicken-less chicken products.

And what red-blooded American would have beef with a restaurant making such a purely capitalist decision?

Look at them boots. And cowboy hats. And empty beer cans and cups.

Minnesota has gone country. In a big way.

Officially 39030 people — about 500 over capacity — attended middle-tier country star Cole Swindell's post-Twins game concert Thursday at Target Field. More than 27000 partied this weekend with superstar Luke Bryan and others at the three-day 39th We Fest in Detroit Lakes. And Kenny Chesney the king of country stadium concerts drew 50150 revelers on Saturday to U.S. Bank Stadium.

He's earned that crown if only for his last decade in the Twin Cities. This was Chesney's sixth appearance since 2012 at a Minneapolis stadium — Target Field four times and now the Vikings palace twice.

In his first local gig since 2018 Chesney hit the stage in overdrive. He usually starts in fourth gear but this time the opening ""Beer in Mexico"" was supercharged fueled by hard-driving new drummer Nick Buda and additional guitarist Danny Rader who toured with Keith Urban for years.

Chesney has never sounded so loud amped and explosive. The guitars were cranked to 11 all night. And so was the star whose Minneapolis concert was postponed twice (because of the pandemic) since going on sale in October 2019. This was his most spirited and crowd-satisfying performance in a Twin Cities coliseum even if it was overloud.

Chesney seldom downshifted even for the slower numbers. ""Summertime"" is usually a breezy stroll but on Saturday it felt like a Corvette convertible cruising at 75 mph. ""I Go Back"" typically a midtempo reflection on younger days found Chesney so hyper that he was doing jumping jacks. ""Get Along"" a gentle simple-minded tune about well getting along with one another despite differences was transformed into a rowdy sing-along drinking song.

Even his classic country ballad ""Anything But Mine"" was blasted so loud that its bittersweetness was obliterated though Chesney's relatively quiet final line was one of his finest vocals.

Chesney did dial it down finally an hour into his 110-minute set for ""Save It for a Rainy Day"" when he was joined by two members of opening act Old Dominion who wrote the song. The island-flavored ""When the Sun Goes Down"" was pretty chill too assuring the No Shoes Nation that this superstar is not just a beach boy because ""everything gets hotter when the sun goes down.""

Whether it's day or night in a ballpark or on a gridiron Chesney touches all the bases — beer beaches romance and sentimentality.

More than any other act the tanned and toned Tennessean has made beaches part of the Nashville landscape and he proved it Saturday on his twin theme songs played back-to-back ""No Shoes No Shirt No Problems"" and ""We Do"" from his 19th and most recent studio album 2020's ""Here and Now.""

Chesney 54 is also big on sentimentality reflecting on old times Saturday in the ebullient jumping jack-punctuated ""Young"" the aforementioned ""I Go Back"" and ""The Boys of Fall"" his 2010 nostalgic ode to high school football that he dedicated to the Minnesota Vikings for letting him work out at their TCO Performance Center on Saturday morning.

Lacking the searing intensity of Eric Church (who in June drew a stunning 51117 to U.S. Bank Stadium) and the hammy showmanship of Garth Brooks (who attracted 70000 to USBS in 2019) Chesney was more like a hyperkinetic sweaty rock star in cowboy clothes. In other words a stadium full of fun.

In some of his previous Minneapolis stadium appearances Chesney had some pretty high-profile partners open for him including Tim McGraw Zac Brown Band Thomas Rhett and Jason Aldean. This time he chose three hitmakers with a little less muscle for a massive venue.

The acoustics of the Vikings dome didn't flatter honey-voiced Carly Pearce who deservedly was recently named CMA and ACM female vocalist of the year. With their hourlong set Old Dominion Twin Cities favorites for several years gave probably their strongest local performance with their energy and enthusiasm measuring up to the catchiness of their songs which are part pop part hip-hop part beach (thanks Kenny) and all hooks.

Dan + Shay who crushed it at Target Center last fall are big on pretty pop ballads (think yacht rock marketed as country music) which play fine on country radio but not necessarily with a beer-fueled here-for-the-party stadium crowd. Appearing immediately before Chesney they were far from the right table-setter until Shay Mooney's luxe tenor soared on the closing singalong ""Tequila"" which was about heartache not high times.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2EzNWRjN2NlLWRlZmItNDE4MS1iNTI4LWMwYjFlMzRlMWQwN9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US banks tout fossil fuel credentials after Republican ESG backlash,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

The four major money center banks in the U.S. have received a great deal of attention from investors and the media in the years since the Great Recession. The big banks suffered mightily during the worst economic downturn in decades as one would likely expect.

The coronavirus pandemic was an additional challenge for the financial sector. However those days have long since passed and the largest banks are generating profits at rates never seen before.

Many big banks have fully recovered and then some and have returned to paying hefty dividends to shareholders. You can download the full list of all 200+ financial sector stocks by clicking on the link below.

The big banks’ dividends were reduced to smaller payouts for years because of the Great Recession of 2008-2009 but in the years since they have resumed their dividend growth. Some have made better progress than others in the financial sector.

We view the industry favorably for long-term income investors. In this article we’ll rank them in order of attractiveness on a total return basis as derived from our Sure Analysis Research Database.

The 4 big bank stocks are ranked in order of expected 5-year annual returns in order from lowest to highest.

Big Bank Stock #4: Bank of America (BAC)

5-year expected annual returns: 6.9%

Bank of America provides traditional banking services as well as non-banking financial services to customers all over the world. Its operations include Consumer Banking Wealth & Investment Management and Global Banking & Markets. Bank of America should produce about $95 billion in revenue this year making it one of the largest financial companies in the world.

Bank of America reported first quarter earnings on April 18th 2022 and results were better than expected on both revenue and profits. Earnings-per-share came to 80 cents five cents ahead of estimates. Revenue rose 1.7% to $23.2 billion which was $110 million better than expected. The bank benefited from higher net interest income from higher lending rates as well as strong loan and deposit growth.

Source: Investor Presentation

Average deposits were up $240 billion or 13% to $2 trillion in Q1. Management said they expect further gains in the coming quarters from a favorable rate environment particularly given its strong growth in low-cost deposits. Average loan and lease balances were up 8% year-over-year to $978 billion so the bank still has just over half of its total deposits sitting idle. That could provide a significant loan growth runway should the bank deploy those deposits.

Bank of America noted it has no significant exposure to Russia and credit loss provisions came to just $30 million in Q1. That’s a huge decline from the benefit of $1.9 billion in last year’s Q1 but those were unwinding COVID provisions that never materialized.

Net interest income came to $11.6 billion in Q1 up from $10.2 billion a year ago. However non-interest income was down from $12.6 billion to $11.7 billion year-over-year.

Total returns are expected to reach 6.9% per year over the next five years. This makes BAC stock a hold but not a buy at this time.

Big Bank Stock #3: Wells Fargo & Company (WFC)

5-year expected annual returns: 10.1%

Wells Fargo was founded in 1852 and provides banking investments mortgages as well as commercial financing products through roughly 7000 locations in 30+ countries. Wells Fargo has nearly $2 trillion in assets to produce about $73 billion in annual revenue. The bank has relationships with one-third of U.S. consumers through its vast network of offerings.

Wells Fargo reported first quarter earnings on April 14th 2022 and results were somewhat mixed. Revenue was down 2.6% year-over-year to $17.6 billion which missed estimates by $230 million. However earnings-per-share were better than expected beating estimates by seven cents at $0.88 per share.

Source: Investor Presentation

Non-interest revenue fell 28% from the fourth quarter and 14% from the year-ago period as a combination of low loan growth and lower prevailing lending rates crimped revenue. The management team said loan growth picked up a bit towards the end of the quarter and that credit quality remains strong.

However it also said that the risk of higher credit losses from a potential recession may hurt loan performance in the quarters to come. Non-interest expense rose $700 million from Q4 to $13.9 billion but that was still slightly lower than the year-ago period.

Loan balances ended the quarter at $898 billion up from $875 billion at the end of Q4. Deposits were essentially flat at $1.46 trillion. Net interest margin was 2.16% up from 2.11% in the prior quarter and up from 2.05% in the year-ago period. Provisions for credit losses came to a benefit of $787 million down from a benefit of $875 million in Q4 and a benefit of $1.05 billion in last year’s Q1.

Wells Fargo stock has a 2.4% dividend yield. We expect the company to grow its EPS by 6% per year. Lastly the stock has a P/E of 10.3 which is below our fair value P/E of 11.5. Total returns are expected at 10.1% per year over the next five years.

Big Bank Stock #2: Citigroup (C)

5-year expected annual returns: 10.7%

Citigroup was founded in 1812 when it was known as the City Bank of New York. In the past 200+ years the bank has grown into a global juggernaut in credit cards commercial banking trading and a variety of other financial activities. It has thousands of branches produces about $71 billion in annual revenue.

Citi reported first quarter earnings on April 14th 2022 and results were much better than expected on both the top and bottom lines. Adjusted revenue came to $19.2 billion which was down about 2% year-over-year but beat estimates by nearly $1.2 billion.

Source: Investor Presentation

Likewise earnings-per-share came to $2.02 which was 56 cents better than expected. The earningsper-share beat was driven by better-than-feared results as Citi came off of a peak in earnings a year ago in addition to the company’s robust share repurchase activity that saw the share count decline by 6%.

Cost of credit came to $755 million in Q1 which was up very sharply from a benefit of $2.1 billion a year ago. The bank took a build for exposure to Russia in part.

Operating expenses were $13.2 billion down 3% from the prior quarter but up 15% year-over-year. Excluding divestitures expenses would have risen 10% year-over-year as the bank continues to invest in things like IT infrastructure partially offset by productivity savings.

We see expected returns of 10.7% driven by 5% expected EPS growth the 4.1% dividend yield and a 1.6% positive impact from an expanding P/E ratio.

Big Bank Stock #1: JPMorgan Chase & Company (JPM)

5-year expected annual returns: 11.4%

JPMorgan was founded in 1799 as one of the first commercial banks in the U.S. Since then it has merged or acquired more than 1200 different institutions creating a global banking behemoth with about $124 billion in annual revenue. JPMorgan competes in every major segment of financial services including consumer banking commercial banking home lending credit cards asset management and investment banking.

JPMorgan Chase reported first quarter earnings on April 13th 2022 and results were somewhat mixed with revenue coming in ahead of expectations while earnings missed the mark.

Source: Investor Presentation

Earnings-per-share came to $2.63 in Q1 which was seven cents less than expected. In addition earnings declined from $3.33 in Q4 of 2021 and from $4.50 in Q1 of 2021. Total revenue was down 5% year-over-year to $30.7 billion but did beat expectations by $170 million. Provisions for credit losses were $1.46 billion versus a benefit of $1.29 billion in Q4 and a benefit of $4.16 billion in the year-ago period.

Total loans ended the period at $1.07 trillion essentially flat with the prior quarter. Total deposits were $2.56 trillion up from $2.46 trillion as the company continues to take deposits without lending them. We see the loan-to-deposit ratio near 40% as a clear sign of management’s caution into the next few quarters.

Management approved a new buyback authorization of $30 billion starting on May 1st 2022. At the current share price such a buyback would retire about 8% of the company’s outstanding shares.

We expect JPM to grow its earnings-per-share by 6% per year over the next five years. In addition shares currently yield 3.3%. The stock also appears to be undervalued with a 2022 P/E of 10.8 compared with our fair value P/E of 12.5. Total returns are expected to reach 11.4% through 2027.

Final Thoughts

The big U.S. banks have come a long way from the Great Recession when their very survival was in question. A decade-plus removed from the Great Recession the 4 major U.S. banks are on much firmer financial ground. JPMorgan Bank of America Wells Fargo and Citigroup have returned to consistent profitability with much stronger capital ratios and balance sheets.

The future outlook for the big banks as a whole remains positive due to U.S. economic growth. While the big banks would be negatively impacted by a recession investors with a long-term horizon should find the U.S. banks to be attractive. All four offer strong yields dividend growth potential and reasonable or very cheap valuations. We like JP Morgan the best right now but note that three out of the four stocks are in buy territory today.

The body of Rebecca Dykes 30 was found dumped by the side of a Beirut highway on 16 December 2017. She had been raped and strangled with a rope with choke marks found on her neck.

She had been heading home from a night out with friends and had used the app to hail a car.

Driver Tarek Houshieh confessed to the ""senseless attack"" and was sentenced to death in 2017. He has since appealed to have his sentence commuted.

A much-delayed inquest into Ms Dykes's death took place at Southwark coroners court this week hearing evidence from Alyson King a security officer at the British embassy in Beirut.

Ms King said in 2017 staff were advised to only use three vetted taxi companies for personal travel according to The Times.

Ms Dykes's sister asked witnesses at the inquest if guidance had changed to actively urge staff against using Uber. She was told such advice was now given.

At the time Uber said it was ""horrified"" but denied reports Houshieh had been reported twice to the app for harassment and theft related to customers.

After the murder Lebanese interior minister Nohad Machnouk called Uber a ""virtual"" entity that is ""not safe"".

Lebanese people were warned to stop using the app and instead flag down traditional taxis.

Following the murder of Ms Dykes her family launched the Rebecca Dykes Foundation.

And a string of recent home sales and listings is throttling this island’s wealth connotation to new heights.

Where is this tony-sounding place? Hint: This island is known for its certain hue of red .

Manhattan may be home to Billionaires’ Row — a set of ultra-tall (and ultra-expensive) residential skyscrapers dotting the southern end of Central Park — but Massachusetts as of late can easily lay claim to Billionaires’ Isle.

Sorry The Hamptons. There’s a new one-percenter beachy paradise stepping into your spotlight. However locals insist their island located about 30 miles off the coast of Massachusetts isn’t a flashy spectacle like the Hamptons.

This is still an enclave in reserved Massachusetts after all.

“Despite the explosion of wealth on the island it still remains a remarkably civil and grounded place to be” said Bruce Percelay a longtime summer resident publisher of Nantucket Magazine and founder of the Boston-based real estate development firm Mount Vernon Co. “Pretense does not go very far here and the culture of the island still remains very much intact despite its growing affluence.”

Without naming names Percelay said he has seen people come and go with the idea that their flashy cars and brimming bank accounts would somehow give them a leg up in making a name for themselves on the island.

Nantucket is much more about making genuine connections with the community Percelay said. That often means coming together to raise money for a new hospital or helping out with those affected by the Veranda House hotel fire.

“There is just an intangible part of life on Nantucket where people who come here recognize that the size of their checkbook has absolutely nothing to do with their position on the island” Percelay said. “In the Hamptons if you drive an expensive car people are impressed. On Nantucket if you drive an expensive car people are turned off. It’s just an entirely different ethos.”

Keep in mind: Becoming a landowner on this island of reported lack of pretense and civility still comes at a hefty cost.

Four of the 16 most expensive homes for sale in Massachusetts in early July were on the island.

John Henry owner of the Red Sox and The Boston Globe closed earlier this spring on a $25 million Nantucket estate and later bought an adjoining property. The two properties’ combined $37 million sale price is the current record holder for the most expensive home sale on the island .

Stephen Schwarzman Blackstone CEO was reportedly the buyer last fall of a $32.5 million waterfront mansion overlooking Nantucket Harbor according to the Nantucket Current. That had been the most expensive home sale on the island until Henry’s. Another waterfront estate hit the market earlier this summer for $56 million. If it goes for its asking price the home would eclipse Henry’s as the most expensive home ever sold on the island.

“We’ve seen probably 17 or 18 deals over $15 million in the last 12 months and I think the market in general is still pretty healthy here as opposed to some other areas where you’re seeing more and more supply” said Michael Passaro a Douglas Elliman broker. “Obviously it’s an island and you’re not building out more. There’s a finite number of properties that can be built.”

Land on the island becomes even harder to come by when you factor in the Nantucket Land Bank which levies a 2 percent transfer fee on most property transactions on the island. That funding then goes to acquire land for open space agricultural or recreational uses. To date nearly half the island is preserved as open space.

But it likely isn’t the open space and small-town-at-sea charm that are making this island a magnet for some of the world’s wealthiest families.

Given its location privacy is a natural feature for anyone living on the island. Sure estates behind gates and set back from the road will always come with privacy but the fact that it takes legwork — and securing a spot on crowded ferries — to get to the island means there is even some degree of isolation walking around downtown.

“It’s not like you can get in a car and you’re going to run by big-box stores. You’re very secluded. People aren’t going to be bothering you” said Craig Brody a Boston-based real estate agent with Douglas Elliman. “That’s a big lure to the islands for sure.”

Property taxes on Nantucket are also significantly lower than in the Hamptons. Nantucket property taxes amount to $3.74 for every $1000 of assessed value — meaning the property tax on a $1 million home on Nantucket amounts to $3740. By comparison property taxes for a home at the same value in certain parts of the Hamptons comes to an eye-popping $273.25 for every $1000 of assessed value according to Town of East Hampton tabular statement for 2021 and 2022.

Additionally the Nantucket airport has a longer runway and fewer noise restrictions than the one in East Hampton.

Yes readers. Not only is Nantucket easier to access by private jet — its waterfront estates are a value play of sorts for the uber-wealthy.

“The Hamptons I think had a very good run. Nantucket is obviously a little bit different. It’s a little bit more relaxed. It’s a smaller area. It’s easier to get around” Passaro said. “I also think once a few wealthy people come or the billionaires’ club comes wealth definitely attracts wealth.”

Some folks may be scratching their head at the idea that Nantucket’s surge in home prices is recent history. The typical home value on Nantucket is just over $2 million according to Zillow. That’s nearly a 12 percent jump from last year. Believe it or not it hasn’t always been that way.

Before billionaires came a-buying Nantucket was the setting for Herman Melville’s “Moby-Dick” a nod to the island’s roots as a whaling hub. The author depicted the island not as one packed with billionaires and their estates but one of “all beach without a background.”

The island’s magnetic pull on those with a blue-blood background began roughly in the 1980s when fortunes ballooned off Wall Street locals say. It has accelerated further in the past two years.

“It’s always been super expensive and I think the prices just went up through COVID. Rich people made a lot of money in the last few years before COVID and even more during COVID especially in tech and some other things” said Gary Winn a Nantucket-based real estate broker with Maury People Sotheby’s International Realty. “It’s just a continuation of what’s been going on but it’s just stepped it up to another level.”

But the continued influx of new blood onto the island doesn’t mean everyone is living together in harmony.

Displacement of longtime residents and a severe shortage of workers (driven off the island by soaring home prices and rent) mean it is increasingly difficult to staff up and operate a business here. Finding a way to accommodate individuals of all economic backgrounds is key to keeping the charm of the island alive and not turning this slice of paradise into just another version of the Hamptons.

“The biggest negative repercussion of all of this is the cost of living for the working and middle class here because it is very high” Percelay said. “Without a working class and a middle class this island cannot function.”

Indeed in the week of 01-Aug-2022 intra-Europe capacity has now reached 90% of the equivalent week of 2019.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic the twin engines of Europe's long haul point-to-point operations were the North Atlantic and Asia Pacific.

North Atlantic capacity is now at 87% of 2019 levels - the same percentage as for the total market to/from/within Europe. Europe-Latin America another (albeit smaller) long haul market is on 90%.

Yet Europe-Asia Pacific in spite of improvement since Apr-2022 has reached only 49% of 2019 capacity. This reflects ongoing travel restrictions and the closure of Russian airspace to overflights.

While staffing issues are undoubtedly preventing the next surge in Europe's aviation capacity recovery only when Asia Pacific fully reopens can it reach maximum power.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8wNy9idXNpbmVzcy91cy1mbGlnaHQtY2FuY2VsbGF0aW9ucy1kZWxheXMtc3VuZGF5L2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAVFodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIyLzA4LzA3L2J1c2luZXNzL3VzLWZsaWdodC1jYW5jZWxsYXRpb25zLWRlbGF5cy1zdW5kYXk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More than 900 US flights canceled and 6300 US flights delayed on Sunday,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8wNy9idXNpbmVzcy91cy1mbGlnaHQtY2FuY2VsbGF0aW9ucy1kZWxheXMtc3VuZGF5L2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAVFodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIyLzA4LzA3L2J1c2luZXNzL3VzLWZsaWdodC1jYW5jZWxsYXRpb25zLWRlbGF5cy1zdW5kYXk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D84341000>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8wNy9idXNpbmVzcy91cy1mbGlnaHQtY2FuY2VsbGF0aW9ucy1kZWxheXMtc3VuZGF5L2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAVFodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIyLzA4LzA3L2J1c2luZXNzL3VzLWZsaWdodC1jYW5jZWxsYXRpb25zLWRlbGF5cy1zdW5kYXk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,,,,

Months after media personality Sheletta Brundidge called out Target and other large companies for making equity commitments but not investing in local Black media Target has signed on as an advertiser for her podcast network Sheletta Makes Me Laugh. The retailer which will begin airing ads on the network’s 10 shows in September joins a growing list of large Minnesota companies to support the Twin Cities-based platform including General Mills UnitedHealth Group and Comcast.

“All of a sudden I’m hotter than fish grease on Good Friday” Brundidge quipped in a recent interview with TCB. Brundidge an Emmy-winning comedian author mother and autism activist who was recently honored as one of USA Today’s Women of the Year hosts a Saturday show on WCCO Radio and does some fill-in work for the station. But after years of feeling sidelined by mainstream media she decided to launch her own podcast platform in 2020. Sheletta Makes Me Laugh draws around 25000 to 30000 listeners each week Brundidge estimated. The shows go beyond humor to cover finance parenting fitness and success with expert hosts including executive coach author and speaker Dr. Verna Price.

“I’ve been fighting for this and it feels amazing” Brundidge said. “I win and they don’t lose. I think [corporate sponsors] are starting to see the value in partnering with a Black outlet like mine.”

Target’s commitment

Target’s sponsorship of Sheletta Makes Me Laugh is part of the retailer’s commitment to spend 5% of its annual media budget with Black-owned media partners by the end of 2022. In May the company released an update on its progress reporting that Target has doubled the number of Black owned media partners it works with since 2020 and invested four times more with them compared to two years ago. Target also introduced a funding program from its in-house media company Roundel to increase the exposure of diverse-owned brands through paid media. The Roundel Media Fund will award $25 million in media to diverse owned and founded brands by the end of 2025.

Target touted its multiyear deals with large Black-owned media outlets including Revolt Essence and Black Love. In late 2021 when Target announced a startup competition show for Black Founders produced by Revolt Brundidge spoke out on social media saying that the retailer was ignoring local platforms with strong community ties like hers.

Target recently signed a two-month contract with Sheletta Makes Me Laugh which Brundidge called a strong start. She’s pushing advertisers for 12-month agreements which she received from General Mills Comcast and some others.

“This is not just a Juneteenth or Black History Month thing” Brundidge said. “They’re actually putting some weight on the promise. I needed to make sure they understand: we want to take your money but you also have to make a commitment to partner in community. We’re problem solvers.”

Advertisers as community partners

Brundidge urged General Mills and Children’s Minnesota to donate 1000 children’s books that she hand-delivered to the public library in Uvalde Texas following the shooting massacre that claimed the lives of 21 at the local elementary school. Back in April she arranged for one of her first big corporate sponsors HyVee to donate Easter hams to hundreds of North Minneapolis families.

“People are hurting—they need love. We’re in the community. People know us and trust us” said Brundidge who gets the calls from locals when they can’t afford a ham for the holiday. “These companies want an impact for their dollar. I’ve got people going out of their way to shop HyVee after they saw on my Twitter that HyVee brought an 18-wheeler full of hams to the neighborhood. You’re not going to get that in a 30 second ad. They’ve got to get out of the mindset of traditional media partnerships.”

That sort of grassroots support is exactly what Comcast wanted when the media and technology company engaged Brundidge’s platform to promote the Comcast RISE Investment Fund an economic development program to support small businesses. That let to promotions for Comcast’s efforts to get qualifying families in need connected to the Internet.

“We love her knowledge of the local landscape the reach and connections she has to help raise awareness. She goes above and beyond” said Jill Hornbacher senior director of external communications for Comcast Twin Cities Region which has a history of partnering with local influencers and diverse publications and platforms.

“Micro influencers are far more effective in delivering sales to the people who support them.” — University of Minnesota journalism professor Christopher Terry

These sorts of partnerships are the future but also University of Minnesota journalism professor Christopher Terry pointed out not all that different than the Golden Age of television when George Burns and Gracie Allen would be seen mopping the floor of their set with an advertiser’s cleaning products.

“If there’s one thing influencers have taught us: micro influencers are far more effective in delivering sales to the people who support them” said Terry whose research focuses on policy regulatory and legal analysis of media ownership. “For the quarter million it costs to get the Kardashians think how many ads these companies can buy with Sheletta. She can market to people in specific neighborhoods. That kind of targeting is very powerful.”

With the new funding Brundidge said she will be able to pay her podcast hosts and train the next generation of broadcasters and producers. “I’ve got to build generational wealth not just for me but for my community” Brundidge said. “I want to be able to pass out those Easter hams without calling HyVee.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hbWF6b24tb25lLW1lZGljYWxzLTUtdG8tMS1tb2RlbC0xMTM3MjcwNDMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon will leverage One Medical's '5-to-1 model' professor explains,"Amazon (AMZN) continues to redefine its reach with its latest acquisition of health care provider One Medical (ONEM) for $3.9 billion.

The e-commerce giant's latest expansion into the health care sector follows a pattern of purchasing companies that complement its existing digital services from its acquisition of Whole Foods in 2017 and to its deal with MGM completed this year.

""What One Medical has — which I think Amazon likes and there's a lot of synergy — is they have a subscription model"" Meghan Fitzgerald health care policy professor at Columbia University told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""They have what's called a 5-to-1 model. You get five virtual telehealth visits and one in-person visit right? Now that fits the Amazon model for possibly having an online experience.""

Amazon entered the health care sector in 2018 when it acquired PillPack which was subsequently rebranded as Amazon Pharmacy in late 2020. The platform is now a hub for ordering prescription medications at discounted rates.

The tech behemoth also found success when it created Amazon Care a telehealth benefit that enabled Amazon workers to consult doctors through quickened screening processes. The Amazon Care pilot program started in Seattle in 2019 and has since expanded to 20 other cities and other companies like Hilton (HLT) TrueBlue (TBI) and Sillicon Labs (SLAB). As of 2021 the program boasted coverage of up to 40000 workers.

But not all of Amazon's health initiatives have panned out. In 2019 Amazon Berkshire Hathaway and JP Morgan embarked on a joint venture known as Haven that was intended to disrupt the health care industry. Instead it disbanded in 2021.

""Amazon has learned to be very resilient and fail fast"" Fitzgerald said. She added that the company's success with PillPack and Amazon Care was ""really what gave them the confidence to make this acquisition and try to aggregate physicians in 25 markets.""

Prime member benefit

It remains to be seen how Amazon's One Medical deal will impact competitors such as UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and its subsidiary Optum Health or CVS Health's Aetna.

Fitzgerald characterized One Medical's membership-based coverage which starts at around $200 a year as an asset that ""fits the Amazon model.""

“I would imagine they'll either add it to Prime or there will be an upcharge to be a Prime One Medical subscriber” Fitzgerald explained. “In a lot of cases right now commercial-pay employers are paying the One Medical fee for their employees and it's being used as a benefit.”

The move would add value for Amazon Prime members who saw subscription fees increase by $20 to $140 per year in the U.S. and up to 43% more in Europe varying by region.

Story continues

However the deal which ""is more in the physician enablement model"" poses a challenge even for Amazon's logistical prowess Fitzgerald said. Practices opting for telehealth consultations are still having varied success in taking on issues of scale and availability for growing patient lists.

""I think aggregating primary care physicians has been the most difficult thing to do in the United States” Fitzgerald said. ""There was skepticism around how you can scale and still deliver quality which is really all that matters in health care especially if you're on a value-based contract where you're only being paid for quality. So Amazon is going to have to learn to put up those types of numbers.""

In other words while the messiness of the health care industry represents a huge opportunity for Amazon and other investors that have tried to cash in it's also fraught with potential pitfalls.

""There's a symbiotic benefit to help One Medical scale"" Fitzgerald noted. ""But I do not think the Amazon team should be the one running a clinical asset — they should leave that to the clinical experts.""

'A river too dangerous'

There are also concerns about patients' data privacy.

Some have speculated that Amazon could potentially use medical records to try and upsell products on its e-commerce platform leading experts like Fitzgerald to ask: “What is the HIPAA constraint around that?”

Amazon stated that as required by law it would never share One Medical patients' health data without their permission a spokesperson told MarketWatch.

But that doesn't mean Amazon's foray into the medical space won't fuel existing worries about how data is being used.

""It's a fair question I think for consumers to ask Amazon how that relationship is going to be protected"" Fitzgerald said. She explained that even though HIPAA is enshrined in law ""it doesn't mean that people aren't worried at the fringes [about] what it can mean to have a total picture of you now as a consumer.""

""I think that would be crossing a river too dangerous for Amazon to start taking patient data and then trying to monetize and use it"" Fitzgerald warned.

Cherrish Pryor (D-Indianapolis) speaks on the House floor on Aug. 5 2022 during debate on a near-total abortion ban.

Indiana Republican lawmakers voted Friday to force thousands more people to give birth every year in a state with some of the worst maternal and infant mortality rates in the country.

And Gov. Eric Holcomb quickly signed the near-total abortion ban into law.

""Following the overturning of Roe I stated clearly that I would be willing to support legislation that made progress in protecting life"" Holcomb said. ""In my view SEA 1 (ss) accomplishes this goal.""

Rep. Wendy McNamara (R-Evansville) the bill's House sponsor said it makes Indiana what she calls the most “pro-life” – that is anti-abortion – state in the country.

“It is consistent with our overall goal to care for mother and baby” McNamara said.

Abortions would only be allowed if the pregnant person’s serious health or life is at risk; if there’s a lethal fetal anomaly up to 20 weeks post-fertilization; and in cases of rape or incest but only up to 10 weeks.

Rep. Joanna King (R-Middlebury) the bill's co-sponsor said she believes life begins at conception.

""I believe life is a gift"" King said. ""This body has the duty to protect life.""

Rep. Carolyn Jackson (D-Hammond) said the bill is not about being “pro-life.” She said it’s about the state “punishing women for their biology.”

“And it is cruel it’s unjust and it’s downright despicable” Jackson said.

The House vote was 62 to 38 with nine Republicans joining every Democrat to oppose the measure.

Rep. Cindy Ledbetter (R-Newburgh) is one of those Republicans. She talked about her own unplanned pregnancy when she was young. She said she was poor when she came to Indiana and lacked access to health care services. Ledbetter said the state has failed to help provide services that could've prevented abortions over the years.

""I cannot in good conscience vote for this bill"" Ledbetter said.

Rep. Ann Vermilion (R-Marion) also voted against the measure. She called herself ""pro-life and pro-choice"" and said she worries the ban will galvanize voters and force Republicans out of office.

""I think we have to stop calling ourselves 'pro-life' if it only means we have a priority list on life"" Vermilion said.

In an emotional and at times tearful speech Rep. Maureen Bauer (D-South Bend) said she sees people getting involved in politics because of this issue ""as if their future depended on it.""

""Forced birth is not freedom"" Bauer said. ""Indiana's going to force women and girls to give birth when 50 percent of our state is a child care desert. Forced birth in the only wealthy nation that does not provide paid family medical leave. Forced birth in a nation where Black moms face higher rates of death from pregnancy and childbirth. Forced birth where we average one mass shooting per day and have no universal health care or universal child care.""

A few House Republicans who cast ""no"" votes Friday did so because they think the ban doesn't go far enough. One of those is Rep. John Jacob (R-Indianapolis). He's an anti-abortion extremist who believes all abortions should be banned even when the pregnant person would die.

""Human life begins at conception"" Jacob said. ""Murder is the taking of an innocent human being's life. And abortion always takes the life of an innocent pre-born human being.""

Rep. Renee Pack (D-Indianapolis) didn't hold back her anger at Jacob's remarks.

""Sir I am not a murderer. And my sisters are not murderers either"" Pack said. ""We are pro-choice. That is what we are. We believe that we have command over our own bodies. That's who we are.""

More than half of the House Republican caucus wanted a more restrictive ban. They voted Thursday for an amendment that would've stripped out the rape and incest protections.

But most of the them ended up voting for the final bill. Rep. Jeff Ellington (R-Bloomfield) likened it to leading 100 troops in battle. He chose he said to fight to save 93 of them rather than abandon all 100.

""I'm going to take this foundational building block and make a decision for the future"" Ellington said.

The Senate sent the bill to the governor's desk by a 28 to 19 vote.

Sen. Liz Brown (R-Fort Wayne) said the ban is the culmination of years of battles.

“We will always have more work to do because we need to make it unimaginable to end an unborn baby’s life” Brown said.

Sen. Shelli Yoder (D-Bloomington) said women shouldn’t have to ask for control over their own bodies.

“It’s not compassionate. It’s not pro-life"" Yoder said. ""It’s pro-punishment. Punishment of women who dare to live as freely as men.”

Indiana Right to Life one of the state's most influential anti-abortion organizations had long opposed the bill for not restricting abortion enough. And in a statement IRTL President and CEO Mike Fichter said the group still couldn't fully endorse the measure.

""We do acknowledge the path forward is to either embrace the potential to end the vast majority of abortions in Indiana now or to allow all abortions to continue under current law"" Fichter said.

Fichter applauded some changes to the bill made by the House particularly the provision banning abortion clinics from operating in the state.

In a statement Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates CEO Jennifer M. Allen called the measure an ""outrageous"" attack on maternal health.

""Indiana government is inserting itself into private decisions about when and whether to have children and it is unconscionable and unacceptable"" Allen said.

The ACLU of Indiana said its legal team is evaluating ""every legal avenue available"" to defend access to abortion.

“We are proud of you all for your achievement and your achievement should be an encouragement for other health facilities to participate in the programme” Pangnyu said while addressing the state level felicitation programme here at Capital Convention Centre.

In Nagaland Seikhazou UPHC is the first facility to be certified for NQAS in 2019.

Three additional facilities were certified for NQAS this year.

Pangnyu said that in alignment with the National Health Policy's aim to ensure Universal Health Coverage Ayushman Bharat was launched in 2018 with Health and Wellness Centre (HWC) and PMJAY (Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana) as its two strong pillars.

He said that Ayushman Bharat aims to bring a paradigm shift in the country by increasing health systems that are responsive to the increased demand of health seekers on prevention and treatment of diseases.

“We have completed four years of implementation of the prestigious Ayushman Bharat-Health and Wellness Centres in Nagaland thereby bringing quality care closer to homes of community with the provision of expanded ranges of services” the minister said.

Along with making health care services available accessible and affordable to the local population at their door steps it becomes more pertinent to ensure quality of care provided by health care providers. Therefore Ministry of Health and Family Welfare begun its journey of ensuring quality across the public health facilities since 2013 with the launch of NQAP he said.

Under the ambit of NQAP standard of care for various levels of health facilities- DH CHC PHC and SC has been framed he said

“Desde que salí de El Salvador tenía en mente abrir un restaurante salvadoreño” platicó don Efrén a La Opinión al recordar los años ochenta.

Su intención inicial era establecerse en Los Ángeles conseguir trabajo ahorrar y eventualmente establecer su propio negocio.

Ese sueño americano sin embargo poco a poco se transformó y dio paso a su sueño tijuanense.

“Después de una larga plática que tuve con un amigo que me decía que aquí también había posibilidades de hacer una mejor vida en 1989 decidí quedarme y probar suerte en Tijuana” dijo don Efrén.

Después de una vida militar de años en El Salvador el inmigrante trabajó en lo que encontraba oportunidad.

Primero vendió frutas y verduras en Tijuana luego consiguió trabajo como mesero más tarde lo contrataron en un bar después fue taxista y llegó a ser propietario de su unidad; también encontró empleo en una agencia de seguridad privada.

Efrén García propietario de Pupuseria El Salvador TJ.

Platicó que en todos esos y otros trabajos ahorró gradualmente siempre con la idea de establecer su propio negocio de comida.

El 11 de septiembre del 2021 don Efrén y su esposa Ana Lilian Granadiño finalmente inauguraron su restaurante la Pupusería El Salvador Tj (Tj como contracción de Tijuana).

Dijo que el mes que entra en el primer aniversario del restaurante “pensamos tener platillos especiales música que esté muy alegre porque la verdad yo estoy muy agradecido con México y en particular con Tijuana; aquí nos han tratado muy bien”.

En unos meses la noticia de que había un restaurante salvadoreño con sabor tradicional corrió entre los salvadoreños que se han quedado a vivir en Tijuana como inmigrantes e incluso entre los que han llegado con intención de cruzar la frontera a California.

“Desde que abrimos han venido yo diría que entre el 85 y el 90 por ciento de todos los salvadoreños que viven en Tijuana y también nos visitan salvadoreños radicados en California” dijo orgulloso.

El viernes en cuanto abrió el restaurante a las 10 de la mañana comenzaron a llegar clientes salvadoreños. El atol de elote estaba recién hecho y ya calentaban el comal para hacer pupusas.

Don Efrén explicó que el negocio tiene ocho empleados todos salvadoreños porque el origen de los trabajadores contribuye a que los alimentos tengan el sazón original salvadoreño.

“Tenemos más de 60 platillos en el menú” platicó don Efrén “muchos de esos platillos también les gustan a los clientes mexicanos” sin tener que prepararlos de manera distinta a la original.

Muchos comensales mexicanos ahora saben cómo quieren exactamente sus pupusas de entre una variedad de unas 20 pupusas diferentes. Muchos piden de camarón con queso o de queso con champiñones o pupusas revueltas por ejemplo.

Don Efrén dijo que en cuanto a las pupusas ya sean clientes mexicanos o centroamericanos se les ofrecen las opciones de un curtido con chile o regular y salsa picante y la tradicional salsa de tomate.

Los vecinos compran mucho los tamales caldos de res o de gallina. Tijuana es ciudad de inmigrantes y para muchos mexicanos de estados del sureste y sur consumir yuca y plátano frito es parte de su alimentación tradicional lo que también ha influido para ganar clientela.

Don Efrén quien viste orgulloso camisetas con los colores y las iniciales ES de El Salvador explicó que “no me puedo quejar nos ha ido muy bien y gracias a Dios cada día tenemos más clientela”. Así que también ha reforzado el personal.

Trabaja con compatriotas

Hacía cuatro años que Carolina Vega había llegado de El Salvador y vivía en la Ciudad de México. Dijo a La Opinión que un día hace unos cuatro meses al navegar por páginas de Facebook encontró la Pupusería El Salvador Tj.

Carolina llamó por teléfono a don Efrén para saludarlo. Resulta que no solo eran paisanos “éramos vecinos en el Departamento de San Vicente” dijo Carolina Vega. Ella tenía en su casa en El Salvador precisamente una pupusería donde don Efrén consumía habitualmente.

No tuvieron que charlar mucho antes que acordaran que Carolina viajaría a Tijuana para trabajar como encargada del restaurante.

Ahora Carolina Vega responsable de abrir el restaurante en las mañanas luce orgullosa un escudo nacional de El Salvador bordado sobre su bíceps derecho en la camiseta con los colores de su país.

“La verdad yo me siento feliz” comentó Carolina Vega “porque trabajo en lo que a mí me gusta lo que sé hacer” y dijo alegrarse cada vez que complace a sus paisanos que extrañan los sabores de su tierra y a clientes que visitan de ambos lados de la frontera el restaurante.

Para don Efrén el restaurante significa el logro de toda una vida. “Cuando yo era niño vivíamos en la calle” platicó.

Su familia vendía verduras y a veces fruta para sobrevivir hasta que su mamá pudo ahorrar para comprar un pequeño terreno donde la familia construyó una casa humilde.

En esas condiciones el pequeño empresario de Tijuana en El Salvador solo pudo estudiar tres años aunque platica que su sueño entonces era ser profesionista. En su pubertad a los 13 años de edad se inscribió en el ejército.

Recuerda que fueron años muy difíciles “morían muchos soldados; en mi promoción en 1982 éramos 160 soldados y cuando causamos baja nada más éramos 37”. Había sobrevivido y se quedó todavía un tiempo más como voluntario. Hasta que comenzó a repasar la idea de llegar a Estados Unidos pero se quedó en Tijuana.

“Desde que conocí esta ciudad me gustó” explicó don Efrén. Como taxista la recorrió tanto que posiblemente conoce más sitios de Tijuana que muchos residentes del estado de Baja California.

Ahora a unas semanas de cumplir un año su negocio don Efrén piensa que “siempre es posible progresar si se tiene fe y se es emprendedor y está uno dispuesto a trabajar”.

Y a medida que crece el negocio dijo también apoyar a otros. Esta semana es la primera de trabajo de Marvin también salvadoreño asistente en el restaurante.

Don Efrén sube a menudo videos en vivo en su página de Facebook Pupusería El Salvador Tj donde las personas interesadas también pueden encontrar su número telefónico y direcciones en mapa de Google para llegar al restaurante en la colonia Jardín Dorado.

En la comparación contra junio los ingresos de este sector declinaron un -44%.

El primer domingo de julio la CAME dejó de lado la difusión de las cifras miminoristas mensuales. Fue el mismo fin de semana en el que renunció de forma sorpresiva el ministro de Economía Martín Guzmán. Ver CAME freeza índice // Ver CAME posterga.

Y hoy un mes después y como si nada hubiera acontecido la institución informó sobre el desempeño de las ventas minoristas PyMES de julio. Las mismas medidas a precios constantes dijeron que declinaron -35% frente al mismo mes del año pasado. Ver comunicado.

De modo que esta vez la entidad no está en condiciones de mostrar cómo fue la comparativa de las ventas de julio frente a junio. Así siempre era la metodología que se reflejaba mes a mes como en el caso de mayo en el que se mencionó que las ventas habían retrocedido -8.9% frente al mes de abril. De todas maneras indicó que las ventas bajaron -6% respecto de junio. Ver mentas de mayo.

El mes pasado «la incertidumbre sobre el futuro de corto plazo los problemas de abastecimiento y los movimientos atípicos de precios caracterizaron los principales comentarios de los comerciantes relevados» detalló el informe.

Cuatro de los seis rubros encuestados redujeron en julio sus ventas interanuales. Así en la comparación intermensual estas bajaron -6% respecto a junio y los sectores se retrajeron. En julio Ferretería Materiales Eléctricos y Materiales de la Construcción fue el que mejor performance presentó al anotar un incremento del 48% en los últimos 12 meses.

En segundo lugar se ubicó el canal Farmacia y Perfumería y Cosmética cuyas ventas crecieron un 32% interanual en julio aunque bajaron -44% en la comparación mensual. Los negocios consultados destacaron «los problemas y demoras que están teniendo para cobrarle a las obras sociales. Esta situación genera cierto desfasaje financiero dado que los precios de reposición terminan siendo más elevados« según se puntualizó en el reporte.

Los resultados se obtuvieron en base a respuestas de 1.087 comercios brindadas entre el 1° y el 5 de agosto en las capitales y principales ciudades del país.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpYnJpZG9zeWVsZWN0cmljb3MuY29tL2NvY2hlcy9tZW5vcy1jb2NoZXMtbXVjaG8tbWFzLWNhcm9zLWN1YW50by1nYW5hbi1mYWJyaWNhbnRlc182MTExMl8xMDIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Venden menos coches pero mucho más caros: ¿cuánto ganan los fabricantes?,"No hace falta recordar la serie de acontecimientos que están poniendo a prueba la economía global. Desde la pandemia del covid-19 hasta la guerra en Ucrania pasando por las tensiones entre China y Estados Unidos unas cosas y otras han derivado en un aumento disparado del precio de la energía del acero el aluminio el litio el cobalto y prácticamente todas las materias primas; en escasez de semiconductores de cables y otros componentes; y por si fuera poco los precios del transporte -imprescindible para llevar las cosas de un sitio a otro- también se han disparado. Con todo los fabricantes de automóviles no pueden producir coches al ritmo que les gustaría pero eso no ha impedido que estén consiguiendo pingües beneficios.

Si uno atiende solamente a las cifras de ventas cabría razonar que la industria del automóvil atraviesa un momento complicado. Y no nos engañemos los problemas en la cadena de suministro están poniéndolo muy difícil. También lo tienen cuesta arriba los clientes que están asumiendo precios mucho más altos que hace algunos meses. Pero a los fabricantes les salen las cuentas (al menos a la mayoría) y de hecho les salen más abultadas que nunca.

Muchos de los grandes fabricantes automovilísticos están obteniendo mayores beneficios que nunca algunos incluso facturando menos. Esto es gracias a unos márgenes de beneficio mucho mayores es decir coches mucho más caros. Indudablemente el afectado es el bolsillo de los clientes. Audi por ejemplo ha conseguido la mayor rentabilidad de su historia en el primer semestre de este 2022 aumentando su margen más de un 50% respecto al mismo periodo del año anterior. El grupo Stellantis ha aumentado un 34% sus beneficios a pesar de que ha vendido menos coches. Y así podemos contar un nutrido grupo que detallaremos a continuación que da muestra de la situación actual. Se venden menos coches pero con mucho -muchísimo- mayor margen lo cual no hace sino aumentar los beneficios de las compañías. Eso sí no todas corren la misma suerte.

Audi: 4.933 millones de euros

La marca de Ingolstadt perteneciente al Grupo Volkswagen ha vendido 785.099 coches en la primera mitad de 2022 un 20% menos que en la primera mitad del año pasado. Sus ingresos han crecido 700 millones de euros (+24%) pero lo que se ha disparado como un cohete han sido sus beneficios.

Pese a vender un 20% menos coches los beneficios operativos de Audi han crecido un 58% en comparación con en el primer semestre del año anterior alcanzando los 4.933 millones de euros.

El Audi e-tron GT (imagen) es uno de los eléctricos de la gama Audi

Por eso no es de extrañar que la marca de los cuatro aros haya alcanzado en este primer semestre el mayor margen de beneficio de su historia: un 165%. Esta cifra supone un aumento del 54% respecto al mismo periodo del año anterior cuando Audi obtuvo un margen de beneficio del 107%.

Como ocurre en prácticamente todos los fabricantes las ventas de eléctricos fueron mayores que el año anterior. La compañía alemana consiguió vender 50.033 coches eléctricos un aumento del 527% respecto al primer trimestre de 2021. Esto deja una cuota de eléctricos del 63% sobre el total de ventas de la marca.

BMW: 13.232 millones de euros

El Grupo BMW ha vendido 1.160.094 coches en el primer semestre de 2022 lo que supone un descenso del 134% en el cómputo interanual. De ese total 1.016.228 unidades corresponden a coches de la marca BMW (-137%). La única marca del grupo que ha vendido más coches que el año pasado es Rolls-Royce (+68%).

El grupo alemán facturó 65.912 millones de euros en los seis primeros meses del año un 191% más que el año anterior con un beneficio neto de 13.232 millones de euros lo que supone un aumento del 736% en la comparativa interanual. Pese a la caída de las ventas la facturación ha subido por el aumento de precios y la consolidación de la filial china BMW Brilliance Automotive (BBA) que ha contribuido con 11.000 millones de euros al volumen de negocio del grupo.

Nuevo BMW Serie 3 híbrido enchufable

No obstante su beneficio operativo cayó hasta los 6.817 millones de euros (-151%). El margen de beneficio operativo se situó en el 245% a nivel grupo y en el 82% para la división de coches. Este margen se ha visto afectado por la consolidación de la filial china BMW Brilliance Automotive mencionada antes.

Si nos centramos en los coches eléctricos puros BMW vendió 75.980 unidades a nivel global un 1103% más que durante el mismo periodo del año pasado.

Hyundai: 3.661 millones de euros

La marca surcoreana vive un momento dulce. Sus ventas caen menos que la media y su imagen de marca es mejor que nunca. Hyundai ha vendido 1.877.193 coches en todo el mundo durante el primer semestre un 76% menos que el año pasado de los cuales casi 100.000 han sido coches eléctricos puros.

El Hyundai Ioniq 6 es el último lanzamiento eléctrico de la marca

La compañía ha obtenido unos ingresos de 49.910 millones de euros en el primer semestre de 2022 lo que supone un aumento del 149% respecto al mismo periodo del año anterior. El beneficio operativo se disparó un 386% hasta alcanzar los 3.696 millones de euros mientras que el beneficio neto ha aumentado un 388% hasta alcanzar los 3.661 millones de euros al cambio actual.

Kia: 2.190 millones de euros

Kia perteneciente al Grupo Hyundai Motor ha vendido 1.419.488 coches entre enero y junio de 2022. Es una cifra ligeramente inferior al año pasado alrededor de un 3% menos concretamente pero es una de las marcas que menos sufre en este sentido. Hyundai vendió 87.150 coches eléctricos en el primer semestre más del doble que el año pasado.

El Kia EV6 GT es el modelo más potente de la historia de Kia

La firma que abandera Rafa Nadal por todo el mundo ha tenido unos ingresos de 30.300 millones de euros en el primer semestre un 152% más que el año pasado con un beneficio operativo de 2.900 millones de euros (+503%). El beneficio neto ha aumentado un 223% hasta los 2.190 millones de euros. En el segundo trimestre del año Kia reportó un margen de beneficio del 102%.

Stellantis: 7.960 millones de euros

Stellantis tuvo unos ingresos de 88.000 millones de euros en el primer semestre del año (+17%) e incrementó un 44% su beneficio operativo hasta alcanzar los 12.374 millones de euros. La compañía obtuvo un beneficio neto de 7.960 millones de euros un 34% más en comparación con el mismo semestre del año anterior.

El Peugeot 408 es uno de los modelos más recientes de Stellantis

De nuevo los mayores beneficios se han conseguido gracias «a una mayor rentabilidad operativa y comercial» según la propia compañía. Las ventas de coches de todo el grupo cayeron un 74% hasta los 303 millones de unidades a nivel global pero el grupo Stellantis alcanzó una rentabilidad récord en el primer semestre de 2022 con un margen de beneficio del 141%. Una subida notable respecto al 114% de rentabilidad obtenido en el primer semestre de 2021.

El grupo automovilístico franco-ítalo-estadounidense destacó el aumento de ventas de vehículos eléctricos: con un total de 136.000 unidades las ventas de eléctricos aumentaron un 50% en comparación con la primera mitad de 2021.

Tesla: 5.450 millones de euros

Tesla es una de las pocas compañías cuyas ventas han crecido considerablemente en lo que llevamos de año si lo comparamos con el año anterior. Tesla entregó 564.743 coches en la primera mitad de 2022 un 463% más que el mismo periodo del año anterior.

La compañía que preside Elon Musk obtuvo unos ingresos de 34.870 millones de euros en el primer semestre de 2022 un incremento del 573% respecto al mismo periodo del año pasado. Hubo un tiempo en que los créditos regulatorios suponían una parte importante en las cuentas de resultados de la compañía estadounidense. Ahora sin embargo el 882% de sus ingresos proviene de la venta de coches.

Tesla Model Y

Tesla obtuvo unos beneficios de 5.450 millones de euros en el primer semestre un 253% más que en el mismo periodo de 2021 con un margen de beneficio operativo del 17%. No obstante la rentabilidad de Tesla disminuyó al 146% en el segundo trimestre del año debido a los mayores costes de las materias primas los productos básicos y la logística; los mayores costes fijos por coche en Shanghái debido a las paradas de la fábrica; el impacto negativo del tipo de cambio (revalorización del dólar frente a otras divisas); y a las pérdidas sufridas en su inversión en Bitcoin. La compañía ha vendido en pérdidas el 75% de la posición que tenía en Bitcoin.

Volkswagen: 1.860 millones de euros

Los beneficios de la marca Volkswagen aumentaron un 547% pasando de 1.200 millones de euros a 1.860 millones en la primera mitad de 2022. La rentabilidad de la marca sobre las ventas se disparó un 647% pasando del 34% del año pasado al 56% del último semestre.

Todo ello a pesar de que Volkswagen Passengers Cars (la división de turismos de la marca Volkswagen) vendió un 215% menos coches que el mismo semestre del año pasado quedándose en 1.210.000 unidades a nivel global. A pesar de este importante descenso interanual en las ventas la compañía generó unos ingresos de 33.200 millones de euros sólo un 7% menos que en el primer semestre de 2021.

De nuevo la nota positiva en ventas la ponen los coches eléctricos: Volkswagen vendió en el primer semestre 116.000 coches eléctricos un 25% más que el mismo periodo del año anterior (en Europa el aumento fue del 40%). El modelo más vendido fue el Volkswagen ID.4 con alrededor de 63.000 entregas casi la mitad del total de los eléctricos de Volkswagen.

Volkswagen ID. Aero

A nivel de grupo la cifra de negocio aumentó un 2% hasta los 132.285 millones de euros. Sin embargo su beneficio neto se disparó un 27% en comparación con el primer semestre de 2021 alcanzando los 10.296 millones de euros. El beneficio operativo del grupo alemán ascendió a 12.828 millones de euros un 13% más que el año anterior con un margen operativo del 97%.

A nivel grupo las ventas del Grupo Volkswagen en su conjunto cayeron un 222% hasta los 3.875.000 vehículos. De ese total los vehículos eléctricos contabilizaron 217.000 unidades en la primera mitad del año un 27% más.

No todas ganan más que antes

Ha quedado patente que muchos de los grandes fabricantes han disparado sus beneficios y rentabilidad a pesar de la complicada coyuntura actual. Sin embargo no todas bailan al mismo son. No todos los fabricantes de coches han aumentado sus beneficios en lo que llevamos de año. Por ejemplo Mercedes-Benz ha tenido un 16% menos de beneficio neto que en el primer semestre del año pasado obteniendo 6.784 millones de euros de beneficio neto en los primeros seis meses de 2022.

Toyota por su parte ha visto reducido su beneficio neto un 179% en el primer trimestre del año fiscal 2023 japonés (abril-junio). La compañía nipona obtuvo unos beneficios netos de 736.820 millones de yenes 5.392 millones de euros al cambio actual. En lo que a ventas se refiere Toyota ha vendido 5.137.811 coches en todo el mundo durante la primera mitad del año un 6% menos interanual.

Dentro del grupo Volkswagen Skoda ha aumentado sus ingresos un 02% pero sus beneficios han caído un 306% en comparación con el primer semestre de 2021 quedándose en 676 millones de euros. La firma checa entregó 360.600 coches en la primera mitad del año un 30% menos que el mismo periodo del año anterior."

What happened

Shares of Verizon Communications (VZ 0.79%) fell 9% in July 2022 according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. By contrast the S&P 500 market index rose 9.1% in the same period leaving Verizon investors far behind.

So what

The bulk of Verizon's market pain last month sprung from a disappointing second-quarter report. Big Red fell slightly short of Wall Street's earnings estimates while meeting revenue expectations with a completely flat year-over-year comparison.

More to the point Verizon's subscriber addition figures didn't impress anybody. The company added just 12000 postpaid wireless subscribers in the second quarter along with 36000 net new Fios internet customers. In comparison the telecom added 878000 postpaid wireless customers and 92000 Fios accounts in the year-ago period.

Now what

Verizon's sluggish subscriber growth was a result of weak consumer demand for wireless phones and high-speed data services. This is an ongoing trend that Verizon's management has been referencing in the last three earnings reports but it has not found a successful antidote to this core issue. And that's not the whole story.

""The inflationary environment is clearly impacting consumer behavior and we also saw intensified competition for consumer attention"" CEO Hans Vestberg said on the earnings call. In other words on top of the inflation-based market challenge Verizon is losing subscribers to the competition.

Verizon's knee-jerk reaction to weak subscriber additions has been to raise consumer prices -- a move that isn't particularly effective when it comes to finding new customers. This trend reminds me of the movie industry where theaters and studios have been fighting lower ticket sales with higher prices over the last couple of decades. It shouldn't come as a surprise when these price increases fail to ignite an impassioned surge in customer growth. In this way the telecom market looks a lot like Hollywood.

All of this is to say I'm not surprised to see subscribers staying away from Verizon's rising prices. The company is trying its hand at less expensive promotions but it's the long-term costs that need to be adjusted here. Don't forget that Verizon is a hyperefficient cash machine generating $17.7 billion of operating cash flows in the first half of 2022. The telecom company can easily afford to slow its cash-profit roll for a while if it wants to get back to robust subscriber growth. I think that's a good idea.

Until that happens I'm not a Verizon buyer. Let's just say I'm not holding my breath while waiting for a lower-priced sales strategy here.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL21vYmlsZS93aGVuLWRpZC01Zy1jb21lLW91dC1jb21wbGljYXRlZC1oaXN0b3J5LXJlbGVhc2Uv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlnaXRhbHRyZW5kcy5jb20vbW9iaWxlL3doZW4tZGlkLTVnLWNvbWUtb3V0LWNvbXBsaWNhdGVkLWhpc3RvcnktcmVsZWFzZS8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,When did 5G come out? The long complicated history of its release,"Although 2022 will likely be heralded as the year 5G truly went mainstream we’ve traveled a long and winding road to get here. Carriers began actively working on preparing this leading-edge cellular tech as early as 2015 but it wasn’t until the end of 2018 that the first 5G mobile towers came online. It also took until 2020 before 5G was much more than a curiosity for early adopters.

Although previous cellular technologies like 4G/LTE also spent a long time in the research and development stages those didn’t experience nearly the same growing pains that 5G has. When 4G/LTE services began rolling out broadly in 2011 it was the same basic technology across all the major U.S. carriers.

Things have been considerably more complicated with 5G. Since the newer technology promises the kind of performance previously exclusive to wired broadband services it comes with more demanding requirements and runs over a much wider range of frequencies.

This has made deploying 5G somewhat more challenging as carriers try to find more radio spectrum to carry the best 5G signals. They also need to keep their 4G/LTE networks running at peak performance while sharing the airwaves with new 5G services.

The humble beginnings of 5G

Many folks don’t know that the first 5G deployments in the United States weren’t for mobile devices at all. In 2017 the carriers began trialing fixed wireless 5G services as a replacement for wired broadband home internet. Closed trials of 5G home internet ran well into 2018 before becoming commercially available later that same year.

It wasn’t until early 2019 that the first 5G mobile networks rolled out. Verizon led the way in April with a relatively small 5G footprint in core areas of Chicago and Minneapolis arguably beating out three South Korean carriers to become the first commercial 5G smartphone service on the planet.

Verizon expanded its service to several other cities throughout 2019 including Denver Providence St. Paul Atlanta Detroit Indianapolis Washington D.C. Phoenix Panama City New York City Dallas Omaha Houston and Boston.

The carrier had all these cities under its belt before rivals T-Mobile and AT&T turned the switch on their own 5G networks but there was a big catch. As a result of Verizon’s use of the extremely high frequency (EHF) — and extremely short range — millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum 5G service in each of these cities was confined to very small and specific areas. Stray more than a block away from a 5G zone and you would quickly find yourself back on the carrier’s standard 4G/LTE service.

The upside is that if you were near one of these rare mmWave 5G towers you could experience phenomenal speeds. It wasn’t uncommon to see speeds in the 500 to 1000Mbps (1Gbps) range.

Sprint had also begun dipping its toes into 5G in early 2019 using the mid-band 2.5GHz spectrum that was already carrying its 4G/LTE traffic. Those deployments were relatively short-lived though as a year later it would find itself folded into the new T-Mobile which had other plans for that spectrum.

Expanding 5G across the nation

While Verizon focused on delivering the fastest possible 5G speeds to tiny areas AT&T and T-Mobile were working instead on building more expansive 5G networks using low-band frequencies that could travel much greater distances.

Both carriers turned on their larger 5G networks in December 2019 with T-Mobile claiming its network covered 200 million people out of the gate while AT&T only promised coverage for “tens of millions” of its customers. This isn’t to be confused with AT&T’s 5G Evolution (5GE) network which launched in 2018 but was really just a misleading name for its advanced 4G/LTE services.

The two carriers used different pieces of the low-band spectrum with AT&T using higher frequency signals that were paired with its 4G/LTE network in key cities — only about 15 during its initial launch — while T-Mobile piggybacked on its 600MHz spectrum that was already covering vast swaths of the countryside. By mid-2020 T-Mobile was able to leverage that spectrum to boast 5G coverage in all 50 states including Alaska.

Verizon didn’t join the nationwide 5G party until late 2020 when it rebranded its mmWave 5G service as its 5G Ultra Wideband (5G UW) network. It did this to make room for a new 5G Nationwide offering that it said would deliver 5G to 200 million more people throughout 1800 towns and cities across the nation.

The first 5G smartphones

The earliest 5G deployments were exciting but a bit premature — especially Verizon’s. When the first mmWave cells went live in Chicago there were barely any handsets that supported 5G at all — much less the mmWave flavor of 5G that Verizon used.

In fact the only compatible handset on the market at the time of that initial 5G launch was Motorola’s midrange Moto Z3 which was sold exclusively on the Verizon network. It also required a separate Moto Mod add-on module to provide 5G compatibility.

The Moto Z3/Moto Mod solution was a strange arrangement but fortunately 5G enthusiasts didn’t have to wait long for more options. Samsung’s Galaxy S10 5G and LG’s V50 ThinQ came along in May followed by the Huawei Mate X OnePlus Pro 7 5G Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 5G and ZTE Axon 10 Pro 5G.

Those early 5G smartphones also had another critical catch. In 2019 Verizon and Sprint were offering 5G services but doing so on different frequencies. Early 5G smartphones like LG’s V50 ThinQ and the OnePlus Pro 7 5G couldn’t pack in all the necessary frequencies for both carriers so they were sold in two different versions on each carrier. This meant many early Verizon 5G phones wouldn’t work on Sprint and vice-versa.

Meanwhile Apple released its iPhone 11 lineup in 2019 with no 5G support at all. The message from Cupertino was clear: 5G wasn’t a big enough deal yet to warrant its inclusion in Apple’s flagship smartphone lineup.

That’s a fair assessment since Apple builds its products for the masses and 5G was available to less than 5% of U.S. consumers in September 2019. That had changed significantly by the time the iPhone 12 was released a year later and 5G has been standard on every iPhone since with support for every 5G band from T-Mobile’s 600MHz low-band to AT&T’s 39GHz mmWave in every U.S. model save the lower-cost iPhone SE.

T-Mobile takes the lead

By November 2019 Verizon had 5G coverage in small areas of 16 U.S. cities and Sprint claimed around 16 million people under its 5G umbrella.

So it’s easy to appreciate how big of a deal it was when T-Mobile flipped the switch on its nationwide 5G network on December 2 promising 5G service to 200 million people in more than 5000 cities and towns across the U.S. In one fell swoop the carrier had just increased 5G availability tenfold.

While Verizon still offered significantly faster speeds that didn’t matter to 99% of its customers since they were stuck on the carrier’s 4G network. In those early days T-Mobile’s initial 5G network wasn’t much faster than its 4G/LTE network but it also wasted no time making dramatic improvements.

First off T-Mobile worked to build a “standalone” 5G network — one that wouldn’t rely on sharing the airwaves with older 4G/LTE traffic. This allowed it to make the most of its low-band 600MHz 5G spectrum by dedicating towers to carrying only 5G traffic.

In April 2020 T-Mobile also completed its merger with Sprint and quickly began decommissioning the other carrier’s 2.5GHz towers to make room for what would become its 5G Ultra Capacity (5G UC) network. This mid-band 5G spectrum sits in the sweet spot offering the best combination of range and speed and by the end of 2021 T-Mobile had extended this coverage to over 200 million people across the country.

Carving up the airwaves

While T-Mobile was busy at work building out its midrange 2.5GHz network its rivals were left at a disadvantage. Neither AT&T nor Verizon had any mid-band spectrum available to them at that time so they were forced to stay on the low-end.

AT&T continued slowly rolling out its low-band 5G network while deploying a faster 5G Plus (5G+) mmWave network in dense urban areas. While Verizon had started from the opposite end with its 2019 mmWave deployments in late 2020 it switched on its low-band 5G Nationwide network to bring 5G to the majority of its customers.

Unfortunately since these extended 5G networks relied on the same frequencies used by the carriers’ 4G/LTE services customers got little more than the privilege of seeing a 5G symbol appear on their smartphones. Actual download speeds were rarely any better than 4G/LTE and in some cases were slower as 4G/LTE traffic always had priority on those airwaves.

C-band changes the game

T-Mobile’s 2.5GHz spectrum gave it a massive head start on deploying a faster 5G network but the other carriers weren’t about to be left behind. In early 2021 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) put a chunk of C-band spectrum up for auction in the 3.7–3.98GHz range.

Verizon was quick to gobble up as much of that as it could paying a record $45 .4 billion in the auction. AT&T spent $23 billion to secure its piece and T-Mobile dropped $9.3 billion for a smaller portion that would be used to augment its existing 2.5GHz Ultra Capacity network.

However this new spectrum was much more valuable to Verizon and AT&T since it finally let them play in the mid-band club. Better yet these higher frequencies potentially offer even greater capacity than T-Mobile’s 2.5GHz spectrum albeit at slightly shorter ranges.

Following a heated controversy with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the airline industry over whether these signals would interfere with aircraft instruments AT&T and Verizon finally got the green light to switch on their C-band spectrum in January 2022.

Customers saw marked performance improvements right out of the gate. This was especially true for those on Verizon since the carrier immediately rolled out the new C-band spectrum to 100 million people in 1700 cities. By comparison AT&T limited its initial C-band rollouts to only eight urban centers preferring to defer a wider C-band rollout until later this year when it can take advantage of some less controversial 3.45–3.55GHz C-band spectrum it acquired in a later auction.

The 5G landscape today

While T-Mobile still holds a commanding lead this is due mainly to the big head start it had in rolling out its midrange coverage in the first place. A study comparing 5G enhanced services on equal footing shows that T-Mobile and Verizon customers get roughly the same performance when using their carriers’ best 5G networks — the mid-band ones.

However the much broader coverage of T-Mobile’s 5G Ultra Capacity network means more customers will experience its fastest download speeds pushing up the nationwide median compared to Verizon. It’s fair to say these numbers will get more balanced as Verizon expands its 5G Ultra Wideband coverage to more cities.

Similarly AT&T remains in last place as it’s taking a much more measured approach to its 5G rollouts but that will also change once it starts switching on more 5G Plus sites later this year and it should be more of a contender by 2023.

The good news is that this year we’ve moved past most of the challenges from the early days of 5G. Today all three nationwide carriers have mature 5G networks that leverage all three frequency ranges — low-band in rural areas mid-band in most cities and mmWave in dense urban locations — to provide the best possible 5G service. The question is no longer about whether a given carrier provides better 5G service than its rivals — T-Mobile’s 5G UC Verizon’s 5G UW or AT&T’s 5G+ are all neck-in-neck for performance — but simply if those fastest 5G networks are available where you live and work.

Two-minute review

The Fitbit Versa 2 was the company's first true smartwatch and it's stood the test of time well. Even though it's now been superseded by the Fitbit Versa 3 (which has the added benefit of on-board GPS) it's still one of the best Fitbits you can buy and particularly worth considering if you're in the market for a cheap smartwatch.

After the launch of Fitbit’s first smartwatch the Ionic the company struggled to compete with the likes of the Apple Watch and dedicated running watches from Garmin. Then along came the Fitbit Versa and it turned the company’s fortunes around. So it’s no wonder Fitbit quickly followed that up with the Versa 2 and later the Versa 3.

With the Versa 2 Fitbit has again proved that you don’t necessarily need top-notch features to make a terrific fitness watch and it doesn’t need to burn a hole in your wallet.

Fitbit Versa 2: key specs Display: 300 x 300 pixel touchscreen AMOLED

Materials: Aluminum watch case

Connectivity: Bluetooth 4.0 and 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi

Water resistance: Up to 50m

Sensors: 3-axis accelerometer optical heart rate monitor altimeter ambient light sensor vibration motor NFC microphone and relative SpO2 sensor

Battery life: 5 days of standard usage

Unlike most other smartwatches on the market the Versa 2 isn’t looking to replace your phone – in fact you could call it a dumbed-down version of a smartwatch. And that isn’t necessarily a bad thing.

The Versa 2 is squarely aimed at users keen on fitness rather than those seeking productivity from a wearable making it an extension of Fitbit’s excellent fitness tracker range but one that comes with some extra perks.

While health and activity tracking takes center stage the Versa 2 bridges the gap between phone and wrist by offering message and calendar notifications ways to control your smart home setup and play music from your phone while on a run or workout session.

Fitbit has continued to update the Versa 2 with new features ever since its launch in 2019. New features like the Smart Alarm and additional always-on watch faces didn't seem enough for the company so the latest update brings an oxygen level monitor that monitors blood oxygen levels while you sleep.

Launch price of $199 / £199 / AU$329

Special Edition Versa 2 costs $229 / £219.99 / AU$379

Fitbit announced the Versa 2 on August 28 ahead of IFA 2019 where the company showed the device off to the public for the first time. The Versa 2 is available to buy now and you can pick it up from Fitbit's website or from major retailers either in-store or online.

The Fitbit Versa 2 costs £199.99 / $199.95 / AU$329.95 although there is a Special Edition version that retails for $229.95 / £219.99 / AU$379 and comes with either a Mist Grey or Copper Rose chassis and a premium woven band in the box.

At launch the price of the Versa 2 matched that of its predecessor in the US and UK but it’s a tad higher in Australia and is roughly on par with the price of the Apple Watch Series 3 in most regions.

Purchasing a Versa 2 will also get you a seven-day free trial of Fitbit Premium the company’s new subscription fitness service. Those treating themselves to the Special Edition Versa 2 will however get a 90-day free trial of Fitbit Premium (more on this feature later).

Design and display

Retains ‘squircle’ design

New always-on AMOLED display

Single button

Design score: 4/5

When it comes to the design Fibit’s mantra seems to be one of ‘if it ain’t broke don’t fix it’. The ‘squircle’ design of the Apple Watch and the original Versa seems to have been embraced by users and Fitbit has carried that on to the Versa 2. At first glance the new fitness watch does look strikingly similar to its predecessor but closer inspection reveals a few small tweaks giving the Versa 2 a very stylish look indeed.

With a depth of 0.47 inches (12mm) it’s only a tiny bit thicker than the Apple Watch 3 but since the chassis tapers inward toward the heart monitor underneath it actually appears slimmer. And with a screen size of 40mm it should fit most wrists.

The tapered chassis makes it look thinner than it actually is (Image credit: Future)

Thankfully Fitbit has removed its branding from the bottom bezel of the Versa meaning the bezels on the Versa 2 are slightly thinner giving you a tad more screen real estate than before. While the display’s black background is usually quite successful at disguising the bezels they are quite obvious at some angles albeit easy to ignore.

Where the original Versa had three buttons on the chassis – two on the left and one on the right – the Versa 2 sports just a single button on the left and serves as both the ‘select’ and the ‘back’ button. This means you’re never more than a press or two away from the feature you need to access while any other navigation you need to perform is done via the touchscreen.

A single button gives the Versa 2 a more minimalist look (Image credit: Future)

Talking about the screen that’s the one major hardware improvement worth writing home about. Unlike the LCD display on the Versa the second-generation Fitbit smartwatch has steps into the age of the bright AMOLED touchscreen which is protected by Gorilla Glass 3.

It’s capable of hitting upwards of 1000 nits of brightness although we found this to be actually too bright for general use setting our Versa 2 to the lowest brightness setting permanently. Even at a ‘dim’ setting the 300 x 300 resolution screen is crisp and thanks to its ambient light sensor is capable of adjusting brightness according to the environment you’re in.

The always-on display doesn't have too many customization options (Image credit: Future)

Another important feature Fitbit has added to the Versa 2 is an always-on option. By default this option is switched off and you will need to go into the watch’s settings pane to change that selection. At launch there were no customization options for the always-on watch face and until now was limited to a single default analog or digital option. However a new firmware update has now added plenty of third-party always-on faces some of which can be customized. They're available on the companion app although most of them are paid options with only a few free watch faces available.

If you prefer using the always-on display – after all it's nice to be able to see the watch face without having to move your arm – you'll find that it cuts the battery life to about half.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt0bG8uY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMDYvc3RhdGUtY29udGVuZHMtd2FycmFudHMtc2Vla2luZy1ldmlkZW5jZS1pbi1jaGlsZC1wb3JuLWNhc2UtYXJlLXZhbGlkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,State contends warrants seeking evidence in child porn case are valid,"Steven Walski

The state has filed an answer opposing a motion by attorneys for a Mountain Home man facing 99 counts of possessing child pornography to have all evidence in his case thrown out.

The 19-page motion filed by the defense contends the information on the affidavit used to obtain the initial search warrant in Baxter County was deficient in several areas and not valid.

There were several search warrants issued during the investigation that eventually implicated 34-year-old Steven Walski.

The team of defense lawyers claims that since the original warrant was not valid any evidence gathered using warrants issued later in the investigation would be invalid as well.

The state contends warrants issued during the investigation of the case were valid and that evidence was gathered legally and asks the court to dismiss the defense’s motion to quash.

Sheridan attorney Jeremy Lowery told the court recently because “there was no human being on the other side of this tip – just a corporation – that there was no way to determine how the person gathered the information and whether the person was reliable.”

The state contends the private company that first reported the suspect Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) Synchronoss uses an automated system set up to recognize suspected child porn not a single individual.

When suspect material is detected the company’s automated system reports the find to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC).

In answer to the defense’s contention that no one person is identified in the affidavit the state points out “A Synchronoss employee does not view the information or image before it is reported.”

Once the suspect material is sent to NCMEC it is viewed for the purpose of establishing that it does contains CSAM material and a cybertip is generated and sent to local law enforcement.

When the cybertip was received a Mountain Home Police Investigator did review files using a secure access system and confirmed they did meet the criteria for CSAM.

In addition the defense contends there was no information contained in the affidavit to give any picture as to whether or not the data was “stale.”

The state points to several factors that establish the information in the affidavit fell outside any definition of stale.

One factor is that Synchronoss’ detection system works “immediately” to identify material suspected of containing CSAM and to send it on to NCMEC.

The state also points out that the affidavit contains the phrase “there is now being concealed” certain property – evidence of distributing possessing or viewing matter depicting sexually explicit conduct involving a child. The word “now” is sufficient to indicate the information in the affidavit was current and not dated the state contends.

In its answer the state says Walski “agreed to the monitoring” of his stored material when he signed Synchronoss’ terms and conditions.” The private company “did not need probable cause to search his account.”

INVESTIGATION AND ARREST

Walski was arrested in early November last year following an investigation spanning several months.

The investigation was triggered by the tip from Synchronoss a company that offers various services to providers such as Verizon and AT&T sent to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and passed on to law enforcement in Mountain Home.

According to the probable cause affidavit the user later identified as Walski had violated the company’s terms and conditions by manipulating an image containing Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM).

During the investigation it was determined that several downloads of CSAM were allegedly made by and traced to Walski.

According to investigative reports a large majority of the images depicted nude pre-pubescent females engaged in sexual contact with adults or who had been “sexually posed.”

WHAT HAVE COURTS SAID

There have been rulings by a number of courts in different states on this issue.

Most have found that a “private search” for child pornography by corporate entities such as AOL Synchronoss and other providers is not a violation of a persons fourth amendment rights.

As in the Baxter County case the suspect material was identified by the use of electronic tools such as the Image Detection Filtering Process.

Once suspect material is identified companies like Synchronoss are required by federal law to turn it over to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC).

Courts have also fairly consistently held that the providers and NCMEC are not police or agents of law enforcement and not required to have a warrant to check out suspect material being sent or received through their networks.

For more than a century Wall Street has been a wealth-building machine for those who are patient. Over long periods high-quality companies and the indexes they're a part of tend to increase in value.

Something else that's commonplace on Wall Street is change. It's perfectly normal for innovation acquisitions competitive advantages and other factors to shake up the world's largest publicly traded companies on a fairly regular basis.

Just 18 years ago companies like General Electric AIG and Intel were among the 10 largest publicly traded companies by market cap. As of Aug. 4 Intel wasn't even in the top 50 any longer while GE and AIG had fallen out of the top 125 and top 250 respectively. Eight years from now in 2030 the stock market's 10 largest stocks could look vastly different than they do today.

While absolutely nothing is set in stone I predict that the following 10 stocks will have the largest market caps by 2030. Note that these 10 companies aren't listed in any particular order.

1. Berkshire Hathaway

The first stock conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.61%) (BRK.B 0.60%) should retain its spot in the top 10 even if billionaire CEO Warren Buffett isn't at the helm come 2030. After overseeing an average annual return on the company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of 20.1% since 1965 Buffett has clearly shown he's set his company up for long-term success.

One factor that makes Berkshire Hathaway such an incredible company is the mountain of passive income it collects every year. Over the next 12 months Buffett's company is expected to bring in well over $6 billion in dividend income with $4.25 billion coming from just a handful of companies. Because dividend stocks have a long history of outperforming nondividend payers holding these time-tested companies for years or decades provides an added boost.

2. Apple

Perhaps the least-surprising prediction is that the largest publicly traded company in the U.S. Apple (AAPL 1.00%) will remain in the top 10 largest stocks by market cap by 2030.

Aside from an easily recognized brand name and faithful customer base Apple's innovation is key to its success. Introducing a 5G-capable iPhone quickly pushed up its market share in the U.S. while CEO Tim Cook is busy leading a multiyear transition that emphasizes subscription services. Ultimately subscriptions should boost Apple's operating margins and lessen the sales volatility witnessed during product replacement cycles.

Apple has also repurchased $520 billion worth of its own common stock since the beginning of 2013. If this aggressive buyback program continues value investors are likely to continue plowing into Apple.

3. Visa

Payment processor Visa (V 0.49%) currently finds itself on the outside looking in (No. 11). By the turn of the decade I expect it to firmly find itself as one of the 10 largest companies by market cap.

Visa's opportunity for expansion is enormous. Most global transactions are still being conducted in cash which means it can expand organically into underbanked regions such as the Middle East Africa and Southeastern Asia or lean on acquisitions to grow (e.g. the Visa Europe buyout in 2016). Sustained double-digit annual growth should be the expectation throughout the decade.

What's more Visa strictly sticks to payment processing. Although the company would probably do just fine as a lender it would also expose Visa to potential loan delinquencies and losses during recessions. By avoiding lending Visa is able to bounce back from economic downturns faster than its peers and maintain a profit margin above 50%.

4. Alphabet

Another FAANG stock that has an exceptionally high likelihood of retaining its top-10 ranking by market cap come 2030 is Alphabet (GOOGL 0.34%) (GOOG 0.24%) the parent company of internet search engine Google and streaming platform YouTube.

Google has long been Alphabet's foundational operating segment. Over the past two years it's handled no less than 91% of global internet search share a big reason why Alphabet sports such incredible ad-pricing power. As traffic acquisition costs decline over time Google should continue to be a cash cow for the company.

But Alphabet's future is about its higher-growth initiatives like YouTube and Google Cloud. YouTube has grown into the second-most-visited social site in the world while Google Cloud has gobbled up 8% of global cloud infrastructure spending.

5. Salesforce

Cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software provider Salesforce (CRM -1.36%) could make one of the biggest leaps (currently No. 43) in terms of market cap by 2030. CRM software is what's used to help businesses enhance customer relationships and boost sales.

Global CRM software sales are expected to sustain double-digit growth through at least mid-decade which is great news for the industry's unquestioned leader. According to IDC Salesforce commanded a 23.8% share of CRM software spending in 2021 (over four times its next-closest competitor).

In addition to its commanding market share co-CEO and co-founder Marc Benioff has a penchant for making earnings-accretive acquisitions. These deals broaden the Salesforce ecosystem and help with the company's cross-selling opportunities.

6. Amazon

E-commerce stock Amazon (AMZN 0.80%) is another really strong bet to retain its spot in among the 10 largest stocks by the turn of the decade.

Most folks know Amazon for its industry-leading online marketplace. In 2022 eMarketer projects that Amazon will account for 39.5% of all U.S. online retail sales. But the real crown jewel is the more than 200 million Prime members who've signed up as a result of its leading marketplace. The fees collected from Prime members help Amazon expand its logistics network and reinvest in high-growth initiatives.

There's also Amazon Web Services (AWS) which is the global No. 1 in cloud infrastructure spending with 33% market share. Corporate cloud spending is still in its early innings which means Amazon's operating cash flow could skyrocket in the years ahead.

7. PayPal Holdings

The company I predict will make the biggest leap into the top 10 stocks by market cap is fintech giant PayPal Holdings (PYPL 1.00%). PayPal is currently No. 88 with a $112 billion market cap.

Digital payments are still in their infancy which bodes well for fee-based payment platforms. Even with U.S. gross domestic product declining in back-to-back quarters PayPal's total payment volume on its network continues to grow by a double-digit percentage on a constant-currency basis.

Arguably even more important active users are more engaged than ever. At the end of 2020 active users were completing 40.9 transactions over the trailing 12 months (ttm). This figure is up to 48.7 transactions per active account on a ttm basis through June 2022 and it continues to climb.

8. Microsoft

Software kingpin Microsoft (MSFT 0.43%) the only company from the 10 largest stocks by market cap in 1999 to still have a top-10 position today has a good shot at sustaining its dominance throughout the decade.

Microsoft's success is a function of raking in mammoth amounts of cash flow from its legacy operations and funneling this cash into faster-growing projects. For instance even though its high-margin Windows franchise is generally a slow grower it still accounts for a 76% share of global desktop operating systems.

Microsoft is utilizing this cash flow to reinvest in a variety of cloud initiatives -- Azure is the global No. 2 in cloud infrastructure spending and grew sales by 46% on a constant-currency basis in the June-ended quarter -- and fuel acquisitions. For instance Microsoft offered $68.7 billion to acquire gaming company Activision Blizzard in January.

9. Chevron

Despite a feverish renewable energy push by most developed countries I predict oil and gas major Chevron (CVX 1.79%) will find its way into 10 largest publicly traded companies by market cap in 2030.

The biggest reason for this push is the expectation that oil and natural gas prices will remain elevated for many years to come. The pandemic resulted in multiple years of reduced domestic and international drilling and pipeline investment. Couple this with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and you'll see there's a clear risk to global energy supply.

Chevron is also in excellent financial shape compared to most other integrated oil stocks. By prudently deploying its capital and minimizing debt Chevron has been able to maintain its superior dividend repurchase its own stock and fund key natural gas projects in the Asia-Pacific region.

10. Meta Platforms

Lastly social media stock Meta Platforms (META 0.60%) the company formerly known as Facebook should find itself as one of the 10 largest stocks in 2030. You'll note that current top-10 stocks Tesla (TSLA -1.57%) UnitedHealth Group (UNH 0.76%) Nvidia (NVDA -1.84%) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 0.60%) didn't make the cut.

Although social media usage statistics can be extremely fickle to project one year in advance let alone in eight years Meta has four of the most downloaded apps in the world. On a combined basis Facebook Instagram WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger attracted 3.65 billion monthly active users in the June-ended quarter. That's over half the global adult population and a big reason why Facebook's ad-pricing power is exceptionally strong more often than not.

The wild card is the company's metaverse ambitions the ""metaverse"" being the next iteration of the internet that allows connected users to interact with each other and their surroundings in a 3D virtual environment. It will be years before the necessary infrastructure is in place to support the metaverse. But once there Meta's hefty investments could make it a key player in this potentially $30 trillion opportunity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZ2h0ZnVsLmNvbS93cmVzdGxpbmcvdGltb3RoeS10aGF0Y2hlci13aXRoZHJhd24tcHJvLXdyZXN0bGluZy1ub2FoLW4tMS12aWN0b3J5LXRvdXJuYW1lbnQtZHVlLXZpc2EtaXNzdWVz0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZmlnaHRmdWwuY29tL3dyZXN0bGluZy90aW1vdGh5LXRoYXRjaGVyLXdpdGhkcmF3bi1wcm8td3Jlc3RsaW5nLW5vYWgtbi0xLXZpY3RvcnktdG91cm5hbWVudC1kdWUtdmlzYS1pc3N1ZXM_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Timothy Thatcher Withdrawn From Pro Wrestling NOAH N-1 Victory Tournament Due To Visa Issues,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZ2h0ZnVsLmNvbS93cmVzdGxpbmcvdGltb3RoeS10aGF0Y2hlci13aXRoZHJhd24tcHJvLXdyZXN0bGluZy1ub2FoLW4tMS12aWN0b3J5LXRvdXJuYW1lbnQtZHVlLXZpc2EtaXNzdWVz0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZmlnaHRmdWwuY29tL3dyZXN0bGluZy90aW1vdGh5LXRoYXRjaGVyLXdpdGhkcmF3bi1wcm8td3Jlc3RsaW5nLW5vYWgtbi0xLXZpY3RvcnktdG91cm5hbWVudC1kdWUtdmlzYS1pc3N1ZXM_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D82B9BBE0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZ2h0ZnVsLmNvbS93cmVzdGxpbmcvdGltb3RoeS10aGF0Y2hlci13aXRoZHJhd24tcHJvLXdyZXN0bGluZy1ub2FoLW4tMS12aWN0b3J5LXRvdXJuYW1lbnQtZHVlLXZpc2EtaXNzdWVz0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZmlnaHRmdWwuY29tL3dyZXN0bGluZy90aW1vdGh5LXRoYXRjaGVyLXdpdGhkcmF3bi1wcm8td3Jlc3RsaW5nLW5vYWgtbi0xLXZpY3RvcnktdG91cm5hbWVudC1kdWUtdmlzYS1pc3N1ZXM_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy56YXd5YS5jb20vZW4vbGVnYWwvcmVndWxhdGlvbnMvZnJlZWxhbmNlLXdvcmstcGVybWl0cy1pbi11YWUtZXhwbGFpbmVkLWhvdy10by1jb21wbGFpbi1pZi1zYWxhcmllcy1hcmUtZGVsYXllZC1yOXQ1bnF4OdIBiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy56YXd5YS5jb20vZW4vbGVnYWwvcmVndWxhdGlvbnMvZnJlZWxhbmNlLXdvcmstcGVybWl0cy1pbi11YWUtZXhwbGFpbmVkLWhvdy10by1jb21wbGFpbi1pZi1zYWxhcmllcy1hcmUtZGVsYXllZC1yOXQ1bnF4OT9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Freelance work permits in UAE explained: How to complain if salaries are delayed,"Question: I am a freelancer based in the UAE. I understand companies in the country are bound to pay salaries on time as stipulated in employment contracts. How about freelancers like us? Sometimes companies delay paying freelancers like me for weeks or even months. Do we have a complaints mechanism?

Response: Pursuant to your queries we assume that you are employed as a freelancer by a mainland entity in the UAE and you have relevant freelance work permits issued by the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (the ‘MOHRE’). Therefore the provisions of Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021 on the Regulation of Employment Relations (the 'Employment Law') and the Cabinet Resolution No. 1 of 2022 on the Implementation of Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021 Regarding the Regulation of Employment Relations (the 'Cabinet Resolution No. 1 of 2022') are applicable.

The Employment Law includes the freelance work permit as a legal form of work permit in the UAE. The freelance model of work is defined in Article 8 of the Cabinet Resolution No.1 of 2022 which reads as:

1. Freelance is an independent and flexible work arrangement whereby the natural person generates income by providing his services for a specified period of time or performing a task or providing a specific service whether for individuals or establishments whereas this natural person is in no way a worker for those individuals or establishments.

2. The Cabinet shall based on the Minister’s proposal issue the necessary resolutions for determining the procedures rules and mechanisms for registering freelancers in the Ministry’s systems and for obtaining renewing and cancelling the work permit in a manner that ensures the enhancement of labour market flexibility and its requirements.”

Freelance work permit has been specifically mentioned in Article 6(1)(l) of the Cabinet Resolution No. 1 of 2022 and it reads as: “Subject to the provisions of Article (6) of the Decree-Law the types of work permits shall be determined as follows:

Freelance permit: This permit is issued to individuals wishing to undertake independent self-employment without being sponsored by a specific organization or employer in the State and without the condition of having a valid employment contract whereby the natural person earns money by providing his services for a specific period or performing a task or providing a specific service whether to individuals or establishments whereas this natural person is in no way a worker for those individuals or establishments.”

Based on the aforementioned provisions of law your freelance employment in the UAE is within the purview of prevailing Employment Law Cabinet Resolution No. 1 of 2022 and subsequent ministerial decrees if you have the relevant work permit(s) issued by MOHRE for each of the employers with whom you are working on freelance basis.

It is the responsibility of the employer to pay the salary of the employees on time in accordance with Wages Protection System as mentioned in Article 16(1) of the Cabinet Resolution No. 1 of 2022. In the event the employer does not pay the salary of the employees on time then MOHRE may take necessary legal actions against such employer. This is in accordance with Article 16(2) of the Cabinet Resolution No. 1 of 2022.

Therefore as a freelancer if your employer(s) delays in paying your salary you may initiate an employment complaint against your employer with the MOHRE in accordance with the Article 54 of the Employment Law and Article 31 of the Cabinet Resolution No. 1 of 2022.

Tyler was 30 years old a graduate of Dartmouth High School and Bridgewater State University when he took his own life in 2018.

His uncle Joel Baptista said Tyler's smile could light up a room but it was amazing how much that smile could hide.

""We saw some signs and help was provided but sometimes the pain is just too much and people can't see the light at the end of the tunnel"" Baptista said. ""We have a close-knit family but we just didn't know it would come to that.""

Jenelle Hickey is the coordinator of a program at Child and Family Services that assists young people at risk of suicide giving them the help they need to hopefully move forward.

Both Baptista and Hickey joined Townsquare Sunday this week to discuss suicide in our area.

After Tyler's death Baptista said his family decided to form a foundation to assist organizations working with young people on suicide prevention. That organization is Child and Family Services and Janelle Hickey's CBAT unit.

""We work with kids (ages) four to 17 who are in an acute mental health crisis"" Hickey said. ""That might mean depression anxiety or having suicidal thoughts and feelings.""

She said youngsters in the program stay about two weeks while personnel work on getting them to feel better.

CBAT currently has nine beds but it will grow to 15 when the program moves to the former Regal House building on Church Street sometime after the New Year. Hickey said her program is always full and sadly it's not uncommon for people at risk to have to wait for placement.

The Tyler Joseph Leonard Memorial Foundation will hold a fundraiser on September 10 from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. at the Allendale Country Club in Dartmouth. It will feature music dancing a silent auction and much more.

Proceeds from the event will fund a scholarship for a Dartmouth High School student and the CBAT program at Child and Family Services. For information and tickets visit thetylerjosephleonardmemorialfoundation.org.

The U.S. retail industry is in a state of change. Consumers are increasingly shopping online favoring the convenience of delivery rather than taking a trip to a store. Many retailers are struggling to adapt having relied too heavily on malls for traffic. Some retail bankruptcies have already occurred and more are likely to follow as the trend toward Internet retail seems unstoppable.

Making matters even worse for brick-and-mortar retailers is the threat of the coronavirus and the related damage to the economy. Multiple large U.S. cities have been placed on lockdown virtually eliminating foot traffic to retailers. The uncertainty regarding when the coronavirus will end as well as the likelihood of a recession in the U.S. has caused many retail stocks to crash along with the broader stock market over the past several weeks.

With all this in mind we created a downloadable list of retail stocks along with important financial metrics such as price-to-earnings ratios and dividend yields.

But not all retailers are doomed. We still view many retail stocks favorably although investors must be selective and focus on stocks that offer a combination of value growth and/or dividends. Investors must also retain a long-term focus as the short-term will continue to be volatile for the retail industry.

Walgreens Boots Alliance is the largest retail pharmacy in both the United States and Europe. Through its flagship Walgreens business and other business ventures the company employs more than 325000 people and has more than 13000 stores.

On March 31st 2022 Walgreens reported Q2 results for the period ending February 28th 2021. Sales from continuing operations grew 3% over the prior year’s quarter driven by COVID-19 vaccinations and testing. U.S. retail comparable sales grew 15% which is a 20-year high growth rate. Adjusted earnings-per-share grew 26% from $1.26 to $1.59 and exceeded analysts’ consensus by $0.19. The company has beaten analysts’ estimates for 7 consecutive quarters.

Walgreens reiterated its guidance for low-single digit growth of its annual earnings-per-share.

Top Retail Stock #9: Big Lots (BIG)

5-year expected annual returns: 14.1%

Big Lots is a home discount retailer with a focus on closeouts and low prices. With $6 billion in sales and a market cap of around $930 million this S&P 600 component can trace its history to 1967.

Source: Investor Presentation

The company reported Q4 and full year 2021 results on March 3rd 2022 and announced a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share. With 2021 earnings of $5.33 per share and a forward annualized dividend of $1.20 the dividend is well covered by their existing business despite the decrease in earnings since 2020 where they reported $7.35 per share in earnings.

Despite a negative impact of around $0.30 per share as a result of adverse shrink and the issues with the supply chain that characterized 2021 the management team is confident that 2022 will see these issues abate. In 2022 the company plans on opening 50 net new stores more than they have in the past 5 years combined which should provide an opportunity for additional revenue growth.

Big Lots stock has a P/E below 5 making it a deep-value stock. Shares also have a dividend yield of 4.1% while we expect no EPS growth. Total returns are estimated at 14.1% over the next five years.

Top Retail Stock #8: Macy’s Inc. (M)

5-year expected annual returns: 14.3%

Macy’s is a department store company that operates brick and mortar stores as well as online stores under the Macy’s Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury brands. Macy’s was founded in 1929 and is headquartered in Cincinnati Ohio. The company owns highly valuable real estate such as the Herald square building in New York City.

Macy’s reported its fourth quarter earnings results on February 28. The company reported that its revenues totaled $8.7 billion during the quarter which was ahead of forecasts beating the consensus by $220 million. Macy’s revenues were up by 28% versus the previous year’s quarter which had seen a large pandemic impact.

The revenue increase can be explained by the easing impact of the coronavirus pandemic in Macy’s home market the US where economic reopening efforts allowed Macy’s to operate more freely compared to the comparable quarter from the previous year. The steep revenue increase resulted in a major margin improvement compared to the previous year’s quarter which is why the company managed to get its profitability up significantly.

Macy’s is also seeing strong growth due to its transformation into a multi-channel retailer.

Source: Investor Presentation

Macy’s generated earnings-per-share of $2.45 during the fourth quarter which was way better than what the analyst community had expected. 2020 was a weak year for the retailer as was expected due to the large impact the pandemic had on its business model. 2021 was a way stronger year for Macy’s again however. The company earned $5.31 per share on an adjusted basis which was the strongest result in the last decade.

Macy’s stock has a P/E of 4.2 making it a deep-value stock. Shares also have a dividend yield of 2.2% and we expect the company to grow its earnings-per-share by 1% per year. Total returns are estimated at 12.1% over the next five years.

Top Retail Stock #7: Ross Stores (ROST)

5-year expected annual returns: 14.7%

Ross Stores operates 1628 stores with off-price apparel and home fashion in 40 states. It also operates 295 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in 21 states and has a market cap of $33.6 billion. The retailer offers attractive merchandise at a 20%-60% discount compared to the regular prices of department and specialty stores.

In early March Ross Stores reported (3/1/22) financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Management compared the results to those of 2019 which it considers more representative of normal business conditions. Despite a surge in omicron variant cases just before Christmas and waning government fiscal stimulus same-store sales grew 9%.

However earnings-per-share dipped -19% over the 2019 quarter due to higher freight and labor costs as well as COVID related costs. Management raised the dividend by 8.8% but provided lackluster guidance for 2022 expecting earnings-per-share of $4.71-$5.12 mostly due to high inflation.

Ross Stores has recovered from the pandemic and thus it has reinstated its dividend its share repurchases and has resumed its growth plans. It also expects to enhance its market share significantly thanks to the large number of retail bankruptcies caused by the pandemic.

Top Retail Stock #6: Foot Locker (FL)

5-year expected annual returns: 15.0%

Foot Locker is an athletic apparel retailer that operates nearly 3000 stores in 27 countries. Foot Locker should generate about $8.9 billion in revenue this year.

Foot Locker reported fourth quarter and full-year earnings on February 25th 2022 and results were better than expected. However guidance was extremely weak missing estimates widely and the stock declined -30% on the day of the earnings release. Total revenue was $2.34 billion which was up 6.8% year-over-year.

This was due in part to a 0.8% comparable sales increase which was attributable to apparel “significantly” outpacing the core footwear segment. Earnings-per-share came to $1.67 in Q4 which was 21 cents ahead of estimates. For the year earnings came to $7.77 per share a new record by a wide margin.

The company guided for sales to decline by about -5% for 2022 with comparable sales growth of -9%. Square footage is expected to decline fractionally as stores are closed and gross margin is slated for 30.1% to 30.3%. Finally earnings-per-share is guided for $4.25 to $4.60.

The company also boosted its dividend by 33% to $0.40 per share quarterly. In addition the board authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $1.2 billion.

Top Retail Stock #5: Lowe’s Companies (LOW)

5-year expected annual returns: 16.0%

Lowe’s Companies is the second-largest home improvement retailer in the US (after Home Depot). Lowe’s operates or services more than 2200 home improvement and hardware stores in the U.S. and Canada.

Lowe’s reported fourth quarter and full year results on February 23rd . Total sales for the fourth quarter came in at $21.3 billion compared to $20.3 billion in the same quarter a year ago. Comparable sales increased 5% while U.S. home improvement comparable sales increased 5.1%. Net earnings of $1.2billion rose from $978 million in 4Q 2020. Diluted earnings per share of $1.78 was a 35% increase from $1.32 a year earlier.

For the full fiscal year Lowe’s generated diluted EPS of $12.04. The company repurchased 16.3 million shares in 2021 for $13.1 billion. Additionally they paid out $2 billion in dividends. The company remains in a strong liquidity position with $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents.

The company provided a fiscal 2022 outlook and believes they can achieve diluted EPS in the range of $13.10 to $13.60 on total sales of roughly $98 billion. Lowe’s expects to repurchase $12 billion worth of common shares in 2022.

The combination of multiple expansion 6% expected EPS growth and the 1.5% dividend yield lead to total expected returns of 14.3% per year.

Top Retail Stock #4: Target Corporation (TGT)

5-year expected annual returns: 16.1%

Target was founded in 1902 and after a failed bid to expand into Canada has operations solely in the U.S. market. Its business consists of about 1850 big box stores which offer general merchandise and food as well as serving as distribution points for the company’s burgeoning e-commerce business.

Target reported first-quarter results on May 18th. Quarterly revenue of $25.17 billion beat analyst estimates by $688 million but earnings-per-share of $2.19 missed estimates by $0.87. Cost inflation led to the disappointing EPS figure.

We see continued comparable sales growth as driving results along with a small measure of margin expansion and a tailwind from the buyback. Target’s digital efforts are also working extremely nicely and the company’s small-format stores are performing very well opening a new avenue of growth for the company in the coming years. The remaining buyback authorization should be good for a significant tailwind to earnings-per-share in the coming years.

We expect 4% annual EPS growth through 2027. In addition the stock has a current dividend yield of 2.4%. Lastly the stock has a 2022 P/E of 10.4 below our fair value P/E of 18. Total returns are estimated at 16.1% per year over the next five years.

Top Retail Stock #3: Best Buy (BBY)

Gilles Mingasson/Getty Images

Walmart has nixed hundreds of corporate roles.

The company has repeatedly sounded the alarm about inflation and economic uncertainty.

Given Walmart's influence and reach its struggles could indicate industry-wide struggles for retailers.

Walmart made a major splash Monday when it laid off around 200 corporate employees – a move that indicates the retail giant is pivoting to deal with declining profits and an uncertain economic climate.

But it wasn't the first sign of recent trouble for Walmart. From inflation to overstock to over-hiring the world's largest employer has been on its heels throughout 2022 after riding nearly two years of a pandemic high.

""A cut of 200 roles is not material in the context of a giant employer like Walmart"" John Zolidis the president of Quo Vadis Capital told Insider. ""However the action does not send a feel-good message about the business. It also does not suggest a doubling-down on the kind of incremental investment necessary to build capacities and drive growth.""

As the largest brick-and-mortar retailer in the United States Walmart holds significant influence in the industry. It appears that the Arkansas-based retailer is not alone in its current struggles. Big box competitor Target also has announced that it will rely on deep discounting to rid itself of excess inventory loungewear home goods and electronics. And convenience store chain 7-Eleven also recently cut at least 900 corporate jobs.

Here are three factors that have plagued Walmart throughout the year and that preceded the company's layoffs.

Inflation

Earlier in the pandemic inflation proved to be a boon for the big box company. Rising prices across the country pushed shoppers to favor discount and value-focused retailers like Walmart.

Philip Melson client partner at Fractal Analytics told Insider in November 2021 that Walmart ""seems to be confident that it has the scale necessary to absorb inflation well enough to not pass on significant price increases to their customer.""

But prices have continued to climb to a point where Walmart customers are cutting their budgets to the bone focusing only on basic grocery items. The necessity of grocery spending coupled with high gas prices led Walmart customers to avoid spending on general merchandise at the retailer.

""The increasing levels of food and fuel inflation are affecting how customers spend"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement in late July as Walmart cut profit guidance.

Overstock

Higher prices and supply chain issues have forced Walmart to carry far too many products that the company can't sell quickly enough.

After the retail giant reported a 32% increase in inventory at the end of last quarter store-level employees told Insider horror stories from their backrooms – including myriad pallets rendering floors unwalkable towering boxes that have blocked access to private breastfeeding rooms and bathrooms and outdoor trailers stuffed with overstock.

Behind the scenes Walmart corporate has scrambled to deal with this overstock particularly before the holiday season. An internal memo to store managers in late July said that Walmart is allowing stores to turn off their automatic inventory-ordering systems to help mitigate excess inventory.







And as Walmart announced its change in profit guidance the company ordered store managers to clean up bloated inventories through rollbacks and markdowns.

Overstaffing

Other strategic decisions that benefitted the retailer early in the pandemic also proved problematic in 2022.

Like its competitors Walmart undertook a massive hiring push to cover COVID-19-related staffing shortages at the end of 2021. In the company's May earnings call McMillon announced that these ""weeks of overstaffing"" hurt the chain's bottom line.

""As the Omicron variant case count declined rapidly in the first half of the quarter more of our associates that were out on Covid leave came back to work faster than we expected"" he said. ""We hired more associates at the end of last year to cover for those on leave so we ended up with weeks of over-staffing. That issue was resolved during the quarter primarily through attrition.

In the business world at large multiple large companies have flagged ""overstaffing"" as an issue and have embarked on layoffs to correct the issue.

The application provides store-level data actionable analytics and shelf intelligence letting suppliers “plan forecast and optimize product assortment” the company said in a press release. It will also offer customers a more seamless shopping experience aiming to reduce issues caused by out of stock items.

“The deal affirms Walmart’s continued investment in technology and innovation that enables us to better anticipate customer demand” Walmart said in its announcement. “We are acquiring Volt Systems outright including the company talent technology and customer agreements.”

Walmart has been undergoing some other changes lately having recently cut 200 corporate jobs as it plans to refocus its business on new areas.

PYMNTS wrote that the company was “restructuring” its merchandising global tech and real estate teams though it was looking to create new roles in other areas deemed more profitable.

The retailer also recently lowered its sales and earnings forecasts for both the third quarter and the full year as inflation continues to hit record highs and the wider economy faces numerous headwinds.

Walmart tried to remedy the problem by marking down surplus items but as many consumers have been trying to cut back on spending the move didn’t end up helping much. The company was also the most recent blue chip to cut down on payroll as tech giants like Microsoft and Facebook parent Meta are looking at pulling back on their own hirings.

Explore Lebanon sets goals for 2023 as it continues to grow

The Kendall Property Group’s rezoning proposal is for the parcel to accommodate the 248-unit apartment complex as well as some open space and an adjacent space for limited retail.

City Planner Greg Orosz said approximately 2.5 acres of the site are proposed for retail use near Walmart however there is no specific end-user at this time. The 248 dwelling units on 35.852 acres equates to 6.91 units per acre. The units are divided into 16 three-story buildings. There are 339 surface parking spots and 100 attached garages providing 1.77 spaces per dwelling unit.

Orosz said more than 50 percent of the development area is dedicated to open space recreational use and parkland. This includes a 10-acre park that is proposed to be owned and operated as a public park. There will be eight- acres of open space maintained by Home Owners Association. This open space includes buffer areas entrance landscaping a retention pond and a pool house and pool.

The Lebanon Planning Commission held a public hearing on the project on June 21 and unanimously recommended approval of the zoning map amendment and concept plan for the project. City Council will give the final approval to move forward on the project.

The project conforms with the city’s comprehensive plan officials said.

Tim Foster the developer’s engineer said they are working on identifying traffic issues during a discussion at council’s recent work session. He said U.S. 42 may need another traffic lane or a traffic light to address those issues. City Manager Scott Brunka said a traffic study will be needed as the project moves forward.

Councilman Mike Cope said he liked the proposal presented at the work session while Councilman Scott Norris was concerned about “creating a traffic nightmare” in the busy corridor north of the U.S. 42 and Bypass Ohio 48 intersection.

Data shows that the current sentiment on Main Street is pessimistic. The latest CNBC|SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey for Q3 2022 showed that small business confidence hit an all-time low with the largest percentage of small businesses citing inflation as their biggest risk.

""As a small business owner on a tight budget ... you don't even need the really heavy duty AI which I think a lot of small business owners they get a little bit nervous. ... You can actually make a lot of gains with really simple solutions"" Sanders said ""When you're a small business you have an end-to-end control that a large business doesn't have. I see this as a really big opportunity"" she added.

""What I'm seeing with the big companies they're trying to hire futurists and trying to figure out ways to actually predict demand. But every time we look at the numbers the Consumer Price Index all of it we're looking backwards"" Sanders said. ""The fact of the matter is we're in a very quickly changing landscape and I think we have to look forward. Small business owners really need to connect and use judgment to forecast and to understand what their customers need.""

Whether a small business is B2B or B2C Sanders said direct communication is a ""real answer"" for them right now in dealing with changing consumer behavior.

This gives small business owners who can connect directly with customers to understand what their needs are a potential advantage that can't be calculated by an algorithm.

Her opinion is that the biggest companies have become too reliant on inventory algorithms to forecast data but in the current economy which has defied many historical patterns ""historical data in this space right now isn't really good data. It's not clean data it doesn't indicate the future that is very volatile"" she said.

""The big companies are really struggling with that"" Sanders who is an academic expert on forecasting said. ""We see it obviously with the retailers. Walmart Target.""

She cites three areas where entrepreneurs should be focused and the first is directly related to the big box retailer woes: forecasting.

That's the advice from Nada Sanders Northeastern University distinguished professor of supply chain management. She told CNBC's Small Business Playbook virtual summit on Wednesday that she has been ""gloom and doom"" in the past but is now optimistic about Main Street's chances in the current economy.

The inventory builds and subsequent markdowns from the biggest retailers including Walmart and Target show that even the best can get this consumer economy wrong. In fact small business owners being closer to relationships on both the supply and customer ends may be able to more nimbly manage a fast-changing environment.

The retail battle narrative over the past few decades has cited one of two wars: Amazon and e-commerce against the big bricks-and-mortar retailers and everybody big against small Main Street entrepreneurs. But in the current confusing economic environment — marked by inflation supply chain bottlenecks and a volatile consumer changing spending patterns due to the high prices which followed Covid — small business experts say that Main Street should be more optimistic about the advantages of being small.

In the Q3 survey an increasing percentage of small businesses forecast a sales decline over the next 12 months as the economy in their view is already in a recession. The downbeat sales outlook was the biggest contributor to the all-time low in confidence being hit. And as small businesses face higher costs in inputs labor transportation and energy few (only 13%) say now is a good time to pass along price increases to customers according to the survey.

How to set pricing during inflation

But pricing is also an area where small businesses can effectively and directly communicate with their customers and find solutions.

Jeffrey Robinson Rutgers Business School provost and executive vice-chancellor and co-founder of the Center for Urban Entrepreneurship and Economic Development said at the Small Business Playbook virtual summit that one big mistake business owners make is to not figure out pricing on new products until it is too late. At a time of high inflation entrepreneurs need to be basing any pricing of new items on a detailed analysis of the costs that go into producing it. A traditional way that businesses set pricing — decide on the product and then once it is available look at what competitors are charging — is not the way to operate in this economy. Inflation requires that small business owners set price by first and foremost understanding their costs.

""All those prices along the supply chain have gone up"" Robinson said. ""The shipping costs ... anything that has any component of transportation involved those costs have gone up. So assessing and valuing your product or service that you're providing along those costs before you set the price allows you to set the price at the right level"" he said.

And then comes the hard part: explaining it to the customer. Robinson says the direct relationship that small businesses have with their customers should be seen as an advantage too.

""We have relationships. Talk"" he said. ""Explore. You've got to explain to them that the costs have gone up for these components. 'In order for me to do this I have to change some pricing'"" he said.

Helping customers understand the situation that a business is in related to supply chain inflation is going to help set prices in an appropriate way he said. In the end Robinson said it is really no different than a restaurant that has always shown the price of a fish on the menu to be ""market price."" That may be a simplified example but it has reverberated in the current situation.

Some restaurants have put signs out front during the current inflationary period to be transparent with customers about pricing changes. Robinson didn't weigh in on that method specifically but did say every business needs to have some form of conversation with customers and potential customers about the fact that the prices of two years ago are not going to be the prices of today. While the survey data shows that small business owners are wary of this conversation Robinson said they shouldn't be.

""I believe a lot of consumers understand that especially if you're a business-to-consumer type of business"" he said. ""It's about being transparent ... helping people understand that pricing is changing.""

Map out the supply chain with key vendors

The conversation with suppliers is no less important and Sanders said the data shows that on average 80% of a company's spend goes towards about 6% of their suppliers. Those are the business partners to focus on and where to pick up the phone and call and build a relationship. ""As a small company this is really what it's going to be about"" Sanders said. ""What I think you need to do as a small company is really be able to map your supply chain for your key items talk to your vendors really build partnerships"" she said.

Most big companies don't have great visibility below their tier one suppliers according to Sanders so many items become harder to track that are far back in the supply chain ""tier four tier five"" she said.

A small business can map out its supply chain and work with partners to visualize the entire chain and identify the risks. Right now the inventory issues in retail might make small business owners more reluctant to stock up — even though it is the start of peak shopping season with back-to-school and then the holidays. Sanders said she is firm believer in running a ""lean"" operation but in the current economy ""we need to implement some caveats to the meaning of lean.""

In certain cases small businesses are going to have to store extra items critical items with longer lead times and where there are expected price increases. All businesses should also be taking a look at their production processes and whether alternatives exist that could lead to more cost-effective operations. Carrying extra inventories ""flies in the face of lean"" she said but she added ""the advantage for a small business is really being able to manage at the same time upstream and downstream and coordinate those.""

The biggest problem in the current economy is the mismatch between demand supply and that's where Sanders comes back to the issues Walmart and Target have faced and why small businesses should take an opportunistic view of the situation and be proactive about conversations on both the supply side and end customer side of their operations.

""Large companies are dinosaurs. ... They're very heavy bureaucratic. As a small business you're very limber"" she said.

The key for small business owners is to not only look one way either downstream (customer) or upstream (supplier). ""But look at those at the same time really marry those watch them and connect with customers connect with all the vendors"" Sanders said. ""Large companies can't do that. They're stuck because they have huge silos. As a small business you don't have that so leverage that right now."""

The term “Disney Adult” typically refers to a childless adult who loves Disney films the Disney Parks Disney Cruise Line and Disney merchandise.

Though many like to take shots at this group Walt Disney himself said that the Disney Parks were for everyone.

“To all who come to this happy place: Welcome. Disneyland is your land. Here age relives fond memories of the past… and here youth may savor the challenge and promise of the future. Disneyland is dedicated to the ideals the dreams and the hard facts that have created America… with the hope that it will be a source of joy and inspiration to all the world.” – Walt Disney.

Now a viral video has surfaced with more comments from Disney himself addressing the “Disney adult.”

User @donaldclarence shared the video on TikTok.

Walt Disney discussing Disney adults in 1963. #waltdisney #disneyland #disneyhistory #disneyadult

In the video Disney shares that the ratio of adults to children visiting Disneyland is 4 to 1. He also shares that “during the winter time and during many weekdays” you don’t see any children at all.

Disney himself made sure to make it a point to let everyone know they are welcome when visiting the Disney Park which has since expanded to many Parks around the world including Walt Disney World Resort Disneyland Resort Disneyland Paris Tokyo Disneyland Shanghai Disneyland and Hong Kong Disneyland.

So whether you’re an infant age 99 or anywhere in between and no matter your background enjoy Disney World and Disneyland. Haunted Mansion Jungle Cruise Pirates of the Caribbean “it’s a small world” Space Mountain and many others were made for you.

What do you think of Walt Disney’s comments about Disney adults?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdGhhdHBhcmtwbGFjZS5jb20vcnVtb3ItZGlzbmV5LW1heS1icmluZy1iYWNrLXRoZS1tYWluLXN0cmVldC10aGVhdGVyLWV4cGFuc2lvbi1idXQtYmlnZ2VyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rumor: Disney May Bring Back the Main Street Theater Expansion but BIGGER,"The Walt Disney Company may be realizing that a Splash Mountain redo won’t be enough to slow down Epic Universe. Is more on the way?

In the last year I’ve been talking about the sometimes disconcerted plans for Walt Disney World going forward. These rumored options for increasing capacity especially at Magic Kingdom are important given that every effort Disney has made to draw crowds away from Magic Kingdom seem to rarely succeed. People genuinely love the castle park concept with Walt’s original idea for a hub design. It just works. Sure Epcot will be wonderful when it is finishes and Animal Kingdom is a masterclass in design but people continue to want to flock to the park that is synonymous with Disney World.

To that end I’ve talked about a very secret plan at Disney that may look to expand Adventureland and connect it with a very luxurious hotel and spa with private entrance to MK. I’ve also touched on a ten-year plan to bring back the Main Street secondary street development with the old theater plan involved. According to two sources that development though modified is back on the table in a big way as Disney grapples with serious competition in Orlando coming from the Epic Universe theme park set for 2025. Though Disney is behind in terms of having anything ready for Epic Universe I’m told that internal polling and temperature checks have determined that the Splash Mountain removal for Tiana’s Bayou Adventure is no longer expected to be a major boost for the park — they’re having to shut down comments and selectively create promotional material because this is now generally a less-than-popular change.

First the Main Street theater is not dead. It may be heavily modified but the previously shelved concept is high on the list of things to get done over the next ten years. The reason is simple and logistical. For Magic Kingdom to increase capacity they need to alleviate the bottleneck through Main Street USA at the end of the day. Allowing in even more people can create a dangerous situation. The secondary street through previous backstage areas is there but it lacks quite a bit in appearance. More importantly because it is only used at specific times many guests don’t know about it and it doesn’t get its intended job done. The thinking is that a theater (plus museum attachment) and addition of the pathway on the official map would solve the problem. Speaking of the museum the most likely change here is that I’m hearing the theater would likely have a wrap-around museum in which One Man’s Dream is moved into the space. — Walt Disney World Expansions Likely on the Way

Unfortunately because I’m told Disney is in “chase mode” at this point as they realize the formidable challenge Epic Universe will present there are still plenty of variables in design. And also as a result while we may get some sort of announcement at D23 it could also be pushed back until the next year. That would leave this year’s D23 for Disney World as a potpourri of previously-cancelled ride improvements (from before the pandemic) along with Tiana’s Bayou Adventure and a Dinoland fix. One bit of very good news is that I’m told the Story Matters Group that was “modernizing” Disney Parks and making them more “relevant” has not been terribly active as of late… likely as a result of top-down pressure to stop. A number of changes they implemented for social causes over the last year were poorly conceived executed worse and not well-received. Maybe the worst was taking out the historic items from the American Adventure rotunda only to replace them with cheap cartoon posters about jazz. I want African American representation in the parks — I don’t want it to be a cheap and lackluster replacement to important pieces. I think most others feel the same.

So what is on the way based on what I’m hearing?

First it seems that One Man’s Dream is indeed going to be leaving Hollywood Studios at some point in the future should these efforts go ahead. The current iteration I’m told features putting the museum in Magic Kingdom behind new facades that would extend from the Tomorrowland Terrace exit down to the future theater. I’m also told that the theater will be elevated so that guests enter onto the second floor. This will permit a parking garage to exist on the main level with backstage access. I’m also told that the budget for the theater may be significantly increased beyond its original incarnation. That was a shock to me but I’m told Bob Chapek and Josh D’Amaro need something(s) in the next few years to really wow the world and stay ahead (or at least even) of Epic Universe.

All of this may be tied into a secret set of projects to increase the capacity of Magic Kingdom through expansions that feature additional walkway capacity and infrastructure additions. I hear the word “moonbeam” is bandied about a bit.

Other additions to this new theater space could include two new retail spaces a DVC lounge and an outdoor play area for children. Again none of this is finalized according to my sources but I do expect based on their details that this will be a major addition to Magic Kingdom when it does come into fruition. As for what might go into the theater that can change given its properties. However one source said that conceptual work they have seen has led them to believe it might be akin to a much more grand Mickey Mouse Revue.

Discovery's culling?,"Corporate megamergers do not usually concern the average person. Companies devour each other on the regular and most of us are none the wiser about the fallout such events produce until the products or services you assumed would always be there for you suddenly vanish without explanation become more expensive or decrease in quality.

When this happens to tangible goods we may mourn for a moment before reaching for something else and getting on with life. But there are no one-to-one replacements for or favorite TV shows or movies we may have been anticipating which is why the Warner Bros. Discovery shakeups have received so much attention.

Last Tuesday's revelation that the company scrapped ""Batgirl"" was particularly shocking. That movie was set to introduce ""In the Heights"" star Leslie Grace to the DC Extended Universe alongside Brendan Fraser as Batgirl's adversary Firefly with Michael Keaton returning to play an older Bruce Wayne.

But shortly after San Diego Comic-Con attendees noticed the title wasn't included in DC's upcoming releases slate the company announced it would never see the light of day reportedly preferring to recuperate its $90 million cost as a tax write-off.

The unceremonious vaulting of ""Batgirl"" is only the latest and most public example of the bloodletting in progress at Warner Bros. Discovery. And if you watch TV chances are that if the merger hasn't already impacted your watch list it will at some point soon.

What does all of this mean for your favorite HBO Max shows? Nobody can answer that right now with absolute certainty but we can make a few educated (and hopeful ) guesses. Critical and award jury favorites like ""Hacks"" and ""Julia"" are probably safe. On Twitter ""Peacemaker"" creator James Gunn reassured fans that John Cena's hero isn't going anywhere.

What about other highly championed series that people are still discovering such as ""Our Flag Means Death"" or ""Made For Love""? Who knows. The only safe bets in this stable right now star dragons.

It's a lot to wrap our heads and hands around -- too much truly to cover in one place. But to provide a smidgen of context here's a basic overview of what's going on and what to expect.

The top-down view

Parental Guidance with Anderson Cooper (Photo courtesy of Warner Media/CNN+)Few corporate marriages have fueled as many anxious headlines as the new union between what used to be Discovery Inc. and Warner Bros. which was completed in April. The former is known as the home of Shark Week and the ""90 Day Fiancé"" brand of mental Novocaine. The latter produces every DC-related comic book title that you can think of in addition to owning HBO Max home to HBO's library of industry award magnets that debut first on cable (Sunday shows like ""Succession"" ""Westworld"") along with its own slate of streaming originals (""Hacks"" ""The Flight Attendant"" etc).

What does all of this mean for your favorite HBO Max shows? Nobody can say answer that with absolute certainty.

These are the brands and just a couple of the titles that come to mind when glancing at the company's new name. But what most people may not know is that this newly blended family also includes – on the Discovery side – Food Network TLC Investigation Discovery Travel Channel MotorTrend Animal Planet Science Channel OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network and Chip and Joanna Gaines' Magnolia Network which still holds that new car smell. Meanwhile Warner Bros. already absorbed what was once the Turner Broadcasting brands including Cartoon Network CNN TNT TBS and TruTV.

Put all of this together and you have an unwieldy media behemoth bent on dominating movie cable and streaming. HBO Max was already in great shape before all of this. Sometime in 2023 HBO Max will combine its vast library with everything that's on Discovery+ on a yet-to-be-named streaming service. Right now each HBO Max and Discovery+ reach 92 million subscribers worldwide.

However newly anointed Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav isn't marveling at that opportunity. He's reacting to the company's $53 billion in gross debt and has unsheathed his machete and blowtorch. Days after the merger became official Zaslav snuffed out CNN's streaming news network CNN+ in its crib. On April 29 he went on to disintegrate most of the Warner Bros. Discovery-produced Arrowverse shows that aired on The CW including the much-loved ""Legends of Tomorrow.""

Whatever streamer that emerges from the wreckage this clumsy kaiju creates by stomping all over Hollywood's creative community still needs to add 40 million subscribers to break even and that's unlikely to happen any time before 2024 or 2025.

The vanished

At Home With Amy Sedaris (Photograph by Phil Caruso/TruTV/WarnerMedia)There are two things to know about Zaslav: One he was never a fan of his predecessor's pandemic gamble of streaming theatrical releases on HBO Max or producing movies expressly for the service to build its subscriber base. Two he's a fan of reality programming – although in a recent quarterly earnings call Zaslav offered nothing but praise for chief content officer Casey Bloys' stewardship of HBO and HBO Max's series development.

Hence it's not entirely shocking that in addition to the burials of ""Batgirl"" which was in post-production and a planned sequel to the animated movie ""Scoob!"" several made-for-HBO Max movies have already disappeared from HBO Max including ""Charm City Kings"" ""An American Pickle"" ""The Witches"" ""Moonshot"" ""Superintelligence"" and ""Locked Down."" The LeBron James-produced remake of ""House Party"" was supposed to premiere a little over a week ago but that's also been benched.

Maybe you never planned to watch any of these movies or may be comforted to know you can rent them via video on demand. But HBO Max subscribers may have been counting on discovering these along with newer shows and past examples of a favorite creator's or performer's work without paying an extra fee.

The quiet disappearances of several HBO-branded shows from the service mean that's no longer a given.

Alexa Woo Nasim Pedrad and Jake Ryan in ""Chad"" (Liane Hentscher/TBS)So far the list of HBO's departed includes ""Vinyl"" which was co-executive produced by Mick Jagger and Martin Scorsese; ""Here and Now"" from ""True Blood"" creator Alan Ball; Lena Dunham's ""Camping""; Steven Soderbergh's and George Clooney's ""K Street""; ""Mrs. Fletcher"" buoyed by Kathryn Hahn's critically acclaimed performance; and ""Run.""

It doesn't end there. Cult gems such as ""At Home with Amy Sedaris"" and ""Chad"" are gone too. Their defenestration follows the cancellations of their basic cable siblings including TNT's ""Snowpiercer"" and TBS' ""Full Frontal with Samantha Bee.""

The endangered

Harley Quinn (Courtesy of HBO Max)Zaslav was unequivocal regarding his disdain for his predecessor's straight-to-streaming movie model. As for how he sees the value of HBO Max's originals (i.e. its TV shows) that's tougher to deduce.

According to several industry trade reports the series and movies targeted for culling weren't popular with HBO Max subscribers but came out recently enough to qualify for a tax write-down. (Ask your accountant to explain amortization.)

The new Warner Bros. Discovery regime has demonstrated a willingness to shelve finished or nearly finished projects to save a little cash.

Those listed above are merely the missing that regular viewers have noticed so far. More disappearances are coming.

But this also means that existing shows deemed to be under-performers probably won't get additional seasons which may not bode well for critically beloved DC titles such as ""Harley Quinn"" or ""Doom Patrol"" which also features Brendan Fraser. (That's right Zaslav is negatively impacting the Brendan Fraser Renaissance. For shame!)

Matt Bomer Brendan Fraser Joivan Wade Dianne Guerrero on ""Doom Patrol"" (Photograph by Bob Mahoney/HBO Max)During Thursday's quarterly earnings call Zaslav also alluded to emulating Marvel's model to revive the DC TV and movies brand mentioning Batman Superman and Wonder Woman as its core titles.

""Harley Quinn"" is directly connected to the Batman brand as well as ""Suicide Squad"" so there may be hope for it. Plus its third season recently debuted on HBO Max. ""Doom Patrol"" is more of an edge-case title that mainly connects to the Justice League via Cyborg. The good news is that production on the fourth season began in February.

Then again the new Warner Bros. Discovery regime has demonstrated a willingness to shelve finished or nearly finished projects to save a little cash. Hopefully that financially motivated ruthlessness doesn't extend to established shows. But don't hold your breath.

The bottom line

Chip and Joanna Gaines in ""Fixer Upper: Welcome Home"" (Magnolia Network)

There are plenty of numbers to parse related to ratings and revenue but we're still in the early days of Warner Bros. Discovery. Nobody can say with any authority how it will look a few months from now let alone in a year.

What we've seen so far however is concerning. Mergers always result in significant job losses and according to early reports an estimated 70% of the streaming service's development team was (is?) set to be laid off joining the scores of personnel that have already been shown the door.

""Our strategy is to embrace and support and drive the incredible success that HBO Max is having"" Zaslav said. ""It's at a very unique moment. We think it's an extraordinary asset. It's an extraordinary advantage. I've said this before: it's not how much it's how good."" Which provides no concrete assurances that those layoffs aren't coming.

Regardless of that or the swirl and blending of two massive content oceans there's no getting away from the probability that the amount of inclusive content and diversely staffed productions will decrease. As an example a recent press release touting Magnolia Network's impending addition to HBO Max promises a selecting of ""curated"" content listing a few titles planned for the line-up. ""Homegrown"" one of the few Magnolia titles featuring a non-white host was not among them.

A representative from the network told Salon that additional titles would be confirmed closer to the launch of Magnolia's spotlight page. That doesn't soothe my worries.

One person's curation is another's culling and the Warner Bros. Discovery house cleaning exemplifies this. Though the libraries will be expansive once the content deck is finally shuffled in the short term the result will be fewer creative scripted swings. Expect that along with an uptick of reruns and game shows on basic cable channels that once boasted vibrant original prime time slates. The merger may have expanded the media corporation's reach but brace yourself. When one company controls this many streams your viewing options will almost certainly narrow in fundamentally important ways.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vZW4uYXMuY29tL2xhdGVzdF9uZXdzL3doYXQtZG9lcy13YXJuZXItYnJvcy1kaXNjb3ZlcnlzLTM0Mi1iaWxsaW9uLXNlY29uZC1xdWFydGVyLWxvc3MtbWVhbi1mb3ItaXRzLWhiby1tYXgtcGxhdGZvcm0tbi_SAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly9lbi5hcy5jb20vbGF0ZXN0X25ld3Mvd2hhdC1kb2VzLXdhcm5lci1icm9zLWRpc2NvdmVyeXMtMzQyLWJpbGxpb24tc2Vjb25kLXF1YXJ0ZXItbG9zcy1tZWFuLWZvci1pdHMtaGJvLW1heC1wbGF0Zm9ybS1uLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What does Warner Bros. Discovery’s $3.42 billion second quarter loss mean for its HBO Max platform?,"Movie lovers are growing worried after details of the Warner Brothers and Discovery merger begin to trickle out. The merger became official in April 2022 and changes are already rippling across the former Warner Brothers corporate landscape.

On an investor call last week those tuning in heard HBO Max would be dissolved into Discovery+ and converted into a new streaming service that caters to a broader audience. HBO Max fans have until mid-2023 to take advantage of their collection of Warner Brother’s classic archive.

Many who followed the Fox Studios and Disney merger are concerned about what will happen to many of the classic Warner Brothers films as those of Fox are not as readily available on Disney+.

This is not the first time Warner Brothers has merged or been taken over by another company. In 2014 when the WB’s parent company Time Warner acquired AT&T the two were re-named Warner Media. Now Warner Media has been sold by AT&T to allow for its merger with Discovery Inc.

What shows and films are produced and distributed by Discovery Inc.?

Discovery Inc. has its own complicated history. The company began as a single network: Discovery Channel which led to various spinoff networks including Discovery Kids Discovery Travel & Living Discovery Civilization and Science Channel. The company later acquired TLC HGTV Animal Planet and more than a dozen others.

In 2021 Discovery announced it would merge with Warner Media if legally allowed. Some concerns were raised about further consideration of the US media industry but the federal government allowed the merger.

The new name for the company will be Warner Bros. Discovery but the name of the streaming service has yet to be released. What we do know is that HBO Max as its current subscribers currently know it will be removed from the market.

During the quarterly call with investors last week DC universe lovers rejoiced when hearing that the new company will create a studio to focus on DC superhero movies –similar to that which produces the film for the Marvel universe franchise.

However some fans were extremely disappointed to learn that the new Batgirl movie that was already being filmed was cancelled by Warner Brothers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4L3dhcm5lci1icm9zLWRpc2NvdmVyeS1kYXZpZC16YXNsYXYtYmF0Z2lybC1kYy1qai1hYnJhbXMtd2FsdGVyLWhhbWFkYS1taWtlLWRlbHVjYS1wYW0tYWJkeS0xMjM1MDg2OTI4L9IBhwFodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4L3dhcm5lci1icm9zLWRpc2NvdmVyeS1kYXZpZC16YXNsYXYtYmF0Z2lybC1kYy1qai1hYnJhbXMtd2FsdGVyLWhhbWFkYS1taWtlLWRlbHVjYS1wYW0tYWJkeS0xMjM1MDg2OTI4L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Dish: Amid Layoffs How David Zaslav Might Deal With J.J.

Discovery deals work?,"Merging is always the easy part. The companies are usually willing to join ­forces. Bankers and lawyers are incentivized to get the deal done. Plus the media loves a good M&A deal with photo ops of high-fiving CEOs and their grand plans to make history through the process of creative destruction.

But then comes the heavy lifting: Successfully combining two often very different companies with different corporate cultures and creating shareholder value. I’ve been around this business long enough to know that there’s lots of destruction in big-time M&A.

Deals crash and burn at least as much as they pan out maybe more. And what a racket it is for Wall Street which gets paid even when their work ultimately produces failure on a monumental scale. David Zaslav’s Warner Bros. Discovery might be the next one to fail for reasons that will soon become apparent.

Consider the once mighty GE a conglomerate built on theories about how bigger is better. Until it became crystal clear the conglomerate wasn’t living up to its hype and needed to be broken up as shares fell to near penny-stock territory. The bankers who constructed those ugly acquisitions still haven’t spent all the fees they generated on their ill-fated dealmaking.

Then there are the travails of Citigroup. The 1998 mega-deal merged the Travelers Group investment bank and insurance giant with commercial-banking icon Citicorp. It was based on the premise that a financial colossus could make money cross-selling investments and traditional banking products to large institutions and individuals.

Zaslav is looking for $3 billion in post-deal savings this year. SOPA Images/LightRocket via Gett

In retrospect: Not really. The cultures of the businesses never quite meshed. (Banking king Jamie Dimon was even ousted in the chaos.) The cross-selling “synergies” as bankers call them didn’t really materialize either at least not enough to make up for all the bad stuff.

Citigroup is still with us but only because of the generosity of the federal government and the American taxpayer: It was one of the most bailed-out banks during the 2008 financial crisis.

Mother of all fiascos

Now go back in your history books and look up the AOL Time Warner merger fiasco. For my money there is probably no greater example of the destruction of shareholder value built upon a mountain of banking fees and failed promises of synergistic coupling than this dumbo combo.

The $165 billion deal was announced with much fanfare in January 2000. It featured high-fiving CEOs and promises to set the world on fire by cross-selling old media (Time Warner’s magazines cable programs CNN HBO etc.) with new media (AOL’s then-popular Internet portal).

That sounded good amid the irrational exuberance of the online bubble. When the bubble popped so did the company’s value proposition. Then came the great ­unwinding of the company’s various assets.

What was left Time Warner — comprised of HBO CNN Warner Bros. Studios TNT and Turner Sports — was defenestrated in 2016 as well.

The latest sucker AT&T bought the company for $85.4 billion promising shareholders they would make the numbers work by using AT&T’s mobile and broadband distribution to sell Time Warner’s programming (more synergies).

But the telecom geeks at AT&T really never liked the entertainment types at Time Warner (and certainly didn’t understand the business). With shares getting crushed and costs rising they turned to Wall Street once again unloading Warner to Zaslav’s Discovery Inc. to create a new media behemoth Warner Bros. Discovery.

The “Batgirl” movie was canceled before it ever was released for streaming in an attempt to save money. CREDIT: LESLIE GRACE/INSTAGRAM

The deal would finally (hopefully) capture those elusive synergies since Zaslav knows how to make various media properties in this case scripted and unscripted content — HBOs “Game of Thrones” and Discovery’s Food Network — work as one. Warner Bros. Discovery was also born with the size and scale to compete with Disney and Netflix in the streaming wars shareholders were told.

Even so with size comes lots of debt that needs to be slashed. There’s $55 billion worth sitting on Zaslav’s financial statements like a pile of bad scripts. Competition is fierce over its streaming strategy — the alleged future of programming that isn’t making as much money as insiders hope.

And yes those synergies have been hard to find since Zas — as he’s known in media circles — formally took over the new company earlier this year. That is why his stock has been cratering. Warner Bros. Discovery last week announced a $3.41 billion second-quarter loss.

Swinging a heavy ax

Zaslav is looking for $3 billion in post-deal savings. First to go was the CNN+ streaming service as these pages reported. A big-budget likely flop “Batgirl” a woke reset of the DC superhero series was canceled before it could lose Zas even more money than the tens of millions already spent. As I was first to report last week he’s merging his streaming platforms HBO Max and Discovery+. Layoffs will follow.

Of course it’s too early to put Warner Bros. Discovery in the same bucket as AOL Time Warner and the rest of the failures mentioned above. And it’s hard not to root for Zas — he’s one of the few honest guys also good at his job in this lousy business.

And who knows? Maybe his streaming business might soon pick up. Suffice to say the company’s bankers couldn’t care less because they will make money ­either way."

Anastasia Elias is an associate dean of research and professor of chemical and materials engineering at the University of Alberta.

Plastics get a bad rap. We have all seen pictures of plastic bags stuck to turtles or piles of plastic waste strewn across a beach. A few years ago I visited an exhibit at the Vancouver Aquarium featuring plastic waste that author and artist Douglas Coupland had collected from the shores of Haida Gwaii. Small found objects – including toothbrushes pens and empty tubes – lined the walls of the exhibit while larger items bobbed in a 50000-litre tub of water in the centre of the room. After touring the exhibit I sat down with my family to eat lunch in the cafeteria – salad in a plastic container with a label indicating that the plastic was in fact biodegradable. It seemed like a good compromise on the surface but as an engineer it raised a question for me: Is biodegradable plastic really a help to the environment?

Plastics have improved our quality of life immeasurably. They help our food stay fresher longer and transporting food products and other goods wrapped in lightweight plastics rather than heavier materials can reduce not only shipping costs but also the associated CO2 emissions. Plastics also keep things clean while being cheap to produce and convenient for use. In a way they are just too good – since only around 9 per cent of plastics are actually recycled we are amassing piles of plastic waste.

To address this problem Canada recently announced a ban on single-use plastics which gradually comes into effect in December. Ideally this policy would work to drastically reduce the prevalence of single-use plastics – which is something we should strive for – but practically speaking this is difficult to achieve. Engineers have wondered how we can capture the convenience of plastics with alternative materials that won’t leave the same mark on the environment – one candidate is compostable plastic which breaks down at the end of its lifetime. It’s an enticing vision: You could still order a smoothie in an “eco-friendly” to-go cup and then toss the cup in the compost after use where oxygen-breathing (aerobic) bacteria will break the cup down into nutrient-rich soil and CO­2.

There is a problem though: Your cup may be labelled “compostable” but unfortunately you can’t just toss it into any compost bin. In both Canada and the United States in order to meet the requirements to label a material as compostable it must degrade within a certain amount of time in industrial composting conditions. However most industrial composting facilities (including those across Canada) don’t even accept compostable plastics; they prefer lawn clippings and food waste which break down more quickly and – unlike compostable plastics – don’t need to be shredded first. Moreover for workers in these facilities screening out plastics would be more challenging if some plastics are allowed but not others. This is the reason that most compostable materials simply end up in landfills where like food waste paper and other organic material they will gradually be broken down by anaerobic bacteria releasing more harmful methane (CH4) in addition to CO2.

There are strong similarities between compostable packaging and recyclable packaging. Just as printing “recyclable” on a container does not mean that it will actually get recycled printing “compostable” on a container does not ensure that it will be composted. One of the main drivers of low recycling rates is a lack of demand: It is often easier to just produce new materials rather than to collect sort clean and reprocess the old ones. Likewise it is generally easier to throw things in the garbage than sort them for composting. There are a few exceptions in the recycling sphere: Notably our system of levying deposits on beverage containers has motivated consumers to sort these materials and return them to depots resulting in high rates of recycling for these items. Recently driven in part by public demand a number of Canadian companies have pledged to ensure their plastics are made of 30-per-cent recycled content by 2025; this expanded market should drive the development of recycling facilities to divert materials that could otherwise end up in landfills.

To get the intended benefits of compostable plastic materials we need to start building the industrial composting facilities required to process these items in cities across Canada. We must also incentivize producers and consumers to make use of these facilities. Currently there is a disconnect between material production and disposal – producers and users might be moving toward greater adoption of compostable plastic but responsibility for waste management lies with local governments who don’t necessarily have the means to dispose of it properly.

One way to quickly make a major impact could be to require large companies who label their packaging as “compostable” to also provide a suitable means of disposal. Fast-food outlets are responsible for a significant amount of plastic waste; requiring or incentivizing these companies to collect and process their waste in a responsible manner could make a significant dent in this problem while also driving infrastructure development for composting. Small communities universities shopping malls and other entities that have some control over their waste streams could implement their own industrial composting systems as well; there is even a variety of small-scale (i.e. barrel-sized to trailer-sized) industrial composting systems available that automate the process.

Scientists and engineers are making tremendous progress in developing new solutions to address the challenges of plastics including developing new processes to produce biodegradable plastics designing improved methods and materials for recycling and engineering production techniques and equipment that help accelerate the degradation of biodegradable materials. Now it is up to us as a society to make the decision to implement these innovations on a scale that can positively affect our environment.

As per National Inventory on Generation and Management of Hazardous and Other Wastes (2020-21) report published by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in 2020-21 10.92 million tonne of hazardous waste (including quantity imported and previous stock) has been generated. For management of hazardous waste major contribution has been towards utilization (i.e. 4.18 million tonne including co-processing) followed by disposal (2.89 million MT) in secured landfill/incinerator and recycling (1.44 million MT).

How are Cement Plants Helping

Clinker is the main product of Cement Plants & the process of clinkerization requires high thermal & electrical energy. Energy demand in cement kiln is accounting for 30-40 % of production costs. To meet the thermal energy requirement cement plants are mainly dependent on conventional fuels like coal and pet coke. Co-processing refers to the use of waste materials in industrial processes like cement plants as alternative fuels or raw material (AFR) to recover energy and material from them. In the process of co-processingthe conventional fuel is substituted by hazardous & non-hazardous wastes having significant heat value.

Cement Plants are Best Incinerators

Co-processing in cement kiln is considered as environmentally sustainable option for the management of different kinds of wastes including hazardous and other wastes. In co-processing these wastes are not only destroyed at a higher temperature of up to 1450°C and long residence time during which its inorganic content gets fixed with the clinker and becomes part of cement apart from using the energy content of the wastes thus no residues are left. While in case of incineration the residual ash requires to be land filled as hazardous waste. Further the acidic gases if any generated during co-processing gets neutralized in the large alkaline environment available within the kiln system. However for co-processing of waste in cement kilns pre-processing of waste is a pre-requisite to ensure smooth cement plant operation with uniform quality of clinker. Cement plants also incur huge investment cost for installation of proper AF feeding system.

Reducing the Burden on Waste Management

Indian cement industry has been able to substitute 6% of conventional fuels on thermal basis using alternate fuels. Of the 4.18 million tonne of hazardous waste utilized 45% has been contributed by co-processing alone. There are 96 cement plants in India today that are involved in co-processing of hazardous waste. Various hazardous waste co-processed by cement industry are Textile ETP Sludge Tannery ETP Sludge TDI tar paint sludge process waste waste residue chemical sludge Process Sludge Phosphate sludge Chemical Sludge from ETP Insulation Waste Mixed Salt Organic residue Liquid Organic Residue spent solvent benzofuran waste lubricant oil. This phenomenon also reduces the non-renewable resources requirement such as coal. Thus the utilization of wastes in cement kilns through co-processing provides a win–win option of waste disposal.

Role of Government Agencies

Earlier many trial runs for co-processing of different kind of hazardous and other wastes in cement kiln were conducted with support of CPCB since the year 2005. CPCB published guidelines on co-processing of wastes in cement plants in the year 2010 and further published the updated guidelines in 2017 as per the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management & Trans boundary Movement) Rules 2016.For co-processing of hazardous waste in cement kilns authorization from State Pollution Control Board is required. Further no trial runs are required for grant of authorization for co-processing of wastes in cement kilns since Ministry of Environment Forest sand Climate Change has notified the Emission Standards for co-processing of wastes in cement kiln in 2016.

Definitely not a show for people who say ""Can you just shut up and play your damn music?""

Get our weekly picks of what to do this weekend and the latest on Philly's arts and entertainment scene.

When I heard that Pink Floyd co-founder and some would say mastermind Roger Waters was miffed that news outlets weren’t reviewing his his latest tour because they prioritized more modern acts like Drake and the Weeknd — both performers Waters insisted he is “far far far more important than” in a recent interview — I knew I had to get to the Wells Fargo Center in South Philadelphia on Friday night for “Roger Waters: This Is Not a Drill.”

Like so many tours happening now this one was supposed to hit the road in 2020 but became a victim of the pandemic. The postponed tour commenced in early July and wraps up this October with Philadelphia one of only four U.S. cities where Waters has a two-night engagement.

If you’re one of those people who think musicians should leave their politics and personal beliefs out of their shows I suggest you look somewhere other than this for your big night out on the town. Maybe wait until August 14th and catch Barry Manilow and his anemic Copacabana‘ing at the same venue. Waters isn’t one to shy away from saying exactly what’s on his mind.

Take for example his previous tour launched four months after Donald Trump became president. Some fans didn’t take too kindly to the anti-Trump messaging and imagery laced throughout the concerts: Trump in a Ku Klux Klan hood. Trump’s face on a giant flying pig. A pants-less Trump showing off a tiny penis. There were boos. People walked out. When CNN asked Waters to comment on the audience response he suggested those who didn’t like it should “go see Katy Perry or watch the Kardashians.”

Well five years and one pandemic later Waters hasn’t exactly mellowed out as he makes clear before the show even begins with a message that appears on the several screens above the stage and is also spoken over the sound system: “If you’re one of those ‘I love Pink Floyd but I can’t stand Roger’s politics’ people… you might do well to fuck off to the bar right now.”

And sure enough Waters made his positions quite clear in the show that followed mostly with messages on those screens that supported causes like trans reproductive and Native American rights and spoke out against police warmongering capitalism oligarchs and every president from Ronald Reagan to the present commander-in-chief designating them all as war criminals for one reason or another.

Say what you will about all that the man puts on an astonishing production. And that’s exactly what this show is — a production filled with lasers and wild lighting and audio effects in true surround-sound. Keep in mind: This is a man who constructed a 40-foot-tall wall across the huge stage at Citizens Bank Park for the “Roger Waters: The Wall” tour 10 years ago—in the middle of the show. And then it came falling down.

The current spectacle is almost too much to fully absorb in one sitting which is how audiences felt after watching 2001: A Space Odyssey or say Donnie Darko for the first time. If you’re the type of person who likes to ingest various psychedelic substances before a concert I have to tell you: Ya don’t need them. There’s plenty of mind-warping stimulation to go around.

Waters and several other singers and musicians perform in the round so there’s really not a bad seat in the house. A friend who watched from the nosebleeds while I was much closer in section 114 suggested the show might actually be better taken in from a bit further back so you can see the full effect. I found that to be the case with the aforementioned “Wall” tour after taking in both the 10th-row center and the very last row in the tippy-top of Citizens Bank Park. The sound is remarkably good from anywhere a hallmark of all Waters and Pink Floyd shows for decades.

The first set begins with a new and much different treatment of “Comfortably Numb” than the one you’re familiar with from The Wall: sparse and solemn. Gone are the soaring guitar solos. A Pink Floyd purist might scoff at the new arrangement though if you were playing the same song the same exact way on every tour since 1979 you too might want to shake things up a bit.

But don’t worry. Waters moves into pretty note-for-note versions of other songs from The Wall in that first set before resurrecting a few tunes from his various solo projects. Should you choose this latter moment to take a pee break after consuming a $17 Stella Artois or three be sure to get back in time for some classic offerings from Wish You Were Here and Animals.

If Dark Side of the Moon is on your list of Best Albums Ever you’re going to want to stick around for the second set because that’s where you’ll be treated to half the album — along with more political messaging of course. And yes there’s a flying pig.

Waters is all of 78 so who knows how many tours he has in his future? He has amusingly noted that this is his “first farewell tour.” And since the chances of Pink Floyd ever reuniting are about as likely as seeing a pig fly (okay bad example in this case) this could very well be your last opportunity to hear songs from their catalog performed live by one of the guys who wrote them.

No 53 Mission Aircrew Course Graduation

ON Thursday July 21 2022 the Air Mission Training School (AMTS) located at RAAF Base East Sale held its Graduation Parade for No 53 Mission Aircrew Course.

The five graduates from No 53 Mission Aircrew Course have undergone up to 12 months of extensive aviation training and have successfully graduated as winged Mission Aircrew taking the number of Air Mission Training School Graduates to a total of 1539 from six nations since its inception in 1946.

The Graduation Parade made a memorable day for the five graduates and their families with the Commander Air Mobility Group Air Commodore Carl Newman attending as the Reviewing Officer.

The Graduation Parade also included a Welcome to Country and Smoking Ceremony which was conducted by Aunty Sandra Patten from the Gunaikurnai Land and Waters Aboriginal Corporation as well as low-level flypasts of two Royal Australian Air Force EA-18G Growler aircraft from No 6 Squadron.

Commanding Officer Air Mission Training School Wing Commander Arran Moore congratulated the graduates on their achievements saying “What these five graduates have achieved over the last 12 months of training is remarkable.”

“They have progressed from their initial officer training to being able to plan command and manage complex airborne missions across a broad spectrum of operations. The resilience these five have shown both in their training and also against the backdrop of COVID-19 and lockdowns is testament to their strength of character and will position them well for future success in their careers.

“All the staff at AMTS are proud to have instructed them through their training and join with their friends and family in congratulating the graduates on their achievements.

“I’d also like to take the opportunity to thank the Sale community for the continued support they provide the base its staff and students – without the continued strong support of our community we wouldn’t be able to graduate the quality of students that we do.”

Three of the graduates will proceed on to fly the P-8A Poseidon at No 292 Squadron located at RAAF Base Edinburgh near Adelaide.

They will continue to learn a number of mission sets including Anti-submarine Warfare Search and Rescue Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance and direct Support to Naval assets among others.

The remaining two graduates will proceed on to fast jet training initially at No 76 Squadron at RAAF Base Williamtown near Newcastle flying the Hawk 127.

Following their time at No 76 Squadron the graduates will become Weapon Systems Officers (WSO) on the F/A-18F Super Hornet or the E/A-18G Growler at RAAF Base Amberley outside Brisbane.

Removal of ‘Golf Ball’ Aircraft Surveillance Radar near Longford

AIR Force is installing nine new ASR-NG Fixed Defence Air Traffic Control Surveillance Sensors (FDATCSS) at various Australian locations for its AIR5431 Phase 2 Program.

For RAAF Base East Sale this means replacing the prominent ‘golf ball’ shaped Aircraft Surveillance Radar installed 34 years ago at Dutson to maintain safe air passage of military and civil aircraft within the Gippsland Region.

The 18-metre-high tower with its 15-metre-diameter radome or ‘golf ball’ is scheduled for decommissioning in September.

A temporary sensor is already in place for RAAF Base East Sale and will remain until third quarter 2023 when the new FDATCSS installation is complete.

The FDATCSS will improve national air traffic management and collaboration between Department of Defence and Airservices Australia.

IRVING Texas — Read this story and other North Texas business news from our content partners at the Dallas Business Journal



On Thursday night Irving City Council approved incentives totaling $31 million for a forthcoming office development that is expected to be home to a new Wells Fargo regional campus.

For years sources have said that Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) was targeting hundreds of thousands of square feet of office space to house thousands of workers eventually settling on a build-to-suit option in the Dallas suburb of Irving after scouring North Texas.

The banking giant has settled on two 400000-square-foot buildings with the potential to hold 4000 workers that are expected to be set within a broader mixed-use development.

A spokesperson for the San Francisco-based Wells Fargo declined to comment again on Monday when asked about the office development which was directly tied to the bank for the first time by this week’s city council agenda.

Is DFW becoming the nation’s new finance hub?

While North Texas has a deep history of homegrown firms focused on private equity banking and wealth management the region has added to that might with the addition of several financial heavyweights over the past several years.

That includes snagging headquarters for Charles Schwab in tandem with its TD Ameritrade merger in addition to expansions from JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs among others.

A more recent victory for the region includes the approval of a half-billion-dollar Goldman Sachs-anchored tower in Dallas developed by Hunt Realty.

With $18 million in incentives tied to the project the investment banking giant is expected to retain or create a minimum of 5000 full-time jobs by the end of 2028 in addition to occupying 800000 square feet with a 15-year lease term.

Dallas Director of Economic Development Robyn Bentley said in June that Goldman was considering ""the full spectrum of headquarters services"" not focused on a specific facet of the business when it comes to the jobs that would be housed in the new office. Those roles could range from accounting to finance and from tech to corporate jobs such as human resources and legal roles she said.

Since 2018 eight Fortune 500 companies have relocated their headquarters to Texas with five of those landing in North Texas. Irving scored McKesson’s move from San Francisco and Catepillar’s recently announced pilgrimage from Chicago. Dallas is now the home of CBRE and AECOM both of which migrated from Los Angeles while Charles Schwab headed to Westlake.

Some sources believe that a Wells Fargo regional campus of this size meant for this many employees could mean an eventual headquarters move as well. A spokesperson said in June that the firm had ‘no plans’ to move its headquarters.

What will Wells Fargo’s future regional campus look like?

Two separate incentive agreements passed on Thursday night: consisting of $19 million tied to improvements in a Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone through the Financial Services and Economic Development Departments and $12 million to aid in the construction of the regional campus through the Office of Economic Development. The latter was approved unanimously.

In order to receive the agreed-upon incentives Wells Fargo or company affiliates must purchase 22 acres near Las Colinas Blvd. and Promenade Parkway by the end of the year; construct and occupy two office buildings that are a minimum of 400000 square feet that are at least 10 stories by December 31 2026; and construct a parking garage housing at least 4000 spaces; among other requirements.

Wells Fargo must occupy the office space for 10 years and is required to increase the real property value by a minimum of $200 million by Jan. 1 2027 with the development.

The forthcoming office development will sit along Irving-Las Colinas’ Lake Carolyn across from Williams Square. Situated along West Las Colinas Boulevard and Promenade Parkway Dallas' KDC will develop the office project.

The two office buildings are expected to sit within a larger mixed-use development featuring multifamily space with restaurants and retail.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvc2xhdGUuY29tL3dlbGxzLWZhcmdvLWRpZ2l0YWwtYXNzZXRzLWFyZS1hbi1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLW9uLXBhci13aXRoLXRoZS1pbnRlcm5ldC1jYXJzLWFuZC1lbGVjdHJpY2l0eS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Wells Fargo: Digital assets are an ""innovation on par with the internet cars and electricity""","Wells Fargo the fourth largest bank in the U.S. by market capitalization has released a special report entitled “Understanding Cryptocurrency” which compares digital assets to the invention of “the internet cars and electricity.”

The Internet of Value

Produced by its Global Investment Strategy Team the report published at the start of August bullishly called digital assets “the building blocks of a new internet.” A comment directed to Wells Fargo investment customers stated that the advancement of digital assets will bring “new possibilities and investment opportunities.”

“Many expect digital assets to be the building blocks of a new internet the Internet of Value… The Internet of Value is likely to be disruptive to the world of finance just as the original internet was to communications and information. What it may mean for investors.”

The term “internet of value” is not new; speaking to CryptoSlate’s Akiba at Paris Blockchain week in March the Head of NFT & Fan Tokens for Binance Helen Hai referred to an internet of value as being the cornerstone of how she approaches crypto. However it is a term that makes a lot of sense in defining the difference between web 2.0 and web3. The image below compares the two.

Onboarding new crypto users

Interestingly Wells Fargo identified an important trend in the crypto industry of focusing on technology instead of the “big picture.” The user experience within crypto and web3 is notoriously poor with overcomplicated dApps and wallet management. New users face an exceptionally high entry barrier; seed phrases passphrases tokens blockchain and token transfers are all utterly alien to newcomers.

Wells Fargo stated that its special report series on crypto aims to “make sure newcomers see the big picture concepts before being buried in detail.” It cannot be understated how important this is for the advancement of crypto and web3. A household name in banking publishing a pro-crypto special report to educate non-crypto users on the long-term benefits of digital assets holds a lot of weight.

While many investors embedded within the crypto industry do not trust traditional banks a more significant subset of the broader U.S. population still depends on household name banks. Support from such an institution outside of simply promoting the purchase of Bitcoin as a part of strategic diversification does a lot to establish the legitimacy of digital assets in the broader population.

The report declared that it would refer to all cryptocurrencies smart contracts and other tokens as “digital assets.” In itself this use of language is a concrete step toward improving the user experience by removing pre-conceived ideas around terms such as cryptocurrency NFTs and tokens.

The Conclusion

With the final six pages of the report Wells Fargo made comparisons between how the current version of the internet reinvented post offices music stores landlines and local news. It used these comparisons to attempt to create a yardstick to explain how “The Internet of Value” will reinvent local currencies payment networks securities property and contracts.

Real-world examples of payment processing remittances and other uses of digital assets were described in the report before attempting an explanation of the Bitcoin lightning network. The image in the description echoed Jack Mallers demonstration of using the lightning network to send fiat currencies. Wells Fargo declared “early movers may get to ride the open network effects and gain economies of scale while those late to the movement may lose.”

Wells Fargo concluded the report by stating ”

The Senate on August 7 voted 51 to 50 along party lines to pass the “Inflation Reduction Act'' budget reconciliation bill (the bill). The tie-breaking vote in the evenly divided Senate was provided by Vice President Kamala Harris. The Senate action clears the way for the House to return from its August recess on Friday August 12 to vote on the bill.

Observation: House Democratic leaders expect to be able to pass the bill without change so it can be signed into law by President Biden before the end of August.

The bill features significant changes to federal prescription drug pricing policies that seek to reduce costs for individuals receiving care through Medicare. The bill also includes a three-year extension of expanded Affordable Care Act (ACA) health care benefits through 2025.

Key revenue-raising provisions affecting pharmaceutical companies include (1) a 15% book-income alternative minimum tax on corporations with financial accounting profits over $1 billion and (2) a 1% excise tax on a publicly traded US corporation for the value of its stock that is repurchased by the corporation during the tax year.

Action item: Stakeholders should analyze the bill and communicate with policy makers on the potential effects of such tax increases on their employees job creation and investments in the United States.

Now It's Racing to Catch Up. (Published 2022),"TOKYO — It was the spring of 2021 and demand for new cars was spiking. But as consumers flush with savings amassed during the pandemic rushed to dealerships around the world one Japanese automaker after another idled production as they waited for imports of a critical component: semiconductors.

Coronavirus outbreaks had shut down chip plants and an unanticipated surge in demand for electronics from people riding out the pandemic at home had constrained supplies. Nissan alone predicted a cut in output of half a million vehicles.

The chip shortfall — a blow to “the head” of Japan’s economy in the words of Yoshihiro Seki a lawmaker who leads a study group on semiconductors — woke up the country to the fragility of the supply chains that undergird its most important industries.

That has driven a broad reconsideration of how Japan can protect its economy the world’s third largest against both unforeseen economic shocks like the pandemic and looming risks like the rising tensions between the United States and China. Those risks were highlighted this week as the House speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan prompting an angry response from China.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vYmxvY2tzYW5kZmlsZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMDYva2lveGlhLXNjbS14bC1mbGFzaC1hbmQtdG9zaGliYS14bC1mbGFzaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kioxia updates XL-FLASH storage-class memory with MLC tier – Blocks and Files,"Kioxia exhibited second-generation storage class memory flash at the FMS 2022 event in Santa Clara with a lower cost per GB than gen 1.

Update. Active plane clarification added to penultimate paragraph. 10 August 2022.

The FL6 storage-class memory SSD from Kioxia is based on first-generation XL-FLASH technology. The storage-class memory was called gen-2 XL-FLASH and unlike the all-SLC (1 bit/cell) gen 1 this one adds MLC (2bits/cell) NAND to the mix. This enables a die capacity of 256Gbit. Two four or eight layers of chips can be stacked in one package.

Curiously the sample device in Kioxia’s booth bore a Toshiba brand and not a Kioxia one

The MLC addition it states “significantly reduces bit cost while providing high performance.” Kioxia provided no performance details but declared that the maximum number of simultaneously operating planes has also increased from the current model which will allow for improved throughput.

It also said CXL support could be added in the future.

The Toshiba branding was perplexing as the device was exhibited on the Kioxia stand at FMS 2022 but maybe there’s a stock of existing cases.

The 2019 XL-FLASH announcement from Toshiba Memory America revealed gen-1 XL-FLASH details:

128 gigabit die (in a 2-die 4-die 8-die package);

4KB page size for more efficient operating system reads and writes;

16-plane architecture for more efficient parallelism;

Fast page read and program times – XL-FLASH provides a low read latency of less than 5 microseconds approximately 10 times faster than existing TLC;

We thought that the gen-2 XL-FLASH could have 32 planes but we were wrong as a Kioxia spokesperson said: “The number of active simultaneous planes in BiCS5 XL-FLASH has increased from 4 to 8. The total number of planes for both generations is 16.”

We also think that there could be a successor to the FL6 – the FL7 perhaps – built using gen-2 XL-FLASH. In fact we would put money on that.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvd2JveXNpbmRpYW5zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4L2NpLWRpZ2l0YWwtc3RyZWFtaW5nLWd1aWRlLWNsaW50LWVhc3R3b29kcy11bmZvcmdpdmVuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,C&I Digital Streaming Guide: Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven,"The last traditional western to win the Oscar for Best Picture opened in theaters 30 years ago this weekened.

The retired gunfighter who must return to his bloody business one last time. The hotheaded youngster who must back up his bragging when push comes to shove. The small-town sheriff who must face down the hired killers riding his way. The brutally wronged woman who must rely on the firepower of a steely-eyed stranger.

Now available on several streaming platforms Unforgiven abounds in the time-honored archetypes that have been the staples of westerns since the heyday of Tom Mix. Which isn't at all surprising considering the 1992 movie — the last traditional western to win the Academy Award for Best Picture — came to us from Clint Eastwood who played a major role in demythologizing many of these elements for the better part of four decades.

First as an actor in such films as A Fistful of Dollars and Hang 'Em High and later as his own director in star vehicles such as High Plains Drifter and The Outlaw Josey Wales Eastwood upended clichés sullied stereotypes and challenged assumptions — sometimes in dead seriousness sometimes with sardonic humor.

In his Oscar-winning Unforgiven however Eastwood ventured even further into the dark underside of the western mythos and to the very top of his form as an actor and filmmaker. This is a great movie and a major source of its greatness is Eastwood’s and screenwriter David Webb Peoples’ darkly ambiguous view of the very things that made most of us so fond of Westerns in the first place.

In a terrific cast Eastwood is first among equals as William Munny a gunfighter once feared as “a man of notoriously vicious and intemperate disposition.” He was reformed by the love of a good woman and domesticated by the demands of a pig farm and two children. Unfortunately as Unforgiven begins Munny’s wife is two years dead the pig farm is failing — and Munny’s worried about how he will provide for his offspring.

Meanwhile off in the remote town of Big Whiskey Wyoming the local sheriff Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman) maintains law and order with a whim of iron. Two drunken cowboys cut up a prostitute in a late-night fracas and the other hookers demand prompt equally brutal justice. But Little Bill merely orders the cowboys to pay a fine of six horses — to the owner of the bordello not to the disfigured prostitute herself — and lets it go at that. “It's not like they were tramps or loafers or bad men” Little Bill explains.

So the prostitutes led by the fiery Strawberry Alice (Frances Fisher) pool their savings to raise a $1000 bounty on the two cowboys. In no time at all a hotheaded youngster named The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett) shows up at Munny’s door seeking Munny’s help in collecting the reward. Although initially reluctant Munny unpacks his guns and approaches another retired gunfighter Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) to suggest a three-way split for the blood money in Big Whiskey.

For a revisionist Western Unforgiven is in many respects almost defiantly old-fashioned. Eastwood is deliberate even contemplative in his unhurried pacing suggesting the slow steady build of a gathering storm. And he fully understands the dramatic thematic and emotional impacts that can be gained simply by creating the illusion of real time passing. When Munny Logan and the Kid track down and shoot one of the errant cowboys it takes a long time for him to die — long enough for at least one of the bounty-hunters to be profoundly affected and for the audience to be shaken out of its instinctive sympathy for the nominal good guys.

Later the cocksure Kid breaks down as he fully grasps the enormity of cold-blooded murder. “It's a hell of a thing killing a man” Munny agrees. “You take away all he's got and all he's ever going to have.” The Kid suggests that the victim had it coming. Munny replies “We all have it coming Kid.”

Time and again during Unforgiven Eastwood shoves our faces in the consequences of violence the horrible consequences for killer and victim. There are no true heroics here only varying degrees of violence and self-delusion. Everything leads to a final shootout that is as terrifyingly bloody and chaotic as any ever staged for a western. The big difference with this one is Eastwood gives you a strong sense that this is how such things probably happened in real life with no clear-cut heroes or villains with dying men groaning that they don't “deserve” their fate. “I'll see you in hell” a victim warns Munny. Munny isn't moved. Hell will hold no surprises for him.

It’s worth noting that in the 30 years since Unforgiven was released Eastwood has not returned to the western genre either as actor or director. Perhaps that’s because in the wake of his 1992 magnum opus he feels there’s nothing left to say nothing new to add. So he’s leaving it up to others to carry the torch.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsbGUuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvY2VsZWJyaXRpZXMvYTQwODI0NjI2L2tpbS1rYXJkYXNoaWFuLWthbnllLXdlc3QtYWZ0ZXItcGV0ZS1kYXZpZHNvbi1zcGxpdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Kim Kardashian and Kanye West Are Getting Along After Pete Davidson Split,"After nine months together Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson have split. The connection began on the set of Saturday Night Live when Kardashian was serving as a host and they felt some chemistry on set. The comedian is currently shooting a film in Australia and the distance apparently brought home some issues in their relationship around how much time and energy they have to share with one another. They still have “a lot of love and respect for each other” according to a source speaking with E! News.

Some fans have wondered what this might mean for Kardashian and her ex-husband Kanye West. The SKIMS founder was declared legally single in March as other aspects of the official divorce are being worked out in court. During the early months of Kardashian's relationship with Davidson West was very vocal about wanting to reunite with his ex-wife and his dislike of her new boyfriend. They have since resolved their issues and “are happily co-parenting.”

However that doesn't mean anything more will be happening between them.

“Kim was happy to be asked to be a part of the campaign with the kids and to support Kanye in this way” another insider told E! News “but it's not a sign of them getting back together.”

During a virtual appearance at a Friday hearing in L.A. court Kardashian's attorney Laura Wasser said that “the parties are getting along and are in communication.”

“Kim and Kanye have been co-parenting in a healthy way lately” said another insider. “Things are cordial between them. Being a great dad has always been very important to Kanye and his main goal is to keep his children happy. He has been trying to keep any intense emotions out of anything and focus on what matters most to him which is taking care of his family.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzYXQuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMi8wOC8wNi9zYXBkLW9uZS1kZWFkLW9uZS1ob3NwaXRhbGl6ZWQtaW4tZmF0YWwtc2hvb3RpbmctYXQtd2VzdC1zaWRlLWFwYXJ0bWVudC1jb21wbGV4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SAPD: 1 dead 1 hospitalized after shooting at West Side apartment complex,"SAN ANTONIO – The San Antonio Police Department is investigating a fatal shooting that left one man dead and another hospitalized.

At 1:57 a.m. Saturday officers were called to the 6500 block of West Commerce Street for a shooting.

Upon arrival officers discovered a man lying on the ground of the parking lot with apparent gunshot wounds. He was taken in critical condition to an area hospital.

At the opposite end of the parking lot officers then found another man with a gunshot wound. He was pronounced deceased at the scene.

According to SAPD several people from the complex heard the shots but did not see the shooting or hear any altercation.

One tenant saw a silver car drive away after the shooting but it is unknown if the car was involved.

Authorities searched the scene but there were no findings related to the shooting.

As recently as February one of its developers NextEra Energy warned that the many legal and regulatory obstacles meant there was “a very low probability of pipeline completion.”

Then came Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and his hold on the Democrats’ climate agenda.

Mr. Manchin’s recent surprise agreement to back the Biden administration’s historic climate legislation came about in part because the senator was promised something in return: not only support for the pipeline in his home state but also expedited approval for pipelines and other infrastructure nationwide as part of a wider set of concessions to fossil fuels.

It was a big win for a pipeline industry that in recent years has quietly become one of Mr. Manchin’s biggest financial supporters.

Natural gas pipeline companies have dramatically increased their contributions to Mr. Manchin from just $20000 in 2020 to more than $331000 so far this election cycle according to campaign finance disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission and tallied by the Center for Responsive Politics.

A multibillion-dollar aerospace and technology company with a Tulsa facility plans to finalize the building and configuration of at least six specialized aircraft for the military here beginning this fall.

With an initial government grant of $170 million L3Harris will equip and make flight-ready at least six AT-802U Sky Warden planes in Tulsa.

The manned single-engine turboprop aircraft is designed for airborne intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance as well as missions in extreme combat environments.

It is designed to perform in austere disaggregated combat environments with limited infrastructure. It has unparalleled range and endurance weapons sensor and communication capabilities the company said.

The contract for now has a cost ceiling of $3 billion.

“I was ecstatic” Luke Savoie president of intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance for L3Harris told the Tulsa World last week when asked about news of the grant. “This is very personal to me.”

Savoie is a former Air Force pilot of the AC-130 gunship and other aircraft and had a large role in designing and developing the Sky Warden platform.

Many of the Sky Warden’s features are proprietary and its capabilities — depending on its individual specifications for the military — are not available publicly Savoie acknowledged.

However he said depending on the aircraft’s sensors a pilot would be able to pinpoint a specific point where an enemy is firing.

“I can look out the window and I can see someone shooting. And I can sit there on the throttle and hit a button and drop a point of where I was looking at. I saw someone shooting a weapon — I drop a point right there” he said.

“And I can go over here and hit another button and the auto-pilot — based on what I was just looking at — will now automatically put the aircraft into orbit around that point.

“I hit another button ... and now the fire control is targeting that position. So I have a sensor looking at it the fire control has updated that — that’s what it should be targeting — and now I can just roll in and put a shot off and engage that and never have had to sit there in tight coordinates or do all these weird mouse clicks and all this other stuff (at a distance with drone military aircraft)” Savoie said.

“It’s fairly tightly integrated and digitally controlled. And that’s the greatest thing about the weapons system is how tightly that all works.”

He declined to say the cost range for each aircraft depending on its specific weapons and sensor configuration but a news release by the company said the Sky Warden is “affordable.”

The plane’s intended use is for close combat support by the Air Force Savoie said but could also potentially be sold to U.S. allies.

“Sky Warden has a demand out there. If you’re a nation state that deals with violent extremists — if you’re either budget constrained or you’re infrastructure constrained or you need things to be multi-role ... this provides options for those potential types of customers” he said.

“I’m honored to be part of this program and provide this capability to customers. We look forward to growing ... and expanding our presence in the state and look forward to supporting the state of Oklahoma” he said.

U.S. Special Operations Command selected L3Harris and Air Tractor Inc.’s Sky Warden system for its Armed Overwatch program.

With an initial program contract award of $170 million the program could include delivery of up to 75 aircraft.

Production of new fully modified Armed Overwatch mission-configured aircraft will begin in 2023 at L3Harris’ Tulsa modification center the company said in a news release following initial production at the Air Tractor Inc.’s Olney Texas aircraft manufacturing facility.

Air Tractor is a manufacturer of aircraft for agricultural firefighting and utility applications. Olney is about 130 miles northwest of Dallas and 40 miles south of Wichita Falls.

In Tulsa since 1974 and at Tulsa International Airport since 2013 L3Harris develops maintains and operates airborne missile tracking systems in support of the Missile Defense Agency Airborne Sensor Program.

The Melbourne Florida-based company is a technology supplier for military government and commercial partners.

L3Harris employs 306 people in Tulsa and with the contract is looking to expand with about 100 new positions including engineers and mechanical and electrical installers Savoie said.

In November the company announced an expansion of operations in Tulsa with plans to create at least 80 new jobs.

“We’ve been a strong supporter of L3 in wanting to put them in a position to be successful by providing world-class facilities for them to do their work just like we do with so many other rapidly growing companies out there at the airport” Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum said at the time.

“This is really in my mind this is one of our greatest opportunities for growth as it relates to Tulsa’s economy. It’s the industrial cluster that we have right here at the airport” Bynum said.

People in the Tulsa area could see the planes flying from Texas to L3Harris’ facility at Tulsa International Airport as soon as this fall Savoie said.

“The Sky Warden design reflects our commitment to America’s national security and the AT-802U will be equipped with everything we’ve learned manufacturing aircraft over the past 46 years” Air Tractor President Jim Hirsch said in a statement.

“The L3Harris team is an excellent partner and our production and engineering staff are ready to immediately deliver this world-class product to our nation’s special forces” Hirsch said.

L3Harris has more than $17 billion in annual revenue and 47000 employees with customers in more than 100 countries according to its website.

“Sky Warden will bring powerful and affordable close air support precision strike armed ISR (intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance) and command and control capabilities directly to special operations forces in the battlefield” Sean Stackley president of integrated mission systems for L3Harris said in a statement.

For more than a century Wall Street has been a wealth-building machine for those who are patient. Over long periods high-quality companies and the indexes they're a part of tend to increase in value.

Something else that's commonplace on Wall Street is change. It's perfectly normal for innovation acquisitions competitive advantages and other factors to shake up the world's largest publicly traded companies on a fairly regular basis.

Just 18 years ago companies like General Electric AIG and Intel were among the 10 largest publicly traded companies by market cap. As of Aug. 4 Intel wasn't even in the top 50 any longer while GE and AIG had fallen out of the top 125 and top 250 respectively. Eight years from now in 2030 the stock market's 10 largest stocks could look vastly different than they do today.

While absolutely nothing is set in stone I predict that the following 10 stocks will have the largest market caps by 2030. Note that these 10 companies aren't listed in any particular order.

1. Berkshire Hathaway

The first stock conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.61%) (BRK.B 0.60%) should retain its spot in the top 10 even if billionaire CEO Warren Buffett isn't at the helm come 2030. After overseeing an average annual return on the company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of 20.1% since 1965 Buffett has clearly shown he's set his company up for long-term success.

One factor that makes Berkshire Hathaway such an incredible company is the mountain of passive income it collects every year. Over the next 12 months Buffett's company is expected to bring in well over $6 billion in dividend income with $4.25 billion coming from just a handful of companies. Because dividend stocks have a long history of outperforming nondividend payers holding these time-tested companies for years or decades provides an added boost.

2. Apple

Perhaps the least-surprising prediction is that the largest publicly traded company in the U.S. Apple (AAPL 1.00%) will remain in the top 10 largest stocks by market cap by 2030.

Aside from an easily recognized brand name and faithful customer base Apple's innovation is key to its success. Introducing a 5G-capable iPhone quickly pushed up its market share in the U.S. while CEO Tim Cook is busy leading a multiyear transition that emphasizes subscription services. Ultimately subscriptions should boost Apple's operating margins and lessen the sales volatility witnessed during product replacement cycles.

Apple has also repurchased $520 billion worth of its own common stock since the beginning of 2013. If this aggressive buyback program continues value investors are likely to continue plowing into Apple.

3. Visa

Payment processor Visa (V 0.49%) currently finds itself on the outside looking in (No. 11). By the turn of the decade I expect it to firmly find itself as one of the 10 largest companies by market cap.

Visa's opportunity for expansion is enormous. Most global transactions are still being conducted in cash which means it can expand organically into underbanked regions such as the Middle East Africa and Southeastern Asia or lean on acquisitions to grow (e.g. the Visa Europe buyout in 2016). Sustained double-digit annual growth should be the expectation throughout the decade.

What's more Visa strictly sticks to payment processing. Although the company would probably do just fine as a lender it would also expose Visa to potential loan delinquencies and losses during recessions. By avoiding lending Visa is able to bounce back from economic downturns faster than its peers and maintain a profit margin above 50%.

4. Alphabet

Another FAANG stock that has an exceptionally high likelihood of retaining its top-10 ranking by market cap come 2030 is Alphabet (GOOGL 0.34%) (GOOG 0.24%) the parent company of internet search engine Google and streaming platform YouTube.

Google has long been Alphabet's foundational operating segment. Over the past two years it's handled no less than 91% of global internet search share a big reason why Alphabet sports such incredible ad-pricing power. As traffic acquisition costs decline over time Google should continue to be a cash cow for the company.

But Alphabet's future is about its higher-growth initiatives like YouTube and Google Cloud. YouTube has grown into the second-most-visited social site in the world while Google Cloud has gobbled up 8% of global cloud infrastructure spending.

5. Salesforce

Cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software provider Salesforce (CRM -1.36%) could make one of the biggest leaps (currently No. 43) in terms of market cap by 2030. CRM software is what's used to help businesses enhance customer relationships and boost sales.

Global CRM software sales are expected to sustain double-digit growth through at least mid-decade which is great news for the industry's unquestioned leader. According to IDC Salesforce commanded a 23.8% share of CRM software spending in 2021 (over four times its next-closest competitor).

In addition to its commanding market share co-CEO and co-founder Marc Benioff has a penchant for making earnings-accretive acquisitions. These deals broaden the Salesforce ecosystem and help with the company's cross-selling opportunities.

6. Amazon

E-commerce stock Amazon (AMZN 0.80%) is another really strong bet to retain its spot in among the 10 largest stocks by the turn of the decade.

Most folks know Amazon for its industry-leading online marketplace. In 2022 eMarketer projects that Amazon will account for 39.5% of all U.S. online retail sales. But the real crown jewel is the more than 200 million Prime members who've signed up as a result of its leading marketplace. The fees collected from Prime members help Amazon expand its logistics network and reinvest in high-growth initiatives.

There's also Amazon Web Services (AWS) which is the global No. 1 in cloud infrastructure spending with 33% market share. Corporate cloud spending is still in its early innings which means Amazon's operating cash flow could skyrocket in the years ahead.

7. PayPal Holdings

The company I predict will make the biggest leap into the top 10 stocks by market cap is fintech giant PayPal Holdings (PYPL 1.00%). PayPal is currently No. 88 with a $112 billion market cap.

Digital payments are still in their infancy which bodes well for fee-based payment platforms. Even with U.S. gross domestic product declining in back-to-back quarters PayPal's total payment volume on its network continues to grow by a double-digit percentage on a constant-currency basis.

Arguably even more important active users are more engaged than ever. At the end of 2020 active users were completing 40.9 transactions over the trailing 12 months (ttm). This figure is up to 48.7 transactions per active account on a ttm basis through June 2022 and it continues to climb.

8. Microsoft

Software kingpin Microsoft (MSFT 0.43%) the only company from the 10 largest stocks by market cap in 1999 to still have a top-10 position today has a good shot at sustaining its dominance throughout the decade.

Microsoft's success is a function of raking in mammoth amounts of cash flow from its legacy operations and funneling this cash into faster-growing projects. For instance even though its high-margin Windows franchise is generally a slow grower it still accounts for a 76% share of global desktop operating systems.

Microsoft is utilizing this cash flow to reinvest in a variety of cloud initiatives -- Azure is the global No. 2 in cloud infrastructure spending and grew sales by 46% on a constant-currency basis in the June-ended quarter -- and fuel acquisitions. For instance Microsoft offered $68.7 billion to acquire gaming company Activision Blizzard in January.

9. Chevron

Despite a feverish renewable energy push by most developed countries I predict oil and gas major Chevron (CVX 1.79%) will find its way into 10 largest publicly traded companies by market cap in 2030.

The biggest reason for this push is the expectation that oil and natural gas prices will remain elevated for many years to come. The pandemic resulted in multiple years of reduced domestic and international drilling and pipeline investment. Couple this with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and you'll see there's a clear risk to global energy supply.

Chevron is also in excellent financial shape compared to most other integrated oil stocks. By prudently deploying its capital and minimizing debt Chevron has been able to maintain its superior dividend repurchase its own stock and fund key natural gas projects in the Asia-Pacific region.

10. Meta Platforms

Lastly social media stock Meta Platforms (META 0.60%) the company formerly known as Facebook should find itself as one of the 10 largest stocks in 2030. You'll note that current top-10 stocks Tesla (TSLA -1.57%) UnitedHealth Group (UNH 0.76%) Nvidia (NVDA -1.84%) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 0.60%) didn't make the cut.

Although social media usage statistics can be extremely fickle to project one year in advance let alone in eight years Meta has four of the most downloaded apps in the world. On a combined basis Facebook Instagram WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger attracted 3.65 billion monthly active users in the June-ended quarter. That's over half the global adult population and a big reason why Facebook's ad-pricing power is exceptionally strong more often than not.

The wild card is the company's metaverse ambitions the ""metaverse"" being the next iteration of the internet that allows connected users to interact with each other and their surroundings in a 3D virtual environment. It will be years before the necessary infrastructure is in place to support the metaverse. But once there Meta's hefty investments could make it a key player in this potentially $30 trillion opportunity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh5ZHJvZ2VuZnVlbG5ld3MuY29tL3doYXQtaXMteWVsbG93LWh5ZHJvZ2VuLzg1NTI4NDMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exploring The Wonders Of Yellow Hydrogen - Hydrogen News,"As H2 gains focus worldwide as countries aim to decarbonize different forms are standing out.

Yellow hydrogen is somewhat of a new designation among different forms of H2 even though the method it uses to produce the clean fuel isn’t anything new.

This form of H2 has previously been lumped into the renewable green designation.

Yellow hydrogen is essentially a form of green hydrogen. Green refers to the types of production that are powered by renewable energy in order to avoid greenhouse gas emissions. Renewable forms of energy include wind and solar for instance. It is from precisely that breakdown that this newer designation has sprung.

As the name suggests it is a type of H2 that is made through electrolysis that is powered by solar energy. While it remains a form of green since it is powered by renewable energy it is a more specific designation to clarify precisely what form of renewable electricity is used to power the process.

Click to learn more about many of the other different hydrogen colors and what their production means to their carbon emissions.

Yellow hydrogen is increasing in popularity as countries seek H2 with zero carbon emissions.

Renewable produced H2 isn’t the only form of the fuel that doesn’t produce greenhouse gas emissions. Red hydrogen for instance is made using nuclear power. That said even though the production process doesn’t result in carbon emissions it does still create nuclear waste which isn’t always considered ideal.

Yellow hydrogen uses solar panels to collect energy from the sun and convert it into electricity. That electricity is then used to power the electrolyzers that split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The renewable power allows this process to occur without greenhouse gas emissions.

The resulting H2 is also used without producing greenhouse gas emissions meaning that it is often viewed as one of the cleanest alternatives to using fossil fuels.

Among the primary challenges associated with yellow hydrogen include the cost of production when compared to the cost of the fossil fuel it would replace as well as determining what to do with solar panels when they reach the end of their lifecycles. This involves determining how long does a solar panel last and how to recycle them when the time comes so they don’t end up another problem for landfills.

Yellow Hydrogen FAQ’s…

What is yellow hydrogen and how is it different from grey or blue hydrogen?

Yellow hydrogen is a form of renewable energy that is produced by extracting hydrogen gas from water through a process called electrolysis. It is referred to as “yellow” because it is generated using solar power making it a completely carbon-free source of energy. In contrast grey hydrogen is produced from natural gas which emits high levels of carbon dioxide during its extraction and processing. Blue hydrogen on the other hand is also made from natural gas but uses carbon capture technology to minimize its carbon footprint.

How can yellow hydrogen be used as a source of energy?

Yellow hydrogen can be used in a variety of ways including as a fuel for cars buses and other forms of transportation as well as for heating homes and powering industries. It can also be used to generate electricity through fuel cells which convert hydrogen into electrical energy.

What are the benefits of yellow hydrogen over traditional forms of energy?

Yellow hydrogen has several advantages over traditional forms of energy such as coal or natural gas. Firstly it is completely renewable and does not produce any harmful emissions making it much cleaner for the environment. Secondly it can be produced locally using solar power which reduces dependence on foreign oil and gas. Finally it is highly versatile and can be used in a wide range of applications from transportation to industry.

Is yellow hydrogen cost-effective compared to other forms of energy?

While the initial investment in producing yellow hydrogen can be relatively high its long-term cost-effectiveness is improving as solar power becomes more affordable. Additionally as more industries and governments prioritize reducing their carbon footprint the demand for clean energy sources like yellow hydrogen is likely to increase.

What is the future of yellow hydrogen and its role in the transition to a carbon-free economy?

Yellow hydrogen is poised to play a critical role in the transition to a carbon-free economy as it offers a sustainable and versatile alternative to traditional fossil fuels. Many countries and companies around the world are already investing heavily in the development and deployment of hydrogen technology and experts predict that this trend will continue to grow in the coming years. As the world becomes more aware of the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions yellow hydrogen is likely to become an increasingly important source of renewable energy.

The Take Away…

As countries worldwide aim to decarbonize and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions hydrogen has emerged as a promising alternative to fossil fuels. Among the different forms of hydrogen yellow hydrogen stands out for its use of solar energy to power the electrolysis process that creates the clean fuel. While it remains a form of green hydrogen yellow hydrogen is a more specific designation to clarify precisely what form of renewable electricity is used to power the process. Yellow hydrogen is increasing in popularity as countries seek H2 with zero carbon emissions. However primary challenges associated with this renewable form of energy include the cost of production when compared to fossil fuel and determining how to recycle solar panels when they reach the end of their lifecycles. Despite these challenges yellow hydrogen is seen as one of the cleanest alternatives to using fossil fuels and offers hope for a sustainable future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRoaW5ncy5jb20vdmVudXMtYW5kLXNlcmVuYS13aWxsaWFtcy1zaWJsaW5ncy1yZWxhdGlvbnNoaXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Venus And Serena's Other Siblings Really Think Of Their Success,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRoaW5ncy5jb20vdmVudXMtYW5kLXNlcmVuYS13aWxsaWFtcy1zaWJsaW5ncy1yZWxhdGlvbnNoaXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Most of the $9-$10 billion that Xcel Energy will spend in the next few years will be spent on Colorado’s eastern plains. Why is this such a big deal for Colorado?

Colorado will soon embark on a change with few rivals in the last 100 years. Think of the dismantling of geography by construction of Interstate 70 through the tunnels over Vail Pass and through Glenwood Canyon. Think of Denver International Airport. Think of the arrival of electricity to farms and small towns in the 1930s and 1940s.

Within a decade Xcel Energy the state’s largest electrical utility will retire all its coal plants convert one to burn natural gas and add massive amounts of wind on Colorado’s eastern plains and solar generation some of it in the Western Slope’s Grand Valley along with batteries nad perhaps other storage as it pursues a mid-century goal of net-zero carbon. Combined with potentially 740 miles of new transmission lines looping around eastern Colorado this investment in new generation could hit $9 billion to $10 billion. Xcel will likely get its final green light from state regulators in the next month maybe two.

This has repercussions beyond Xcel Energy which sells more than half the electricity in Colorado. It also delivers wholesale sales to some municipalities and cooperatives including Holy Cross Energy Yampa Valley Electric and Grand Valley Power.

Is this money well spent? If you’re a climate hawk as I am convinced we must dramatically reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases this represents a giant step forward. We must immediately reduce emissions from electrical generation and also displace fossil fuels in transportation and buildings.

True China’s emissions keep growing. But Colorado can lead the United States by example and the United States can lead the world.

Some people even champions of this transition disagree with the precise pathway. For example if demand were shaved through energy efficiency and other programs will less investment in new generating resources be needed says Western Resource Advocates an environmental group.

From Colorado eastern plains already dotted with wind turbines come other complaints about cluttered skylines. This is not universal. Other plainsmen (and women) welcome the property taxes local governments will realize and the lease payments to land owners.

Nuclear power represents another question. Colorado’s lone experiment with nuclear power at the St. Vrain plant near Greeley went seriously awry. But now come efforts with presumably smaller and hence lower-risk modular reactors such as are being planned in Idaho and also Wyoming. Cost more than safety is the fulcrum for the debate. Nuclear has had exorbitant cost overruns. Will this new technology be better?

Comanche 3 a coal plant in Pueblo has become the symbol for this energy transition. It was approved 18 years ago by Colorado regulators a $1 billion investment (in today’s dollars). Utilities had been building ever-bigger coal-fired coal plants abetted by natural gas plants to meet peak demands for a half-century. Few were willing to give credence to the vision of renewable energy. I remember in about 2008 a geologist in Meeker who still hoped for the dream of milking hydrocarbons from the oil shale of northwestern Colorado. “We can’t run a civilization on windmills” he fumed.

We still can’t. And as somebody pointed out to me even wind turbines need oil and grease and so forth. But we can do far far more than Xcel or most others thought just 18 years ago.

This has come in increments. Almost simultaneous with approval of Comanche 3 came Colorado’s first renewable energy mandate. Xcel fought it. Then it set out to comply. Costs of wind tumbled dramatically and then so did solar. Something of the same thing is now happening with lithium-ion batteries.

It’s not yet possible on a large scale to affordably eliminate all emissions. But also note this. In 2005 when Xcel began building Comanche 3 about two-thirds of its electricity came from coal plants. Within a decade it will be close to zero. We’re moving fast because we can and because we must.

Will there be adverse consequences beyond altered prairie vistas on the Great Plains? Quite possibly. With I-70 what once was close to a full-day journey from Grand Junction to Denver was shortened to a long morning. But the highway has made mountain valleys a little less lovely and far more noisy.

This course correction in our energy foundation may also prove to have flaws that may require further altering. And in 18 years we may look back and wonder if we should have held off just a little longer for a technological breakthrough instead of making Colorado’s eastern plains look like Paul Bunyan’s playground for Erector Set creations.

What we cannot afford is to do nothing. Given what we know today about the cost of energy and the cost of climate change this massive investment soon to happen looks to be the wisest path forward.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL21pbm5lc290YS9uZXdzL2xpZ2h0bmluZy1zdHJpa2UtYmVsaWV2ZWQtdG8taGF2ZS1jYXVzZWQtbmF0dXJhbC1nYXMtZmlyZS1pbi1zdC1wYXVsL9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9taW5uZXNvdGEvbmV3cy9saWdodG5pbmctc3RyaWtlLWJlbGlldmVkLXRvLWhhdmUtY2F1c2VkLW5hdHVyYWwtZ2FzLWZpcmUtaW4tc3QtcGF1bC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lightning strike believed to have caused natural gas fire in St. Paul,"Lightning strike believed to be cause of natural gas fire in St. Paul

Lightning strike believed to be cause of natural gas fire in St. Paul

ST. PAUL Minn. -- A natural gas fire in St. Paul that officials believe was caused by a lightning strike was extinguished just before noon on Saturday.

The fire which was at Brainerd Avenue and Burr Street did not extend to homes in the area.

A preliminary investigation from St. Paul fire points to the cause coming from a lightning strike that may have hit a tree. Since there were no nearby homes crews allowed the free-flowing gas to burn out which is a typical procedure.

Crews evacuated nearby buildings and once Xcel Energy arrived at the scene they turned off the gas and the fire was extinguished around 11:40 a.m.

The stores have typically only concentrated in a few places The Wall Street Journal reported Friday (Aug. 5) but wealth has been expanding to new areas with cities like Atlanta Georgia and Austin Texas becoming more focused on tech.

Due to that rise in wealth luxury companies have looked to establish new locations expanding from the usual mainstays in New York and California.

The report noted that China’s stricter approach to COVID-19 has also encouraged more companies to expand in the U.S. diversifying their international efforts. Growth in the U.S. has driven luxury earnings for the first part of 2022 while Chinese sales lagged.

Luxury brands have been looking into U.S. expansion efforts despite warnings from mainstream retailers that the current economic crises including historic inflation could see customers cutting down on extraneous spending for the months ahead.

But luxury executives have said they think affluent customers will make up for the losses as they’re not as likely to cut back their spending per the report.

In other news related to luxury companies’ Chinese operations PYMNTS wrote that Burberry the British luxury fashion brand has closed its Hong Kong flagship store as many such brands step away from the country due to various restrictions.

But CEOs are split on how consumer behavior is changing and whether it's impacting their companies.

McDonald's Chris Kempczinski and Chipotle Mexican Grill's Brian Niccol are among those who told investors that low-income consumers are spending less money at their locations while higher-income customers are visiting more frequently. Other chief executives like Starbucks' Howard Schultz and Bloomin' Brands' David Deno said they haven't seen their customers pull back.

The mixed observations come as restaurant companies hike menu prices to pass along higher costs for ingredients and labor. Prices for food eaten away from home have risen 7.7% in the 12 months ended in June according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. People are also paying much more for necessities like gas toilet paper and groceries stoking worries about the possibility of a recession.

Historically pricier fast-casual and sit-own restaurant chains typically see sales deteriorate during slowdowns as people opt to stay home or pack their own lunches. Fast food tends to be the top-performing restaurant sector as people trade down to cheaper meals when looking to treat themselves.

More clues about how dining habits might be changing are in store next week when salad chain Sweetgreen  Applebee's owner Dine Brands and Dutch Bros Coffee report earnings.
