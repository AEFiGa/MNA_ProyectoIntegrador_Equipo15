A fifth of people living in northern England are prevented from participating in the opportunities and communities around them because of poor mobility and connectivity according to the report by the devolved government agency Transport for the North (TfN).

TfN in conjunction with Social Research Associates and Temple spoke to more than 3000 members of the public and experts from across the north to understand the effects of the transport system on everyday life.

Interviewees spoke about having to get taxis to work – which sometimes cost as much as they earned – as a consequence of unreliable public transport services; having to give themselves a buffer of an hour for everyday journeys because of erratic services; and missing important medical appointments when services failed to turn up with the result that they were sent to the back of the queue for treatment.

One participant in County Durham said: “I was called out several times recently to rescue my 80-year-old mother from the bus stop when the service was cancelled without warning or offer of help.”

Another based in Gateshead said: “There’s only one bus an hour and it didn’t turn up. The children were cold and hungry and we had no idea what was going to happen.”

A Northumberland schoolchild told researchers: “It takes two or three buses to get to school and it takes ages. It also means I can’t stay on for after-school activities and also reduced my choice for A-levels.”

Lord Patrick McLoughlin the chair of TfN said: “Over one in five people in the north are at risk of exclusion because of the limitations of transport options in their community. That is millions of people many of whom are those with specific needs who rely on public transport to get to work to go to medical appointments or to just see friends and family. This issue is holding the region back and must be addressed if we are to achieve our full potential.

CNN —

Wednesday night’s second season premiere of “Abbott Elementary” seemed a little … I don’t know what word works best … Flashier? Extravagant? Whatever it was it was more than what I’d been accustomed to expect from this modestly-apportioned chronicle of a fiscally challenged elementary school in South Philadelphia.

Gene Seymour Jeremy Freeman/CNN

Such I suppose are the spoils of success. It’s what happens when a warmhearted craftily intelligent prime-time sitcom manages in a year’s time to become one of the few broadcast-network series (in this era of streaming channels and cable blockbusters) to nail down both critical and popular acclaim – along with three Emmys.

Still as with the school’s doughty dorky and aggressively earnest second-year teacher Janine Teagues (the show’s Emmy-winning creator-producer star Quinta Brunson) the new season opener took me aback with the crowded tailgating barbecue in the school parking lot the week before the school year started.

Was there a game that day? Did it matter? Not to Ava Coleman (Janelle James) the school’s narcissistic absurdly underqualified principal who was in the middle of it all with full Eagles regalia and her customary obliviousness.

Also: how in the name of Philadelphia Flyers hockey legend Bobby Clarke did this show get Gritty the giant orange whatchamacallit who is the Flyers mascot as its opening night guest star?

Could this be an acknowledgment that “Abbott Elementary” has become not just a exemplar of contemporary television but a landmark of its city of origin? Like the Reading Terminal the Liberty Bell the statues of both William Penn and Rocky Balboa and the lovable if unkempt cheesesteak?

If so the show has earned its stature – and then some.

From the pilot episode that first aired last December (the one that Brunson won the Emmy for comedy scriptwriting) a savory vibe of – for want of a better word – “Philly”-ness has been evoked from every episode of “Abbott Elementary.” The language the sense of place the ethnic references class distinctions and yes those Eagles jerseys … all of them have been impeccably subtly weaved into the show’s overall design with the insight and compassion one would expect from Brunson a West Philadelphia-born-and-bred daughter of a kindergarten teacher.

I noticed this sensitivity from the jump. I have lived off and on in Philadelphia over the last 40 years and in this rough-hewn warmhearted often sentimental and always pugnacious city of neighborhoods strenuous means are required to get even the most basic stuff done.

In other words when seeking redress repairs supplies or anything else that can’t be obtained through “conventional” means a true Philadelphian asks around haggles mucks through back channels. After all of which you get whatever it is you’re after. Maybe. Probably.

Making do with less is a recurring theme in “Abbott Elementary.” The second season began after all with veteran kindergarten teacher Barbara Howard (Sheryl Lee Ralph) struggling to wrench from a recalcitrant school system a desk suitable enough for her first wheelchair-bound student. (The remarkable Ralph was rewarded with a supporting actress Emmy for her commanding and sometimes poignant performance as the stoic religious and pragmatic Barbara.)

Everybody on Abbott’s staff has to bypass regular channels to get what they need whether it’s crayons picture books or as in one episode last season a single egg. Janine hoped to hatch a baby chicken as an object lesson to her pupils on the Miracle of Life – it hatched all right … but it was more debacle than miracle (think reptiles).

For which Janine couldn’t blame her street-smart no-nonsense colleague Melissa Schemmenti (Lisa Ann Walter) who got the egg in a hurry through what everybody assumes were off-the-books “connections.” She didn’t know what was in the egg but that’s not her problem. And yet we’ve found out this week that Melissa’s problem this new year is suddenly needing to take on a surplus of extra third graders in what had been a second-grade class.

So it looks as if we’re going to find out how Melissa makes do with more as well as with less. But that’s part of what “Abbott’s” viewers have gotten used to: watching its characters grow improvise and surprise us. One thinks of Jacob Hill (Chris Perfetti) the school’s history teacher who at first seems the archetype of a well-meaning-but-klutzy White liberal but over time proves more nuanced and far savvier than Janine – and we – first suspect.

Tyler James Williams in ""Abbott Elementary"" Gilles Mingasson/ABC

More enigmatic but comparably engaging is Gregory Eddie (Tyler James Williams) a dryly reserved former substitute whose seeming diffidence barely conceals both his nascent romantic interest in Janine and his slow-burning displeasure with Ava’s blackmailing the school superintendent to get the job Greg covets. Now that he’s a full-time teacher maybe he’ll open up and calm down.

But with this staff it’s never wise to expect anything. If the series hadn’t been greenlit for a 13-episode season we wouldn’t have found that even Ava has her lurking insecurities – and a gift for choreographing step-dances. We’d have never met Barbara’s sophisticated adult daughter or Jacob’s gay lover. For that matter we wouldn’t have seen Jacob beat Melissa like a drum in poker or out-Double-Dutch Janine. And we certainly wouldn’t have found out that Mr. Johnson (William Stanford Davis) the school’s churlish custodian carried all these past lives including one as a US Olympian.

“Abbott Elementary” isn’t just a show about teaching but one that teaches you. And one of its lessons is not to understand anyone or anything too quickly but to give each person time and space to figure themselves – and each other – out.

Exhibit A is Janine herself who discovered in the season opener that all the gung-ho-raring-to-go swagger she’s bringing back to school with her isn’t enough to pull her through the emotional and financial debris of breaking up with her childhood sweetheart. Even Gritty had to give her a hug though everybody else around her knows she’ll need more than hugs in the coming weeks.

Which leads to yet another lesson the show teaches: take nothing for granted with people. They’re not always easy to take or figure out. But be willing to accept surprises whenever and wherever they come.

It’s not dissimilar to what “Ted Lasso” has been encouraging in its followers. And yet “Abbott Elementary” seems to be carrying the message with a stealth effect that’s at once airier and grittier than Apple TV+’s hit soccer comedy. I love them both but I think I’m rooting harder for the folks in the teachers’ lounge rather than the locker room to keep defying the odds.

Greg Abbott has a double-digit lead over Beto O’Rourke in North Texas in the race for governor according to a breakdown of voters in a new poll from The Dallas Morning News and the University of Texas at Tyler.

Abbott a Republican seeking a third term was ahead of O’Rourke by 54% to 35% in North Texas as defined by the state’s leading economic-development booster group — not just Dallas-Fort Worth but Sherman-Denison and Wichita Falls as well.

Mark Owens the poll’s director divided the survey’s respondents into each of the Texas Economic Development Corporation’s six regions to determine how Abbott and O’Rourke a former El Paso congressman were performing across the state.

Abbott’s strongest regions are the state’s most rural — East Texas where he’s running 44 percentage points ahead of O’Rourke; and West Texas where the Republican incumbent’s advantage is 23 points.

Among registered voters statewide Abbott leads O’Rourke 47% to 38%. Among Texans who said they are certain or likely to vote Abbott was ahead by 11 percentage points 50% to 39%.The poll conducted Sept. 6-13 surveyed 1268 registered voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points.

Abbott is counting on voters’ worries about inflation crime and the border — and the state’s continuing economic and population growth — to carry him to victory on Nov. 8.

O’Rourke is stoking a voter backlash against 20 years of total GOP domination of statewide offices and the Legislature.

Abbott’s not been a good steward of public schools public health and the power grid he says. O’Rourke also is hoping the May 24 school shooting in Uvalde and Texas’ virtual ban of abortion which kicked in on Aug. 25 will peel independents away from Abbott and bring Democrats who don’t usually vote in midterms to the polls.

In The News and UT-Tyler’s last two polls O’Rourke and Abbott have been almost evenly splitting independents. This month O’Rourke led among them 36%-35%; last month 34%-31%.

According to timezone-adjusted Nielsen Live + Same Day data Episode 1 of Season 2 averaged a 0.6 rating among adults ages 18-49 and 2.8 million total viewers making it ABC’s highest-rated show during Wednesday primetime.

That marks a solid start to the new school year for “Abbott Elementary” which put up a 0.6 rating and 2.8 million total viewers in the comparable Nielsen metrics for its Season 1 finale in April.

In fact the second season premiere of “Abbott” was actually able to stay even with its first season premiere which aired immediately after Jimmy Kimmel and Norman Lear’s third “Live in Front of a Studio Audience” special and garnered a 0.6 rating and 2.9 million total viewers.

Popular on Variety

And if the Nielsen performance for the second season of “Abbott” is anything like the first it’s going to keep growing outside of the “Live” window especially when it comes to bringing in its younger viewers: After 35 days of viewing across linear and digital platforms like Hulu “Abbott Elementary” Season 1 averaged 8.11 million total viewers and a 2.73 rating per ABC.

The first season of “Abbott Elementary” received seven Emmy nominations and took home three awards in total including one for creator and star Quinta Brunson for comedy writing one for the show’s casting and the other for supporting actress Sheryl Lee Ralph.

With an investment of 60 million euros ($59.3 million) in its site on the outskirts of Cork AbbVie will further grow its presence in the Emerald Isle. The expansion will pave the way for a new facility that will employ 70 in support of AbbVie’s aesthetics business.

The new roles will include sterile manufacturing quality control and engineering the company said

Construction will begin next year with manufacturing operations set to begin in 2025. The 20-year-old 14000-square foot site which is in the town of Carrigtwohill currently employs 150 and produces tablets and capsules.

In addition to offices in Dublin AbbVie has six manufacturing sites in the country with most of them growing.

In 2020 the year that AbbVie completed its Allergan buyout the companies opened a second facility in Westport to produce the blockbuster treatment Botox. The $176 million investment brought the sprawling site to 750000 square feet and 1400 employees.

Before that in 2018 AbbVie spent $139 million on an expansion of one of its two plants in Sligo. The investment was to increase the company’s capacity to produce cancer drugs. That splurge was on top of a $115 million outlay in 2014 to produce oral hepatitis C drugs in Sligo.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vcGhhcm1hcGhvcnVtLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZpcnN0LWh1bWFuLWRhdGEtYmFja3MtY2FsaWJyLWFiYnZpZXMtc3dpdGNoYWJsZS1jYXItdC10aGVyYXB50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"First human data backs Calibr/AbbVie's ""switchable"" CAR-T therapy","California biotech Calibr and partner AbbVie have reported the first clinical data on a new CAR-T technology which uses ""switchable"" cells that aim to eliminate the life-threatening side-effects that can occur with this type of immunotherapy.

Like other CAR-Ts Calibr's therapy is manufactured from a patient's own T-cells which are harvested and genetically modified to fight cancer before being reintroduced into the body. However they have a novel molecular switch – in this case an antibody – which activates them only when needed to avoid the side effects seen with this class.

CAR-Ts can sometimes cause cytokine release syndrome (CRS) when the immune system goes into overdrive and causes dangerous inflammation which means patients have to receive prophylactic immune-suppressing drugs that can limit the efficacy of treatment.

Scripps Research Institute spin-out Calibr's lead candidate combines CLBR001 cells – billed as a ""universal"" CAR-T because they are not targeted at a specific antigen – and companion antibody SWI019 which directs them to CD19 antigens on B-cell cancers. In the absence of the antibody the CAR-T cells are dormant.

The first readout from an ongoing phase 1 study reveals that out of nine patients treated to date seven (78%) showed a response to the treatment with six (67%) having a complete response with most responses coming after a single dose of the CAR-T and SWI019.

That remarkable level of efficacy – given that patients had already experienced around five prior lines of therapy – came without an increase in CRS or immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) another complication seen with current CAR-T therapies.

""Patients who experienced CRS or ICANS had shorter duration of these events compared with those in pivotal trials for commercial CAR-T cell products"" said Calibr in a statement.

The duration of those side effects was limited to around 2 to 3 days with the switchable therapy compared to five to 17 days with already-approved CD19-targeted CAR-Ts such as Novartis' Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) Gilead Sciences' Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) and Bristol-Myers Squibb's Breyanzi (lisocabtagene maraleucel).

There is also evidence that responses can be deepened with repeat administrations of the SWI019 antibody which deliberately has a relatively short half-life to minimise the risk of side effects said Calibr.

""These results underscore the potential of Calibr's switchable CAR-T cell platform to act like a 'software' and 'hardware' approach where the biological response of the CLBR001 cell 'hardware' can be programmed using the switch dose as the 'software'"" said Travis Young head of biologics at Calibr.

""This is our first step toward demonstrating the potential of this universal platform to be programmed toward any target including those for solid tumours"" he added.

So far conventional CAR-Ts have not been effective in treating solid tumours because of difficulties in targeting tumours surviving the hostile microenvironment around them and infiltrating them to exert their anti-cancer effects.

Calibr hopes its approach could however overcome those limitations with higher doses of targeting antibody or potentially multiple antibodies targeting different tumour-associated antigens.

AbbVie has been involved in the development of the switchable CAR-T platform since 2018 when it licensed the technology for various tumour targets in return for an undisclosed upfront fee. It has option to license some of Calibr's existing cell therapy programmes including CLBR001+ SWI019.

Other companies are also investigating ways to enhance the efficacy of CAR-Ts. Earlier this month for example BioNTech reported results with its ""amplified"" CAR-T BNT-211 for solid tumours which consists of cells directed at Claudin-6 on cancer cells coupled with an mRNA vaccine designed to amplify their activity.

UK start-up Leucid Bio meanwhile is developing CAR-Ts that are engineered in a more natural biological configuration that is designed to enhance their potency extend responses and reduce side effects.

Other research groups are using a similar switchable approach to activating the cells using triggers including small-molecule drugs viruses and even light and heat.

The pharma was inundated by nearly 20000 submissions but has now whittled those down to just 25 real people “of all forms genders ethnicities and backgrounds” it said in a press release. These 25 people are now the central part of AbbVie’s new ""See Yourself"" campaign for the cosmetic use of blockbuster Botox.

This campaign run as a video series is made up of intimate accounts from people speaking candidly about how they see themselves and their motivation for using Botox to help reduce frown lines. The newly released content includes testimonial footage and interviews with cast members before and after treatment (which are on YouTube) behind-the-scenes footage and self-filmed treatment diaries.

AbbVie found in a survey the pharma undertook last year that 83% of those who are considering using an aesthetic neurotoxin like Botox went on to use the product within a year something that AbbVie saw as showing “people are curious about aesthetic treatments and want to learn more” it said in the release.

So in addition to sharing their stories the cast also answered the 10 most common questions about Botox that people search online in what is called a “special content series” that will also appear online in the future.

“We were thrilled by the huge influx of responses we received to our open casting call in January of this year” said Carrie Strom senior vice president at AbbVie and president of Global Allergan Aesthetics in the release.

“It was moving to see how Botox Cosmetic continues to impact so many lives across the country. Our mission continues to be rooted in showing up authentically sharing candid sincere stories and content highlighting our real patients' reasons for getting treated and how they feel about treatment.”

AbbVie nabbed Allergan and Botox in a $63 billion merger that was signed off on back in 2020.

The Big Pharma's latest campaign comes amid an upsurge in Botox marketing and a growing list of rivals that want to take a bite out of this market which Botox currently leads. It made $5.3 billion in sales last year though Botox also has several medical approvals.

Among AbbVie's competitors is Evolus which got anti-wrinkle treatment Jeuveau approved in 2019. Analysts see Jeuveau as a $2 billion-a-year product at peak. Evolus revealed its campaign—“Switch Your Tox and Love Evolus Forever”—in July with a focus on getting consumers to move from Botox to its product which marks the first new neurotoxin approved for cosmetic purposes in 12 years.

There is also similar rival drug in the form of Revance’s daxibotulinumtoxinA. But the company has been hit with not one but two manufacturing citations the latest coming just last month; however it got a swift and surprising FDA approval in this month under the brand name Daxxify.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaG5pY2FsLmx5L3N0YXJ0dXBzL3dpdGgtYS1wZW5kaW5nLTMwbS1pbnZlc3RtZW50LWNhcmlzbWEtdGhlcmFwZXV0aWNzLW1lcmdlcy13aXRoLWJvc3Rvbi1iYXNlZC1zZXNlbi1iaW8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With a pending $30M investment Carisma Therapeutics merges with Boston-based Sesen Bio,"Though Philly has long been establishing itself as a hub for the life sciences one local biotech company is working with a Boston competitor to combine the companies in an all-stock transaction.

Philly-based biotech firm Carisma Therapeutics will merge with Boston-based Sesen Bio the companies announced Wednesday. Together they’ll form one clinical-stage biotech company aiming to advance engineer macrophages for the treatment of cancer and other serious disorders. The combined company will operate under Carisma’s name.

Carisma also brings a tentative $30 million investment to the deal secured from a syndicate of investors including Penn Medicine HealthCap AbbVie Wellington Partners SymBiosis TPG Biotech MRL Ventures Fund the therapeutics-focused corporate venture arm of Merck & Co. Agent Capital Solasta Livzon Pictet Alternative Advisors and 4Bio. The round is expected to close with the completion of the merger in the next three to four months the companies said.

With that capital the combined company is expected to have approximately $180 million in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities which will help move Carisma through ongoing data readouts across several clinical trials. It will also fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through 2024.

“This transaction represents the result of a thoughtful and careful review of strategic alternatives over the past four months during which Carisma’s clinical programs management team and corporate strategy stood out amongst the 42 bids reviewed” Thomas Cannell president and CEO of Sesen Bio said in a statement.

The combined company will focus on advancing Carisma’s proprietary cell therapy platform that uses engineered macrophages and monocytes to potentially evolve the treatment of cancer and other serious disorders. Carisma is trying the development of chimeric antigen receptor macrophage (CAR-M) therapies and is “believed to be the only company developing CAR-M therapies with demonstrated proof of mechanism and safety data in clinical trials” it said.

“The proposed merger represents an exciting opportunity for shareholders of each company and we believe it gets us one step closer to our goal of revolutionizing the field of immunotherapy” Steven Kelly president and CEO of Carisma said in a statement. “This transaction will provide us with financial strength to not only continue to develop our lead candidate CT-0508 but also allow us to accelerate the growth of our platform and pipeline within and outside of oncology and develop additional strong strategic partnerships beyond those we already have with Moderna and Novartis.”

The Philly company recently joined a strategic partnership with Moderna for the discovery development and commercialization of in vivo (in-human) CAR-M therapies for up to 12 targets for the treatment of cancer. Carisma received a $45 million up-front cash payment and an investment by Moderna in the form of a $35 million convertible note for the project which will convert into shares of common stock of the combined company in connection with the merger.

AbbVie a global research and development-based biopharmaceutical company with a significant presence across eight Irish locations today announced a €60m investment at its manufacturing site in Cork.

The expansion which will include the development of a new state-of-the-art facility will create approximately 70 new jobs. New technologies will be introduced to the site in Carrigtwohill which will allow it to support AbbVie’s aesthetics business.

AbbVie will also leverage the expansion to introduce new technology and upgrades that will improve the carbon footprint of the wider Cork site.

Construction will commence in 2023 with manufacturing operations scheduled to begin in 2025.

In addition to the multimillion-euro investment announced today AbbVie is also embarking on a three-year strategic training programme at the Carrigtwohill facility. The initiative is supported by the Government through the IDA and will enhance and develop key workforce skills to support incoming new technologies.

The Carrigtwohill plant celebrates its 20th anniversary in November and currently employs approximately 150 people. The €60m announcement brings AbbVie’s total investment at the location since the company’s inception in 2013 to approximately €177m.

Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment Leo Varadkar said: “This multi-million investment by AbbVie is brilliant news. It’s a fantastic opportunity for Cork with the creation of 70 high value jobs in Carrigtwohill. AbbVie has been in Ireland since 1974 and now has eight locations across the country. Ireland is a world hub for life sciences and we’ve worked hard to create a welcoming environment for companies. This investment will reduce the carbon footprint at the Cork site and is setting a good example for the broader sector. I thank AbbVie for its continued investment in our country and I wish the team all the very best with this expansion.”

“AbbVie traces its heritage in Ireland back to 1974 and is a company with a very strong presence all around the country. It is helping create high-quality career opportunities here in Cork and has plants and office hubs in Dublin but AbbVie also successfully manufactures innovative medicines for global supply at locations far from traditional pharma hubs on the west coast of Ireland at Westport in County Mayo and in Sligo.

“It is great news to see a Cork plant that is already celebrating its 20th anniversary further enhance its capability and potential within the AbbVie Irish and global network through the imminent addition of new technologies and skills.”

Commenting on the announcement Malcolm Garde Site Director AbbVie Cork said: “This latest investment is a fantastic opportunity for the Cork site and a recognition of the expertise and commitment of our dedicated employees over the past 20 years. The expansion and associated cutting-edge technologies will help us to further develop our employees and attract new skilled talent.”

IDA Ireland CEO Martin Shanahan said: “This latest investment by AbbVie is a testament to Ireland being an attractive and supportive location for continued investment by established companies. Marking two decades of successful operations at its manufacturing site in Carrigtwohill by making a further €60 million investment creating 70 additional jobs is a strong endorsement and demonstrates a clear commitment to the company’s Cork site.

It’s a very significant day for a plant that already has a long and proud record of pharmaceutical manufacturing and innovation. IDA Ireland is delighted to partner with AbbVie in creating these opportunities for new employees who will help write the next chapter in its story.”

The 70 new roles will be spread across various areas including sterile manufacturing quality control and engineering.

AbbVie employs approximately 2600 people at seven other locations across Ireland including Sligo Mayo and Dublin."

Accenture delivered a strong set of full year 2022 results with revenues increasing year-over-year and the size of deals increasing over the 12 month period. CEO Julia Sweet acknowledged that the macroeconomic climate is uncertain but highlighted that Accenture is delivering on the enterprise priorities for its customers.

The key full year numbers are:

Revenues for the full 2022 fiscal year were $61.6 billion compared with $50.5 billion for fiscal 2021 an increase of 22% in U.S. dollars and 26% in local currency. Revenues for fiscal 2022 reflect a foreign-exchange impact of approximately negative 4% compared with fiscal 2021.

New bookings for the full fiscal year were $71.7 billion an increase of 21% in U.S. dollars and 25% in local currency from fiscal 2021.

Accenture’s business outlook for the full 2023 fiscal year assumes that the foreign-exchange impact on its results in U.S. dollars will be approximately negative 6% compared with fiscal 2022. For fiscal 2023 the company expects revenue growth to be in the range of 8% to 11% in local currency.

CEO Sweet added some colour to the numbers highlighting the increase in size of Accenture’s larger accounts its focus on acquisitions and R&D as well as how it is investing in the workforce. She said:

In FY '22 we delivered record bookings of $72 billion. As our clients continue to execute compressed transformations we had 100 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million compared to $72 million last fiscal year. We delivered revenues of $62 billion representing a record 26% growth in local currency adding $11 billion in revenue for the year. We continue to take significant market share growing more than 2x the market. Our financial results reflect our commitment to creating value for our clients every day which is why they are turning to us as their trusted partner across the enterprise. We achieved this profitable growth while continuing to invest significantly in our business and people with $3.4 billion deployed across 38 acquisitions that are well balanced across markets services and strategic priorities; $1.1 billion invested in R&D assets platforms and industry solutions including growing our portfolio of patents and pending patents to more than 8300; and $1.1 billion invested in the training and development of our people to grow the skills needed to serve our clients. We continue to offer an employee value proposition that includes providing vibrant career paths and opportunities for our people with approximately 157000 promotions and over 40 million training hours while expanding our workforce by almost 100000 and achieving 47% women as we continue our progress towards gender parity by 2025.

An uncertain environment

Sweet didn’t shy away from the concern in the market around the macroeconomic environment - including inflation supply chain woes looming recessions and pressures on sourcing and retaining talent. However she said that despite this backdrop Accenture still delivered $18.4 billion in new bookings in Q4 a year-over-year increase of 31% in local currency.

Sweet added that Accenture’s in a good position to thrive given its position and the trends it is seeing with enterprise customers. In particular buyers are focused on technology procurement and quick return to value outcomes. She said;

While industries and markets are being affected differently there are two common themes: all strategies lead to technology particularly cloud data AI and security which are fundamental to its strong digital core. Our cloud business is now $26 billion and grew 48% with Cloud First being the biggest driver of the growth. Companies are also seeking to execute compressed transformations the second theme. These mean bold programs on accelerated time frames often spanning multiple parts of the enterprise at the same time. Managed services have become increasingly strategic as companies seek to move faster and leverage our digital platform and talent and they are turning to Accenture because of our excellence across the enterprise. We are unmatched in terms of breadth and depth of capabilities and industry coverage. We continue to see a growing number of companies embrace the need to harness the five key forces of change that we have identified for the next decade. Total enterprise reinvention talent sustainability the Metaverse Continuum and the ongoing tech revolution which in turn will fuel our growth.

‘Technology is at the core of strategy and so we‘re expecting to have a continued tight labor market and we’re continuing… to really excel’ says Julie Sweet Accenture CEO. ‘Despite that market even this last year we added 100000 people so the fact that there‘s been some layoffs in certain markets isn’t really I think going to change much.’

Accenture CEO Julie Sweet

Despite the macroeconomic environment inflation and hiring shortages Accenture CEO Julie Sweet said the Dublin-based solutions provider continues to excel when it comes to the talent supply chain.

“Technology is at the core of strategy and so we’re expecting to have a continued tight labor market and we’re continuing… to really excel” Sweet said during Accenture’s FY22 fourth quarter earnings call Thursday. “Despite that market even this last year we added 100000 people so the fact that there’s been some layoffs in certain markets isn’t really I think going to change much.”

Accenture has what Sweet called an integrated talent control tower that is able to predict earlier and earlier in their sales cycle where the skills will be needed and what type of skills.

“For us this is just normal business” she said. “Technology demand is really incredible. All strategies lead to technology and we‘re super pleased with not only our performance there but what we’re seeing ahead as clients continue to build the digital core as fundamental to all of their other strategic needs. Our talent supply chain is able to see that predict it understand the skills and keep moving forward.”

Accenture reported a revenue increase of 15 percent to $15.4 billion for the fourth quarter. For the full fiscal year Accenture reported revenues of $61.6 billion a record increase of 22 percent.

KC McClure Accenture’s chief financial officer said the company was able to grow and scale profitably while managing the wage inflation throughout the year.

“We do expect wage inflation to continue and we have factored that into our guidance” McClure said during the earnings call.

During the Q&A portion of the call a question was asked about inflation macroeconomics and how it will affect Accenture going forward.

McClure said the company continues to see “really strong demand” for services.

“The most recent estimate for IT services continues to show the growth for our industry will be about five percent” she said. “We’re calling for double-digit growth at the top part of our range and another year of double-digit growth which would have us adding significant scale yet again on top of our current $62 billion business.”

Sweet said when Accenture thinks about the macroeconomic climate the company thinks about what clients need.

“This environment affects different industries differently” she said. “You’ve got those who are really tied to the supply chain disruption and the inflation and continuing to focus on cost. It makes all clients really think about ‘OK what‘s my resilience? Is there more than I can do? Can I take advantage of the environment to push through deeper cost cuts that require you to change behaviors?’”

That makes Accenture think about what they need to pivot to help client needs similarly to what they did during the pandemic she said.

“It’s always an opportunity to better serve our clients” she added.

For its fourth quarter EPS increased by 17 percent to $10.71 for the full fiscal year. Free cash flow was $3.6 billion for the fourth quarter and a record $8.8 billion for the full year.

New bookings were $18.4 billion for the fourth quarter and a record $71.7 billion for the full year a 21 percent increase from the previous year.

For fiscal year 2023 Accenture expects revenue growth of 8 percent to 11 percent in local currency. The company’s fiscal year ends on Aug. 31.

Accenture has also been on an acquiring spree since the summer. Its most recent acquisition came Thursday with the acquisition of Inspirage a Bellevue Wash.-based IT services company. Inspirage will bring along its 710 employees to join the Accenture Oracle Business Group to further enhance Oracle’s supply chain skills and expand its capabilities to help product-centric clients create intelligent and innovative supply chain networks.

It generally consists of some combination of mud and straw pressed into bricks. In the United States adobe buildings are most common in the southwest – including far West Texas towns like Marfa Fort Davis and Presidio.

In recent years however the material’s prevalence and the region’s growing popularity as a vacation spot have changed the value of adobe construction. Sterry Butcher a writer for Texas Monthly and an adobe home resident in Marfa spoke to the Texas Standard about the political dimensions of adobe.

Sterry Butcher: Yeah I think it was 1996. My husband Michael and I had met in Marfa a few years prior to that. One day I woke up out of the blue ether and I thought ‘if we’re ever going to buy a house it needs to be right this instant.’ And those were good instincts. We bought a house with all the money that we had saved to go to graduate school and it was $9500 and it was just a shell of a house. It could hardly be called a house but it was ours and we loved it and we worked on it for a long time.

And the beauty it was made of adobe. So a lot of the repair work you could do right?

That’s right. It was made of adobe. And neither while Michael nor I had any previous building experience with adobe people just came out of the woodwork to say ‘oh well you know I’ve got some bricks of a falling down old building at my place. You could use some bricks to fill that hole.’

Well this speaks to just how common it is to build with adobe in West Texas right?

Yeah Marfa has about 1059 houses and half of them are adobe.

Well of course the days when you could buy an adobe house in Marfa for under $10000 those are long gone. But how did adobe become a controversial subject in Marfa?

Well over time Marfa has gone from being a little ranching community. But over time there is also an art presence here and that drew lots of new people to town. People were just really drawn to that sort of mix of ranching and high art. And over time more and more folks just started buying houses many of them as second homes. These turned into vacation rentals. So you know Marfa really had cache as just a neat place to be. And these adobe houses sort of spoke to the authenticity of the community. Many of them are not fancy. They kind of are what they are. There is a real appeal in that in these thick walls and these square rooms and this kind of lack of adornment that they have.

But now there’s a push to what increase taxes on adobe houses? What exactly is going on?

Well what started to happen was back in about 2014 the state comptroller’s office noticed that the appraisal district’s valuation on Marfa houses were actually quite a bit lower than the market value. People back then might be paying 150 200 $300000 for a house that was valued by the appraisal district at 40 or 60 or $80000. The state comptroller’s office told the appraisal district ‘you all have got to make those two figures match up more.’ And so they started to raise the valuations accordingly. And then in 2017 they really were thinking about it and a consultant for the appraisal district realized that adobe homes really seemed more prized by buyers than homes made of any other material. So in their valuations adobes were valued higher than houses made out of masonry or concrete block or frame.

Despite the fact that a lot of people bought these homes thinking well they’re basically mud homes. I mean you know they were considered rather simple structures.

Yes. And you know of course most of Marfa’s adobes were built before about 1931 often by the families who occupied them. So yeah you had these people who were generationally here many of them a majority of them in fact folks who were Mexican-American and then living in these simple yet lovely structures. And all of a sudden they’re being bought up by folks most of whom are from out of town as second homes and driving the values way way up.

Yeah exactly. Driving the values up and that of course means more when it comes to property tax. And as we all know property tax is rather high in Texas what without a general income tax. So how are locals pushing back against the idea of taxing adobe at this higher rate or are they?

Well that first year in 2017 I think fully 85% of the people who owned adobe houses in Marfa they protested their tax valuations and to varying degrees of success. Those tax protests that happen every summer they continue to happen. What’s interesting is really within the last year or so folks who are coming in to buy properties in Marfa they’re starting to care slightly less about adobe although it is still preferred but they also just want a house to move into whether it’s made of concrete block or wood. So valuations on other houses in Marfa are really coming close to those that are valued as adobes. You know my family owns two little very modest long-term rent houses that are frame. Those valuations went up by more than 100% this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZ3JlYXRzcGVjdWxhdGlvbnMvMjAyMi8wOS8yMy9hZG9iZS1zdG9jay1sb3N0LTIzLWluLW9uZS13ZWVrLXdoYXRzLW5leHQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adobe Stock Lost 23% In One Week What's Next?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2022/09/23/adobe-stock-lost-23-in-one-week-whats-next/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZ3JlYXRzcGVjdWxhdGlvbnMvMjAyMi8wOS8yMy9hZG9iZS1zdG9jay1sb3N0LTIzLWluLW9uZS13ZWVrLXdoYXRzLW5leHQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8yMi9ob3ctYWRvYmUtYW5kLXNhbGVzZm9yY2UtYXJlLWZpbmUtdHVuaW5nLWN1c3RvbWVyLWV4cGVyaWVuY2UtdG9vbHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Adobe and Salesforce are fine-tuning customer experience tools,"It was a big week for the customer experience market with two major players in the marketing tool space taking swings to bring the idea to the next level. The pair of moves taken together could move customer experience closer to reality after a long period of ambition.

“Customer experience” is kind of a vague notion. The idea is that you want your customers to feel good every time they interact with you whether in person or online. You certainly know when that doesn’t work well but it can be more subtle than simply a big smile in person or a successful outcome online. It’s more about taking the extra step to get ahead of problems before they happen or designing a product in an elegant way to reduce friction.

It seems that with all the data we have about customers these days companies should be doing better at generating positive experiences. In fact there is so much data from so many sources that companies like Adobe and Salesforce have created customer data platforms (or CDPs for short) to pull all of that data into one place with the goal of delivering optimal customer experiences based on the knowledge you have collected about customers.

Two of the biggest companies involved in gathering and using this data are Salesforce and Adobe. While Adobe doesn’t have a CRM it certainly has marketing tools and its $20 billion purchase of Figma was all about designing great products which ultimately should lead to a better customer experience.

At the same time at Dreamforce this week Salesforce’s annual customer conference in San Francisco the CRM giant announced a new approach to data integration on a platform called Genie. While it works in conjunction with the platform of tools itself and with external partners like Snowflake and Amazon the ultimate goal is to use the massive amounts of customer data to generate the best customer experiences possible at the moment they’re needed.

Designing great products is a start

While Adobe is best known for its creative tools like Photoshop and Illustrator the company also has an enterprise arm that includes tools aimed at marketers. Before it bought Figma last week Adobe bought marketing automation software firm Marketo in 2018 and e-commerce software Magento earlier that year. It was all part of an effort to beef up its marketing platform.

It announced a customer data platform the following year. All of this activity was about building a set of tools that work in tandem to deliver … wait for it … a good customer experience. Adobe’s angle is to develop marketing and sales materials with the creative tools and combine that with advertising and marketing campaigns. Now the company has the premier product design tool in the market on top of those other capabilities.

If you think about how the tools work together it’s all about attracting customers gathering data then building great products based on the data you have collected — or at least that’s the theory.

Sheryl Kingstone an analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence said it’s a matter of connecting the customer data to the actual business but that’s not always easy to do.

“If we embrace it if we really understand the importance of the first-party data that’s driving this and if we’re able to architect the use cases to be more proactive and hopefully eliminate as much as possible what humans need to do [we can deliver better experiences]” she said.

Certainly Adobe’s chief product officer Scott Belsky sees the connection between customer and digital experience and how businesses are being designed on Figma.

“I don’t think anyone realizes how big that market will be. I think that Figma will be the source of truth for every product that every company ships to their customers every digital experience” he said. And that means for every customer experience wherever it happens.

Salesforce releases the Genie

While both companies share a marketing product catalog Salesforce is less about the design part of it and more about the customer itself with the end game being improving that nebulous customer experience.

When it announced Genie this week it wasn’t so much a single product even though the company loves to productize platform components as it did with artificial intelligence calling it Einstein.

Genie is similar in some ways to Einstein in that it’s more a set of technologies designed to shift data wherever it’s needed. (Genie includes the CDP a new data lake purpose-built to move customer data more efficiently the company’s own Hyperforce architecture and other elements.) Ideally that speed gives you immediate knowledge to deliver whatever the customer desires.

Liz Miller an analyst at Constellation Research said the comparison between Einstein and Genie isn’t necessarily a perfect one. Einstein she said is really designed with transactional data in mind but when you combine it with Genie it becomes less about the system of record and more about a system of engagement.

“The real value of a CDP is its ability to bring structure and usability for what for years felt impossible connecting the dark dirty big (insert your word of choice for that firehose of data we’ve been desperately trying to drink from) that our customers and our engagements create” Miller said in an email. “That data exhaust can’t and shouldn’t be housed in CRM. But it can’t go ignored.”

She said when you combine the CDP with the data lake and throw in Einstein and Flow you begin to address how to take advantage of that data exhaust in a much more powerful way.

“Salesforce is following through on that promise of the entire customer-facing brand engaging with that market of one with relevance and contextual personalization that can be delivered at the right time for the customer and the person charged with delivering that moment” Miller explained. If Salesforce can truly deliver that it would bring real-time customized experiences much closer to reality.

It’s worth noting that startups have tried attacking different parts of the customer experience problem. Companies like Qualtrics which looks at customer sentiment was acquired by SAP in 2018 for $8 billion before being spun out a couple of years later. Then there’s Segment which was going after the CDP which was acquired by Twilio for $3.2 billion in 2020 and then of course there’s Figma being plucked by Adobe.

Wherever there is some innovation to improve customer experience it seems one of the platform players goes and buys it.

As for this week’s news tons of money and resources have been spent by these two companies with the goal of delivering truly great customer experiences even if they went at it from very different angles. Now we’ll see if they can actually deliver on building better experiences or if it’s just another step on the journey.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhc3Rjb21wYW55LmNvbS85MDc5MTkxMy93aGF0LXRoZS1hZG9iZS1maWdtYS1kZWFsLXNheXMtYWJvdXQtdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS1vZi1kZWVwLWNvbGxhYm9yYXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What the Adobe-Figma deal says about the future of deep collaboration,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.fastcompany.com/90791913/what-the-adobe-figma-deal-says-about-the-future-of-deep-collaboration/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhc3Rjb21wYW55LmNvbS85MDc5MTkxMy93aGF0LXRoZS1hZG9iZS1maWdtYS1kZWFsLXNheXMtYWJvdXQtdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS1vZi1kZWVwLWNvbGxhYm9yYXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen
AMD,Advanced Micro Devices,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vc3RvY2tuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FtZC1zdG0teHBlci1hdmdvLXVtYy10aW1lLXRvLWJ1eS1hbWQtc3RvY2stbm90LXNvLWZhc3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMD: Time to Buy AMD Stock? Not so Fast...,"Amid escalating geo-political tensions the Biden administration has decided to implement new restrictions on U.S. exports of semiconductor chips and chipmaking equipment to China. According to Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) new license requirements prevent the shipment of its MI250 chips to China. While the company doesn’t see any consequent material impact the stock has hit its 52-week low in recent trades on deteriorating investor sentiment.

Moreover AMD lost 25.1% over the past month and 51.7% year-to-date to close the last trading session at $68.43. However it might not be wise to scope up AMD shares right now as it may not have bottomed out yet.

Here is what could shape AMD’s performance in the near term:

Bleak Bottom Line Performance

For the second quarter that ended June 25 2022 AMD’s net revenue came in at $6.55 billion up 70.1% year-over-year. However its operating income came in at $526 million down 36.7% year-over-year. Its net income came in at $447 million down 37% year-over-year while its EPS came in at $0.27 down 53.4% year-over-year.

Stretched Valuations

In terms of its forward EV/S AMD’s 4.48x is 80.4% higher than the industry average of 2.48x. Its forward EV/EBITDA of 12.86x is 8.1% higher than the industry average of 11.90x. Also its forward P/S of 4.28x is 75.9% higher than the industry average of 2.43x. In addition its forward Price/Cash Flow of 16.84x is 4.2% higher than the industry average of 16.15x.

Trading Below Moving Averages

AMD is trading below its 50-day moving average of $88.77 and its 200-day moving average of $104.16 indicating a downtrend.

POWR Ratings Reflect Bleak Prospects

AMD has an overall rating of D equating to Sell in our proprietary POWR Rating system. The POWR Ratings are calculated by considering 118 different factors with each factor weighted to an optimal degree.

Our proprietary rating system also evaluates each stock based on eight distinct categories. AMD has a C grade for Growth consistent with its mixed financials in the last reported quarter.

In addition it has a D grade for Stability in sync with its beta of 1.97.

In the 93-stock Semiconductor & Wireless Chip industry AMD is ranked #84.

Bottom Line

AMD has been hitting its 52-week low recently indicating declining investor sentiment. Moreover given the lingering supply chain issues and declining demand the semiconductor market is expected to decline by 6% in 2023. This along with the new chip exporting restrictions could lead to AMD losing further. So it may not be wise to scope up its shares now.

How Does Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Stack Up Against its Peers?

While AMD has an overall POWR Rating of D one might consider looking at its industry peers STMicroelectronics N.V. (STM) Xperi Holding Corporation (XPER) and Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) which have an overall A (Strong Buy) rating and United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) which has an overall B (Buy) rating.

AMD shares were trading at $68.39 per share on Friday afternoon down $1.11 (-1.60%). Year-to-date AMD has declined -52.47% versus a -21.64% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

The Lancaster Area Battery (LAB) was built adjacent to the Luna energy storage project was also brought online in September by AES and was the first entirely debt-financed standalone large-scale project. The two energy projects capture and store energy supplied from 18 nearby AES solar projects.

AES is the world leader in battery energy storage and the fifth-largest solar developer globally. Other notable projects from the company included launching India’s first grid-scale energy storage project commissioning the first global virtual reservoir and becoming the first U.S. publicly-traded energy company to issue a Climate Scenario Report that complied with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations.

The U.S. energy company also has two liquid natural gas terminals in Panama and the Dominican Republic that were the first to provide cleaner-burning natural gas as an option in driving lower emissions as well as reduced electricity costs for residents. According to the AES website the Dominican Republic has cut 4 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions in the conversion from oil to imported petroleum products. It’s a major step and the first in a green energy transition that could possibly lead to renewable energy inclusion down the road.

On the solar side AES and the Kaua’i Island Cooperative (KIUC) completed the world’s first DC-coupled solution the Lāwa’i Solar and Energy Storage Project the largest solar-plus-storage system globally. The system can capture and deliver reliable carbon-free power that can be dispatched at any time to one of the most expensive electricity regions in the U.S. due to the island’s reliance on imported fossil fuels.

“Now that the Lāwa’i project is online as much as 40% of our evening peak power will be supplied by stored solar energy. I think it’s safe to say this is a unique achievement in the nation and possibly the world. Replacing fossil fuels with stable lower-priced renewables helps us keep rates as low as possible for our members” said David Bissell KIUC president and CEO.

AES was also named in the top 10 list (AES was number seven) on Fast Company’s 2022 Ranking of Best Workplaces for Innovators for its work in clean energy and driving new ideas for cutting-edge clean energy tech.

“Innovation is at the heart of our mission to accelerate the future of energy” said Andres Gluski AES President and CEO in the press release. “At AES we foster innovation at all levels of our organization and invest in transformative new businesses. With that approach we have seen tremendous returns on investment. Our employee-generated initiatives drive the overall growth and success of our company and make AES one of the world’s top workplaces for innovators.”

Capturing the Energy Transition Through AES

The KraneShares Global Carbon Transformation ETF (KGHG) focuses on the global industry leaders like AES which is carried at a 3.88% weighting within the fund that are pushing the global transition to net-zero emissions. KraneShares believes that the upside potential of investing in these companies as they transition is enormous.

The fund seeks to capture the true potential within the carbon transition by focusing on companies from within industries that are traditionally some of the highest emission offenders but that are on the precipice of transitioning to renewable technologies. These companies that are set to disrupt their industries would benefit greatly from being leaders in the transition as the cost of carbon emissions will only become more expensive cutting into the bottom line as demand decreases for high emissions offenders.

KGHG is an actively managed fund that invests globally across market caps and sectors in carbon emissions reducers that are taking active steps to reduce their carbon footprints and services or the carbon footprints of other companies. This also includes companies within the supply chain of the carbon-reducing companies and companies that are growing their businesses with companies that are materially reducing carbon emissions.

The fund utilizes proprietary fundamental bottom-up analysis using information disclosed by companies and third-party data.

KGHG carries an expense ratio of 0.89%.

This increase in production along with factors such as uncontrolled urbanization and the lack of appropriate waste management and recycling methods leads to the accumulation of waste in the environment which causes irreversible environmental damages1. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) the production of fruits and vegetables in the world is more than 1.74 billion tons of which 10–50 percent of it is wasted in different countries. The value of food waste in the world is estimated at US$ 1 trillion annually. The resources used to produce that amount of wasted food are responsible for the emission of 4.4 gigatons of greenhouse gases (equivalent to CO 2 ) per year making wasted food the third-largest producer of greenhouse gases in the world after China and the United States2.

The extent of food losses varies at different stages of the production chain depending on the type of product the level of economic development and the social and cultural conditions in a geographical area. In the case of fruits and vegetables according to the FAO study wastage in the harvesting sorting and grading stages is predominant in industrial areas. In developing areas while food loss is high during the harvesting sorting and grading stages the amount of wastage during the processing stage (14–21%) is much higher than in developed areas (less than 2%)23. This is while most fruit products are processed before consumption so in addition to increasing the value also maintains the quality and number of fruits on the market4. Large amounts of waste are accumulated during the processing which imposes high costs for treatments to reduce environmental detriment56. Thus fruit processing waste not only accounts for significant amounts of food waste which means serious environmental damage but also indicates the loss of nutrients of high value7. Therefore the conversion of waste into value-added products is important and necessary to improve the sustainability and efficiency of the food supply chain8.

Over the years in numerous studies the production of value-added products through microbial conversion or enzymatic processes of fruit wastes such as enzymes bioethanol organic acids heteropolysaccharides aromatic compounds protein-fortified feed prebiotic oligosaccharides and bioactive compounds has been investigated9. Microbial processing of residual fruit fibers is a relatively new approach that uses waste as monomers for the synthesis of natural beneficial oligomers10.

In general the structure of the fruit is composed of various compounds with different properties. After water the highest abundance belongs to carbohydrates which make up 50 to 80% of the dry weight in most fruits11. A large number of carbohydrates in fruit waste are types of dietary fiber of which pectin makes up to 40% of the compounds12. Pectins are a family of high molecular weight acidic polysaccharides which are abundant in the primary cell wall of plants made primarily from d-galacturonic acid units in the main chain with α (1-4) linkage along with small amounts of rhamnose in the main chain and arabinose galactose and xylose in the side chains1013. Several studies have demonstrated the applications of pectin in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Studies have suggested that short-chain pectins have wider applications such as prebiotic anti-cancer agents drug delivery systems radical scavenging properties cholesterol-lowering etc. and those features are related to the structure and molecular weight of pectic compounds1014.

Radical species are associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) asthma diabetes inflammation cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction. Synthetic antioxidants commonly used in manufacturing processes are considered to be the cause of cytotoxicity. On the other hand natural polysaccharides are considered to be reliable antioxidants that can scavenge free radicals and overcome synthetic substances that pose health concerns. The compounds rich in rhamnogalacturonan I as well as the compounds consisting of homogalacturonan in the main chain and rhamnogalacturonan I and arabinogalactan in the side chains show the highest level of antioxidant properties; Therefore the antioxidant properties of pectic compounds can be traced to the structure of rhamnogalacturonan I homogalacturonan and arabinogalactan15. Oligogalacturonic acids derived from pectin modified by various treatments also can purify compounds including anion superoxide hydroxyl and reactive oxygen species. They also increase the antioxidant properties of enzymes: superoxide dismutase catalase and glutathione peroxidase and show antioxidant properties by increasing the amount of glutathione16.

Another promising biological activity of pectin is its potential role in preventing and reducing carcinogenesis. The positive effects of “modified pectin” whether in the form of commercial products such as modified citrus pectin (e.g. GCS-100 FPP or pectasol) or laboratory-modified pectin have been studied and proven. Citrus modified pectin (MCP) in particular has been and is under extensive research17. Not all MCPs are the same because the term is used to describe water-soluble polysaccharides derived from pectin produced from citrus peel and pulp treated with high temperature high pH or enzymatic decomposition. pH-modified citrus pectin has reduced molecular weight and is derived from commercial citrus pectin and has galactose-rich side chains that are capable of binding to the prometastatic protein galactin-3 and inhibiting tumor cell metastasis. Galactin-3 plays a key role in several intracellular physiological and pathological processes including tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis. The binding of MCP to galactin-3 may inhibit the negative effects of galactin-3 such as inhibiting its ability to promote adhesion and migration of tumor cells and prevent apoptosis. In addition to galactose-rich side chains the homogalacturonan part of pectin also has anti-cancer activity. Low molecular weight pectin fragments (1 kDa) rich in galacturonic acid were absorbed by mouse and human cancer cells which inhibited the growth of these cells and led to the release of lactate dehydrogenase and galactin-3 from them. In addition to interacting with galactin-3 some other potential anticancer effects of modified pectins have been reported in both in vitro and in vivo conditions18. Low molecular weight citrus fractionated pectin powder (FPP) produced by autoclave hydrolysis or a combination of heating and enzymatic hydrolysis also induces androgen and androgen-independent prostate cancer cell apoptosis. MCPs produced by enzymatic degradation of pectasol induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells and increased the doubling time of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in patients undergoing various treatments used to treat prostate cancer. Enzymatically hydrolyzed citrus pectin has also been shown to have clinical benefits improved quality of life and reduced pain in patients with advanced tumors in various types of cancer19.

Pectins can be degraded to pectic oligosaccharides (POS) by various degradation methods such as enzymatic hydrolysis acid hydrolysis hydrothermal processing high-pressure microfluidization or photochemical reaction in TiO 2 -containing medium1020. Enzymatic methods have significant advantages over other methods such as: (1) the reaction is performed under mild operating conditions (2) the hydrolysis medium does not cause corrosion (3) no toxic or contaminating chemicals are used (4) hydrolysis is selective and affects only specific constituent units or bonds as expected for an enzyme-catalyzed reaction; (5) reaction efficiency may be higher than that achievable by chemical methods and (6) the formation of unwanted products is avoided21. Pectinolytic enzymes are classified into two main groups: (a) esterases including pectin methyl esterase and (b) depolymerase including hydrolase and lyase22. Many fungal species can break down pectin by producing different pectinolytic enzymes. Studies have shown that Alternaria sesami produces pectinolytic enzymes including polygalacturonase transeliminases pectin transeliminases and polygalacturonases23. Elrod reported for the first time that the Erwinia bacterium could degrade pectin23. Zucker et al.24 and Chatterjee et al.25 demonstrated the production of induced and extracellular endopolygalacturonase by Pseudomonas fluorescens and Erwinia.

Alcaligenes faecalis as a member of Alcaligenaceae from Betaproteobacteria class has many applications in biotechnology and food and health industries. Alcaligenes spp. has been used in the production of plastic-like storage material enzymes polysaccharides and also commercial production of amino acids as food additives26.

As a member of Paenibacillaceae from the Bacilli class Paenibacillus polymyxa is involved in a variety range of physiological and biotechnological processes. Different strains of this bacteria can be used in nitrogen fixation antibiotics production and phosphorus solubilization in the soil. P. polymyxa is known to produce cell wall degrading enzymes with hydrolytic pathways. Different strains of P. polymyxa were reported to produce exopolysaccharides (EPS) which as a secondary metabolite have a wide range of applications in bioindustries27.

In the current study A. faecalis AGS3 and P. polymyxa S4 were isolated and identified. The objective of this study was to investigate microbial degradation of pectin by pectinase of isolated bacterial isolates A. faecalis AGS3 and P. polymyxa S4 and for the first time identify products and then investigate the anticancer and antioxidative properties of obtained compounds.",,,,,,

Even though many pandemic precautions are fading the demand for clean healthy air in indoor spaces isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.

The average American spends roughly 90 percent of their time indoors further reiterating the need to keep indoor spaces clean healthy and safe for guests and occupants. However when cleaning and disinfecting to keep building guests and occupants safe from illness-causing germs such as coronavirus monkeypox influenza and other viruses janitorial staff can actually be contributing to an unhealthy environment.

Now readers may be thinking that cleaning removes dirt and other potentially hazardous soils while disinfecting eliminates germs from surfaces. How can cleaning and disinfecting cause harm?

The answer is volatile organic compounds or VOCs. VOCs add to air pollution and contribute to poor indoor air quality. In fact studies show that indoor concentrations of VOCs are often up to seven times higher than those outside.

Unfortunately VOCs are not only a potential problem when using certain cleaning and disinfecting products but can also be found in chemicals used for floor maintenance and other janitorial procedures. For example when a cleaning team is stripping a floor to bring back its glossy brilliance and restore the floor’s appearance for guests the process can actually be adding harmful pollutants (in the form of VOCs) to the air.

What Are VOCs?

VOCs are chemical compounds within a product that have a high vapor pressure and low water solubility. When used they form gases that are emitted into the air. VOCs typically are industrial solvents such as trichloroethylene; fuel oxygenates such as methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE); or by-products produced by chlorination in water treatment such as chloroform.

VOCs are commonly found in cleaning products in the form of solvents and fragrances.

Many common commercial cleaning products used to maintain facilities have VOCs. This includes: Floor care chemicals including floor stripper; cleaners and degreasers; glass cleaners; metal polishers; restroom and tile cleaners; and more.

Poor indoor air quality has a direct effect on human health. It has been linked to several adverse health effects including but not limited to headaches; fatigue; dizziness; irritation of eyes nose or throat; respiratory disease; heart disease; and cancer. The effects of poor indoor air quality can be exacerbated by age pre-existing medical conditions the amount of pollutants present and repeated exposure.

Depending on the type of facility managed this can create several issues.

Poor IAQ in schools can create long- and short-term health effects for students and staff which can impact their performance. In the short term students may have reduced attendance comfort and performance. Eventually this can inhibit growth and development in the classroom leading to long-term developmental gaps.

Businesses can experience worker callouts reduced staff productivity and increased illness among employees — all because of poor indoor air quality.

Poor air quality can also be detrimental to the well-being and experience of customers who visit a facility.

There is no number or rating that identifies “good” indoor air quality. To determine a facility’s IAQ air is sampled and individual measurements of common pollutants are tested. The air quality is calculated by measuring the amount of air pollutants in a facility against OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) guidelines.

OSHA’s exposure limits should be used in addition to limits set by Cal/OSHA the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH).

An area that does not exceed any of the recommended exposure limits during testing is considered to have a “good” IAQ.

Improving IAQ

While a major part of keeping occupants and other building guests healthy is protecting them from getting sick via respiratory and other illnesses cleaning professionals need to consider the implications of the cleaning and/or disinfecting floor care and other janitorial chemicals their maintenance teams source and use. There are two major tips facility managers should keep in mind when sourcing chemicals.

Tip #1: Verify Product Third-Party Certification

To improve the health and safety of an indoor space and protect the occupants and guests inside cleaning managers should seek out commercial cleaning chemicals that have been third-party certified to be “low-emitting” or “VOC-free.” These chemicals have been tested and verified by third-party agencies to meet standards for acceptable VOC contents.

That said VOC limit regulations can vary by product type chemical compound and even geographical location. There is a rage of third-party agencies that are currently testing and verifying a range of products for safety and sustainability. Seek guidance from a local distributor on what to look for on the products utilized.

Tip #2: Utilize Product Safety Data Sheets (SDS)

In addition to looking for third-party certifications cleaning executives should seek safety information on any given cleaning chemical from the product’s Safety Data Sheet which is more commonly known as the SDS.

The SDS lists all of the hazards along with the product’s chemical ingredients. Also listed in the SDS are the first aid measures exposure control/PPE (personal protective equipment) and toxicological information needed to properly evaluate the potential risks from using the product.

Per OSHA regulations the SDS for every chemical on premises needs to be accessible by front-line staff. The SDS is available from the distributor or the manufacturer.

All-in-all exposure to VOCs is unavoidable but minimizing guest and occupant exposure is principle to creating a safe healthy indoor environment.

This means the amount of PFAS being discharged – into the air or water or disposed of in the land – could be much higher than what we already know about. The problem shows the need for stronger Environmental Protection Agency regulation of industrial PFAS uses and a series of pending rules could help tackle this issue.

The loophole stems from EPA’s Toxics Release Inventory which requires manufacturers to track and report their report their manufacturing processing use or specific releases of of 180 different PFAS over 100 pounds per year. A release is a chemical emitted to the air or water or placed in a land disposal.

Several of these facilities producing large quantities of PFAS did not report releases during reporting years 2020 and 2021. Three Chemours facilities did not report discharges in 2020 but began doing so in 2021.

Those facilities – operated by Dow Chemical 3M Ortec Innovative Chemical Technologies and up to three unnamed companies – did report using large quantities of PFAS in their manufacturing processes to the EPA in 2020 through a different rule.

The Chemical Data Reporting rule or CDR requires manufacturers and importers to report data on production and use of certain PFAS in volumes of 2500 pounds or more per year. Although they produced or handled specific PFAS in large volumes these facilities did not file TRI reports for those PFAS.

According to the EPA these companies are avoiding their reporting responsibilities under the TRI by exploiting a loophole allowing them not to report if PFAS amounts are negligible defined as less than 1 percent of a total mixture.

EPA noticed lower-than-expected PFAS reporting in 2021 and contacted facilities that reported to the CDR but did not file TRI reports. All the facilities cited the loophole “as their reason for not submitting TRI reports for the PFAS.”

* Confidential business information or CBI (official designation)

The exemption exists for PFAS because of the Trump EPA.

Congress created the TRI reporting mandate for PFAS in the fiscal year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act setting a low threshold of 100 pounds. All chemicals with such low reporting thresholds are considered “chemicals of special concern"" and are codified in the same place in the Code of Federal Regulations or CFR – the collection of all federal rules.

Manufacturers cannot use the exemption to avoid reporting releases of chemicals of special concern. But when the Trump EPA finalized the rule they didn’t list PFAS as chemicals of special concern which have lower reporting thresholds. They are only included in the section of the CFR containing all TRI chemicals most of which have a typical reporting threshold of 10000 - 25000 pounds.

The exemption makes it possible for manufacturers to avoid TRI reporting by diluting or formulating their mixtures or trade name products so that the concentration of any single PFAS remains below 1 percent. Facilities can therefore avoid reporting even if they manufacture use or release one or a combination of PFAS in quantities significantly above the 100-pound threshold so long as each reportable forever chemical makes up less than 1 percent of the total mixture.PFAS are the only chemicals with a 100-pound reporting threshold subject to this reporting exemption. Congress clearly set this low reporting threshold for PFAS in the FY 2020 defense law and no other chemical with such a low reporting threshold can use this exemption – so the EPA’s implementation is clearly at odds with Congress’s intent.

Allowing manufacturers to skirt reporting requirements has serious public health consequences for communities that live near facilities that use PFAS and have a right to know how many forever chemicals companies are releasing into the environment.

Except for one facility the companies that reported to the CDR but not the TRI did not disclose their amounts of PFAS used or manufactured claiming it is confidential business information.

Yet each facility would have at least met the minimum threshold to report of 2500 pounds. The single site that did publicly report the amount in 2019 – Ortec Inc. in Easley S.C. – handled 9461 pounds of the single PFAS. Based on previous years use it is entirely possible that this site continued to handle this PFAS compound in 2020 any discharges of which went unreported to the TRI.

In the 2021 TRI EPA reports 45 facilities had discharges of 46 different PFAS chemicals. Those same facilities released about 143000 pounds of PFAS into the air and water potentially contaminating surrounding communities. Since at least seven large users of PFAS are likely not reporting the total discharges are likely much higher.

Problems with PFAS

PFAS are known as forever chemicals because once released into the environment they do not break down and can build up in our blood and organs. Exposure to PFAS increases the risk of cancer harms the development of the fetus and reduces the effectiveness of vaccines. Biomonitoring studies by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show the blood of nearly all Americans is contaminated with PFAS.

Hundreds of everyday products are made with toxic PFAS. Decades of use have resulted in the contamination of water soil and the blood of people and animals around the world.

This wouldn’t be the first time company’s like Dow and 3M were discovered to be less than forthcoming about the toxicity of their manufacturing processes. For decades manufacturers of PFAS chemicals knew the dangers of these chemicals but failed to inform regulators or the public. By the 1960s 3M and DuPont animal studies showed that PFAS were health hazards.

In the 1980s both companies linked PFAS to cancer and found elevated cancer rates among their own workers with one 3M scientist describing PFOS as “the most insidious pollutant since PCB.”

Providing greater transparency

A upcoming series of new rules could help right the problems and provide greater transparency about the full scope of industrial use of PFAS.

This fall the EPA plans to propose a new requirement to increase PFAS reporting to the TRI by removing the exemption for negligible amounts of PFAS.

And in January 2023 the agency is scheduled to publish a new rule that would require companies using PFAS to report all forever chemicals manufactured or imported since 2011.

In August California passed a bill that if signed into law would set reporting requirements for companies in the state that manufacture or import products containing PFAS chemicals.

These regulations would give us a better picture of where PFAS are being discharged around the U.S.

And the EPA recently proposed designating the two most notorious types of PFAS – PFOA and PFOS – as hazardous substances. The designation means the agency must be notified immediately if a facility discharges a pound or more within 24 hours. This will give the EPA more information about releases as they happen and may help the agency identify other facilities that are underreporting their discharges.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvcmxkLWdyYWluLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8xNzUwNy1hZ2ktZWxldmF0ZXMtaG91c2Vob2xkZXItdG8tY2Vv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AGI elevates Householder to CEO,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvcmxkLWdyYWluLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8xNzUwNy1hZ2ktZWxldmF0ZXMtaG91c2Vob2xkZXItdG8tY2Vv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000026740D56980>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Credit: Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment

The U.S. Senate voted to ratify an international treaty on Sept. 21 2022 and join 137 other countries in agreeing to phase out a class of climate-warming chemicals that are widely used as coolants in refrigerators air conditioners and heat pumps.

If you're getting a sense of déjà vu don't be surprised.

These chemicals called hydrofluorocarbons or HFCs were commercialized in the 1990s as a replacement for earlier refrigerants that were based on chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs. CFCs were destroying the ozone layer high in the Earth's atmosphere which is essential for protecting life from the Sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation.

HFCs are less harmful than CFCs but they create another problem—they have a strong heat-trapping effect that is contributing to global warming.

If HFCs can be phased down globally—as many countries have agreed to do under the 2016 Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol the treaty just ratified by the U.S. Senate on a bipartisan vote—that would avoid about half a degree Celsius of temperature rise compared to preindustrial times. China a major producer of these chemicals ratified the amendment effective Sept. 15 2021. And the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency finalized a rule in 2021 to cut HFCs production and imports.

Let's take a closer look at what HFCs are and what might replace them next.

How HFCs keep rooms and food cool

Refrigerators and air conditioning use a technology known as a heat pump. It sounds almost miraculous—heat pumps use energy to take heat out of a cold place and dump it in a warm place.

Here's how a refrigerator works: A fluid—CFCs back in the old days and now HFCs—circulates in the walls of the refrigerator absorbing the ambient heat to keep the fridge cooled down. As that liquid absorbs the heat it evaporates. The resulting vapor is pumped to the coils on the back of the refrigerator where it is condensed back to a liquid under pressure. In the process the heat that was absorbed from inside the fridge is released into the surrounding room.

Air conditioners and home heat pumps do the same thing: they use electric-powered compressors and evaporators to move heat into or out of a house.

Choosing the right fluid for a refrigerator means finding a substance that can be evaporated and condensed at the right temperatures by changing the pressure on the fluid.

CFCs seemed to fit the bill perfectly. They didn't react with the tubing or compressors to corrode the equipment and they weren't toxic or flammable.

Unfortunately the chemical stability of CFCs turned out to be a problem that threatened the whole world as scientists discovered in the 1980s. Leaking CFCs mostly from discarded equipment remain in the atmosphere for a long time. Eventually they make their way to the stratosphere where they are finally destroyed by UV radiation from the sun. But when they break down they create chlorine that reacts with the protective ozone letting dangerous radiation through to the Earth's surface.

When production of CFCs was eliminated in the 1990s to protect the ozone layer new refrigerants were developed and the industry shifted to HFCs. How a refrigerator works.

Why HFCs are a climate problem

HFCs are like CFCs but much more reactive in air so they never reach the stratosphere where they could harm Earth's protective radiation shield. They largely saved the world from impending ozone disaster and they are now found in refrigerators and heat pumps everywhere.

But while HFCs' chemical reactivity prevents them from depleting the ozone layer their molecular structure allows them to absorb a lot of thermal radiation making them a greenhouse gas. Like carbon dioxide on steroids HFCs are extremely good at capturing infrared photons emitted by the Earth. Some of this radiant energy warms the climate.

Unlike carbon dixoide reactive HFCs are consumed by chemistry in the air so they only warm the climate for a decade or two. But a little bit goes a long way—each HFC molecule absorbs thousands of times as much heat as a carbon dixoide molecule making them powerful climate pollutants.

HFCs leaking from discarded cooling equipment are estimated to contribute about 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions—about twice as much as aviation.

This is why it's time to retire HFCs and swap them out for alternative refrigerants. They've done their job saving the ozone layer but now HFCs are a major contributor to short-term global warming and their use has been increasing as demand for cooling increases around the world.

What can replace HFCs?

Because they are so powerful and short-lived stopping the production and use of HFCs can have a significant cooling effect on the climate over the next couple of decades buying time as the world converts its energy supply from fossil fuels to cleaner sources.

The good news is that there are alternative refrigerants.

Ammonia and hydrocarbons like butane evaporate at room temperature and have been used as refrigerants since the early 20th century. These gases are short-lived but they have a downside. Their greater reactivity means their compressors and plumbing have to be more corrosion-resistant and leak-proof to be safe.

The chemical industry has been developing newer alternatives intended to be safer for both people and climate but as we saw with CFCs and HFCs inert chemicals can have unintended consequence. Several industry leaders have supported efforts to phase out HFCs.

So it's time for another generation of cooling equipment. Just as TVs and audio equipment and light bulbs have evolved over past decades refrigerators and air conditioners will be replaced by a new wave of improved products. New refrigerators will look and work just like the ones we're used to but they will be much gentler on the climate system.

ABNB,Airbnb,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8yMi9idXNpbmVzcy9uaWdodGNhcC1haXJibmItZmVlcy9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFAaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8wOS8yMi9idXNpbmVzcy9uaWdodGNhcC1haXJibmItZmVlcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Enjoy your Airbnb — just don't forget to do the laundry and take out the trash,"New York CNN Business —

Anyone who’s stayed in an Airbnb knows the experience can be a roll of the dice. Anything can happen when you roll up to your rental. That’s part of the charm — you might be pleasantly surprised by a free bottle of wine waiting for you in the kitchen or you might have an adventure just trying to unlock the door with the weird skeleton key that you had to dig out from behind a tree in the backyard.

But renters are getting increasingly fed up with lists of do’s and don’ts that await them inside. Strip the beds wash the linens load and unload the dishwasher water the plants mow the lawn don’t touch the record collection…

And that’s on top of triple-digit cleaning fees.

The backlash against persnickety hosts is growing according to reporting from the Wall Street Journal. One traveler told the Journal that her $299-a-night Airbnb in Sedona Arizona came with a $375 cleaning fee plus a list of chores.

Which is pretty much the last thing anyone wants to do on vacation.

Airbnb hosts say there are two reasons for the higher fees and the chore demands: Covid-19 raised sanitation requirements and — you guessed it — inflation. The cost of hiring cleaners is up as are utility bills. And hosts aren’t renting out their properties just for fun — they’re running a business.

Airbnb allows hosts to set their own rates and encourages them to avoid cleaning fees if possible. The company says a little over half of its active listings charge such fees which on average make up less than 10% of the total reservation cost.

For some travelers those added costs and labor have served as a reminder that once upon a time before the gig economy there were these other places you could rent in buildings across the country where the cleaning is done for you. Ah yes hotels! Remember them?

One frustrated traveler told the Journal that the lakefront cottage she rented didn’t have a working dishwasher or vacuum so she spent the last day wiping the floor by hand. Then the host gave her a lowly three-star review for cleanliness.

Her next trip will be in a hotel.

“It’s 50 bucks cheaper” she told the paper. “And we don’t have to clean anything.”

To be sure some travelers with bad Airbnb experiences are fleeing to hotels but there doesn’t appear to be an existential threat to the homestay model Airbnb pioneered.

It’s a bit like choosing between Starbucks or the local indie coffee shop when you’re in a new city. At Starbucks you know what you’re getting. Will it be the best cup of coffee of your life? Probably not but at least you can count on it. The local spot probably has unexpected charms quirky art on the walls maybe even superior coffee but it could also smell weird or play pan flute music or just take too long to make your order.

Hotels cater to the Starbucks crowd; Airbnb is counting on the indie café set who tend want to feel as if they live wherever they’re visiting.

BOTTOM LINE

The social media outrage about cleaning fees and chores is certainly a PR headache for Airbnb but it’s far from a crisis. The Airbnb model is now fully woven into the fabric of the hospitality industry even if it still has some growing pains to work out.

Pent-up demand this year has helped the company swing to a profit in the second quarter even as inflation ate into travelers’ budgets.

Airbnb is also leaning into the work-from-anywhere model — its own CEO Brian Chesky announced earlier this year that he’d be living full-time as a digital nomad bouncing around from one Airbnb to another every few weeks. That’s something hotels can’t sell in the same way (according to me someone who spent three full weeks in a 100-square-foot hotel room earlier this year and nearly lost her mind in the process).

HOUSING MESS

Trying to buy a home anytime in the past two years has been… tricky to say the least. In late 2020 the problem was supply — buyers were flush and mortgage rates were low there just weren’t enough houses on the market (cue the all-cash bidding wars).

Now though the problem is demand. Buyers are dropping out of the market because listing prices remain high and mortgage rates which have already doubled over the past year are poised to keep climbing as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.

Consider this mind-blowing calculation from my colleague Anna Bahney:

A year ago a buyer who put 20% down on a median-priced home ($359900 at the time) and financed the rest with a mortgage rate of 2.86% (the average 30-year fixed rate at the time) had a monthly payment of $1192.

Today that same buyer would find the median price has shot up to $403800 and the average mortgage rate is more than 6% so their monthly payment would come out to $1941. That’s $749 more every month!

That’s just one of the myriad ways the Fed’s rate moves affect real people.

BOTTOM LINE

The housing mess is worse than a one-two punch. It’s really a one-two-three-four punch when you consider (1) still-elevated prices for homes (2) still-low inventory thanks to supply chain problems (3) the rental market also sucks because so many would-be homebuyers are flooding in driving up prices for people who have no choice but to rent and (4) the cost of literally everything else in your life is up at the same time. Honestly there’s probably a fifth sixth and seventh punch in there too but we don’t have time for all that.

So will it get better? Eventually. Prices are starting to come down (yay!) but mortgage rates may keep going up as long as the Fed keeps raising interest rates. That likely won’t happen until 2024 at the earliest (boo!).

The big idea

Female Airbnb hosts in the United States earn on average about 25% less per year than their male counterparts for their rentals according to our new study. That’s slightly higher than the annual gender wage gap reported by the U.S. Census Bureau and adds up to more than US$4000 in lower earnings per year.

Our analysis revealed that the average nightly rate of a female host’s listing was $30 cheaper than those of male hosts.

You can listen to more articles from The Conversation narrated by Noa here.

For this research we analyzed data taken from the public profiles of 8000 hosts across several U.S. cities. We focused on listings with only one host and just one active listing. The name each host posted on their public profile was coded as female or male and gender-ambiguous names were excluded.

To determine a host’s annual earnings we analyzed each listing’s nightly price number of stays per year and the average length of stay. We also looked at other factors that might contribute to the earnings gap such as the number of guests that could be accommodated and the number of years each host had been active on the platform.

We also determined the difference in property values between genders by extracting data from Zillow.com about the median home value in the ZIP code where each listing was located.

Our analysis revealed that the average nightly rate of female hosts’ listings was $30 cheaper than those of male hosts. Further female hosts booked fewer reservations and each stay typically accommodated fewer guests.

We found that women make up just over half – 53% – of hosts and have slightly more valuable properties than male hosts. We did not find any significant difference between the number of years female and male hosts have been active on the platform.

The earnings difference appears to be most prevalent when a host is renting out an entire home as opposed to offering a private room within their own residence. And while the gap narrows after controlling for many listing-related factors – such as median home value – a difference in earnings persists.

This suggests that we need to look beyond the Airbnb data to explain the gap.

Why it matters

Our research shines a light on the need to delve further into what factors may be contributing to differences in earnings between genders.

In the U.S. female full-time workers still earn about 80 cents for every dollar earned by their male counterparts and more women than men live in poverty. This income shortfall also affects millions of children because according to the Census Bureau around 1 in 4 families headed by a woman are poor compared to just over 1 in 10 headed by a man.

Among the known reasons for this pay gap: Women are more likely than men to select jobs that require shorter hours or provide flexibility in scheduling. Shorter hours and flexibility in scheduling are preferable for workers who have more demanding obligations at home. However these jobs are often lower paying.

However Airbnb hosts have full control of their scheduling and booking of their listings and female hosts set their own rates. So lack of scheduling flexibility should not be a major factor in explaining why women earn less than men on the platform.

What still isn’t known

The most important unknown in this area of research is whether women are aware that they are offering lower prices than men.

Exploring whether there are gender-based earnings differences on other hospitality platforms as well like Vrbo or Homestay could provide new insights.

Also it’s not yet clear whether or why male and female hosts take different approaches to setting Airbnb rates – although other research suggests some clues. A 2007 study found that compared to women men negotiate for higher payments in bargaining situations. And a 2009 study of gender differences in setting professional fees found that women typically charge less than men for the same services because they tend to be more relationship-oriented toward their clients which can lead them to charge lower prices.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5haXJibmIuY29tL2VuLXVrL2FpcmJuYi1yZXZlYWxzLW1vc3Qtd2lzaGxpc3RlZC1kZXNpZ24taG9tZXMtaW4tdGhlLXVrJUVGJUJGJUJDL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airbnb Reveals Most Wishlisted Design Homes in the UK,"As London Design Festival 2022 draws to a close Airbnb’s new Design Category features approximately 20000 (1) listings globally and counting – so lovers of architecture and interior design can easily discover their next design-led stay on Airbnb.

Guest columnist

Andy Kelleher has been the executive director of Main Street Lansing for four years.

Lansing is a small community of 968 people along the banks of the Mississippi River in northeast Iowa. It is a popular tourist town and the population nearly triples during the summer months. These visitors need a place to sleep which has led to a dramatic increase in short-term rentals like Airbnbs in the Lansing community.

Unfortunately Iowa law has allowed these short-term rentals to expand unchecked which has harmed Lansing's housing market.

On June 29 2020 House File 2641 was signed into law by Gov. Kim Reynolds. That law amended Iowa Code Section 414.1 and placed many restrictions on a city's control over short-term rental properties including ""A city shall not adopt or enforce any regulation restriction or other ordinance including a conditional use permit requirement relating to short-term rental properties within the city"" and ""A city shall not require a license or permit fee for a short term-rental property in the city."" Iowa Code Section 414.1 does offer an extremely limited list of situations that would allow you to restrict short-term rentals but protecting residential housing is not a valid situation.

This law has created an undue burden on our available housing stock. Before the age of Airbnb one-third of Lansing homes sat vacant for most of the year functioning as summer homes for more affluent citizens who reside elsewhere. Now that sites like Airbnb have proven themselves to be a lucrative option for property ownership we are finding that many of our available houses are selling to developers who turn the building into a short-term rental robbing our citizens of the opportunity for a home. Developers have realized that they can generate much more revenue through short-term rentals than through long-term residents.

Further complicating matters is the geography of Lansing itself; with the Mississippi River on one side and two large bluffs boxing in the city's north and south sides the community does not have much room to develop or build new housing. If we are to plan for the future we must work with the current housing stock to develop sustainable housing availability.

Local municipalities need more control over their short-term rental market in their jurisdictions. If we allow short-term rentals to crowd out our residents and businesses we'll destroy the community that brings visitors here in the first place.

To be clear I am not opposed to short-term rentals. We obviously need places for visitors to stay; additionally my economic development organization is partially funded through hotel/motel tax revenue. However much like every tourist community in the nation Lansing needs to balance the needs of residents with the needs of its transient population.

GRAHAM COOLEY

CEO ITM Power Graham Cooley is a hydrogen veteran and CEO of ITM Power a major electrolyzer manufacturer based in the UK. ITM Power is the first hydrogen related company to be listed on London Stock Market and has been developing electrolyzer equipment for more than 20 years. Before assuming charge as the CEO in 2009 Cooley was Business Development Manager in National Power plc where he spent 11 years in the power industry developing energy storage and generation technologies. Prior to joining ITM Power Graham was CEO of Sensortec Ltd founding CEO of Metalysis Ltd a spin out of Cambridge University and founding CEO of Antenova Ltd. ITM Power manufactures integrated hydrogen energy solutions that meet the requirements for grid balancing and energy storage services and to produce clean fuel for transport renewable heat and chemicals. The company uses the Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) technology that uses only electricity (renewable) and tap water to generate hydrogen gas on-site. Cooley claims that the 1000 MW-a-year electrolyzer factory that ITM Power is currently building will bring down the cost of equipment through economies of scale. The company is also involved in the research and development of scientific and engineering projects; development and manufacture of prototype products; and sale of electrolysis equipment and hydrogen storage solutions. It also operates 13 hydrogen refuelling stations. Cooley believes electrolyzers are needed to decarbonize the power sector as they will allow more wind and solar power to be added to the grid from projects that might otherwise be unprofitable. And if the excess renewable energy could be sold to green-hydrogen producers it would increase the income for wind and solar project owners. This otherwise 'curtailed' energy when used to fuel electrolyzers produces hydrogen at zero cost.

The energy industry is the largest industry on the planet. And hydrogen is only beginning to scratch the surface. We haven't even started. Graham Cooley

WANG CHUAN-FU Chairman and CEO BYD Co. Ltd. Wang Chuan-fu is Chairman CEO and founder of BYD ('Build Your Dreams') a Shenzhen-headquartered electric vehicle manufacturer. Wang founded BYD in 1995 at a young age of 29 as a rechargeable lithium-ion battery manufacturing company for mobile phones before foraying into EV manufacturing in 2003. The genesis of the EV giant can be traced almost two decades back when Wang unveiled the plan of buying a failing State car manufacturer (Tsinchuan Automobile Company) and forayed into manufacturing electric cars. By 2008 BYD was selling the world's first production plug-in-hybrid. With a decade of experience in battery business and newfound capability to manufacture automobiles BYD soon became one of the world's first fully vertically integrated EV makers in the world. Today BYD's vertical integration – controlling the supply chain from the minerals to the computer chips used in EVs - is regarded as world-class by industry veterans and analysts alike. It is this supply chain dominance that lends BYD a competitive advantage against other EV makers in the market. In the first half of 2022 BYD surpassed Tesla as the world's top seller of electric cars recording over 641000 vehicle sales. Currently about half the cars sold by BYD are plug-in-hybrids which China counts as 'new energy vehicles' along with the pure battery and hydrogen-powered models. BYD continues to reign as the second largest EV battery manufacturer in China (after CATL) and low-cost manufacturer of EV cars and batteries. It has over the years diversified beyond batteries and cars into commercial vehicles which cover ten market segments: buses coaches and e-taxis; logistics construction and sanitation vehicles; vehicles for warehousing port airport and mining operations. It also has a presence in solar energy and monorail systems. Wang graduated with a bachelor's degree in metallurgical physical chemistry from Central South Industrial University in 1987. He received a master's degree in materials in 1990 from the Beijing General Research Institute of Non-Ferrous Metals where he worked as a deputy director before founding BYD using $400000 borrowed money from his cousin and with 20 employees.

JoseCarlos Garcia Principal Scientist

JoseCarlos Garcia is a Principal Scientist and 12-year P&G Veteran. He has spent 11 + years at P&G working with the Microbiome Innovation team developing things like Align technology Microban24 products and sustainable end of product lifecycle solutions for Baby Care. The Microbiome team deals mostly with hygiene which Jose says at its core is just about “improving and maintaining health and wellness for humans and the environment.” “It’s more than just cleaning” he says. “It’s finding the right balance between preventing disease and maintaining health and resilience at both the micro and the macro levels that drives most of the work I do in the hygiene space.” JoseCarlos’s innovative mindset comes from how he grew up. “My upbringing in a resource-strapped environment taught me to do a lot with very little and to be mindful of passing that value along to consumers.” This led to his passion for innovation and technology which only grew in his academic career where he learned how to best assess problems and solve them. JoseCarlos says that most of his satisfaction comes from the personal letters he’s received from consumers. “It’s a constant reminder of the responsibility I have in improving their lives.” Even at home JoseCarlos is always looking for ways to improve the world. He’ll see a product at a store and think to himself “’how can I make it better?’ or ‘how can I obsolete it?’ I choose to believe” he says. “I’m going to help create and leave a better world for my kids and for future generations.” Jhohan Lozano Senior Scientist Feminine Care R&D

Senior Scientist Jhohan Lozano says his greatest accomplishment at P&G is simply working for the company. “My family and I came to the US as immigrants from Colombia in 1999. My parents made the hard decision of uprooting their life for the hope that my sisters and I could have a better future here in the States. The opportunity alone to work for a major company like P&G along with the amount of ownership & tangible experiences I’m provided is the greatest accomplishment.” In the five years he has been at P&G Jhohan has worked in material development & product research landing within the Feminine Care R&D team helping to develop Always FlexFoam and distribute that technology among other brands like Radiantand Pure Cotton. Jhohan credits his passion for innovation to his childhood. “I see the connection from my younger self loving to play with Legos and tinkering with anything in the house into a Senior Scientist working to provide real solutions that will impact the lives of countless women” he said. “My work allows me the opportunity to continue those passions and innovate alongside teams that are experts across so many areas.” When he’s not launching new products you can find Jhohan in the kitchen “My phone ALWAYS eats first!” he says. He is also proudly rooted in his Hispanic heritage working to lead the Hispanic Young Professional’s group for the company recruit key Hispanic STEM talent and enable Hispanic summer interns by co-leading the company’s development program.

BALTIMORE — Morgan State University’s Team ZillowBears earned top honors amid a competitive field of more than 200 students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) showcasing their ingenuity and savvy in Zillow’s second annual HBCU Housing Hackathon. The realty-based case competition awarded top prizes to teams that developed innovations to help renters and first-time buyers find their dream homes.

The first place ZillowBears a team of four Morgan students majoring in Computer Science won $20000 for its “Z-Save” application which estimates monthly mortgage costs and lets users deposit that amount into a virtual wallet that tracks their payment trends. The app also shows lenders data points to help determine whether potential homeowners qualify for a mortgage and offers them a way to prove creditworthiness outside the traditional credit scoring system. As part of the first-place prize Zillow® also will donate $25000 to Morgan’s Department of Computer Science.

The top three finishers in the hackathon in collaboration with the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) and Amplify 4 Good won over the judges with projects that offer impactful tech solutions that align with Zillow's mission to help consumers overcome obstacles in their journey to find a home.

“I wanted to participate in the hackathon to learn more about the real estate industry and explore on a deeper level how technology can help solve the most prominent issues people face every day when trying to secure a home” said Nanfwang Dawurang a member of ZillowBears and a senior computer science student at Morgan State University. “Seeing how different people look at the same issue in completely different ways and the various innovative and exciting ideas presented in tackling housing issues showed me that progress can always be made when people come together and are intentional about solving a problem.”

Joining Dawurang on the first-place team were Oluwadara Dina (junior) Saad Nadeem (senior) and Godsheritage Adeoye (freshman). Their winning Z-Save application was designed to address disproportionate mortgage denial rates for Black and Latinx borrowers due to low credit scores by providing an alternative way for lenders to assess financial credibility. Users can build a positive payment history and receive a “Z-score” which can be used as an indicator of creditworthiness.

The HBCU Hackathon brought together 65 teams six of which advanced to the final round. Each finalist was given five minutes to present their ideas virtually using live demonstrations and presentation decks to a panel of judges made up of Zillow and tech industry leaders.

“We are very impressed with the caliber of the work the quality of the presentations and the outstanding innovative ideas the students displayed at Zillow's second HBCU Housing Hackathon” said Aldona Clottey Zillow vice president of Corporate Social Responsibility and one of the judges. “With 20 schools represented this hackathon not only helps Zillow continue to foster engagement among HBCUs but it allows us to tap our next generation of technology leaders to help ensure we are continuously evolving as a company and positively impacting the technology industry as a whole.”

Judges of the semifinal round included Lakshmi Dixit Zillow vice president of Tech Engineering and Operations; Kevin Regensberg Zillow senior technical product manager; Damien Peters founder Wealth Noir; Richard Clay investment partner Door Room Fund; and Chad Womack Ph.D. vice president of National STEM Programs and Tech Initiatives at UNCF.

The hackathon’s final pitch round was judged by Zillow and tech industry leaders that included Eric Bailey vice president of Experience Design at Zillow; Aldona Clottey vice president of Corporate Social Responsibility at Zillow; April Daley software engineer at Etsy; Jonathan Rabb founder and CEO of Watch The Yard; and Chad Womack Ph.D. vice president of National STEM Programs and Tech Initiatives at UNCF.

All students from the top three teams also will receive new laptops and textbook gift cards and all eligible hackathon participants interested in a role at Zillow will have an opportunity to interview for an internship

In addition to the winning team Morgan was well-represented in the late rounds of the competition. A second team from Baltimore’s anchor institution the Broker Bears consisting of Morgan students Efosa Isujeh Subomi Popoola Martin Adu-Boahene and Dimitri Watat were semifinalists in the Zillow HBCU Housing Hackathon.

However the stadium itself is full of history.

1861-1865 | Camp Randall before it was Camp Randall but still Camp Randall.

The stadium got its name from the ground it stands on. When the civil war began the State Agricultural Society donated the area they used for the Wisconsin State Fair to wartime efforts. Governor Alexander Randall used these grounds as a training camp for Union soldiers.

1865-1917 | Becoming a University Landmark

Post-war the Big Ten’s oldest functioning stadium was bought for $25000 in 1893 and subsequently granted to the University in the early 1910s. A field fit for 3000 spectators was put in place for football and track + field events.

With only wooden bleachers in place the seating options could not handle the crowd’s energy – the bleachers collapsed during a visit from they who shall not be named (the Minnesota Gophers) in 1915. This event rushed the funding + construction of a concrete stadium which is still in place today + sturdy enough to withstand even the rowdiest of “Jump Arounds”.

By 1917 just two years after the collapse the Gophers were back and the Badgers were ready. The revamped stadium was christened with a Badger victory over the same team who witnessed the collapse. This full-circle moment fueled the long-lasting rivalry between the teams.

1917-2022 | The rest is history

After not one not two but three expansions between 1957-1965 plus more seats added as recently as last year the stadium has reached a capacity of 80000 people. Quite the increase from the original stadium’s 3000.

In more recent years we’ve seen the stadium undergo renovations to upgrade facilities and create a more modern environment for fans with things like new seats + heated floors.

While we love basking in the new amenities our appreciation for this Madison landmark is rooted in its rich history.

During his 45-year farming career the Fond du Lac County native has seen a lot of change on the farm where he grew up and still lives.

The 66-year-old returned to the home farm in 1976 after graduating from the University of Wisconsin-Madison Farm and Industry Short Course. A year later he married his wife Karen. In 1977 they milked 50 registered Holstein cows and farmed 300 acres with his parents Paul and Delores Ruedinger.

During the past 45 years their farm has undergone several expansions. Today John and Karen own and operate a 1500-cow dairy and farm 1500 acres with their daughter Jamie her husband David Zappa and 18 farm employees. Their cows are milked three times a day and average 95 pounds of milk per cow per day.

Overcoming challenges

While their modern dairy farm is highly successful today John is quick to point out that he and Karen have overcome several challenges on the farm during the past four-and-a-half decades.

Their biggest challenge came in March 1996 when their flat-barn parlor and small converted freestall barn caught on fire and burned to the ground killing 100 cows and heifers.

“I was 40 years old and in the prime of my farming career” John recalls. “My dad was 66 and getting ready to retire. We were farming 500 acres at the time. We didn’t know what to do — rebuild or take the $300000 insurance check and find something else to do.”

John and Karen did a lot of soul-searching.

“I couldn’t see myself doing anything else so Karen and I decided to start the expansion process” John says. “We knew we needed to move from being the sole laborers to managing people and systems. The next 10 years were very challenging trying to navigate the process.”

They slowly worked through the transition and took over the responsibilities of growth and management of the family business.

“There were many times when I thought ‘Why did I do this?’ The growth phases were very taxing physically and mentally” John explains.

As the Ruedingers’ farm grew so did John’s involvement in farm organizations and on co-op boards.

“I have always said that my college education came when I became involved in the agriculture industry” John says. “During my time on the Professional Dairy Producers [PDPW] board — 2001 to 2006 — I came to know the key agriculture stakeholders in Wisconsin. I learned from both private and corporate businesses and through these experiences diversified my thinking and expanded my industry knowledge.”

Since 1989 John has served on the Genex-Cooperative Resources Inter-national board of directors. The formation of CRI brought together two cooperatives 21st Century Genetics (later named Genex) and AgSource.

“This helped me transition into a businessperson. Seeing how CEOs and CFOs operate and the decisions they make to move a business forward is an incredible experience” he says. “I believe that big-picture thinking of PDPW and the cooperative system allowed me to grow and expand our family dairy business. I accomplished the expansion process of our dairy business while serving with these two organizations.”

More recently John provided leadership for the formation of Urus which in the world of cattle genetics and herd management information is the first business of its kind combining both cooperative and private ownership.

John has traveled extensively on behalf of Genex to numerous countries in South America and Europe speaking to groups of farmers and agribusiness people. He is also a member of the Fond du Lac County Forage Council Midwest Forage Council board National Forage Association board and Fond du Lac County Farm Bureau.

In 2009 John became a Wisconsin Master Agriculturist.

Upcoming plans

John says Ruedinger Farms will see more changes in the next five years. They are planning to milk 500 more cows and add a manure digester.

“We are in the final stages of the business transition with our daughter Jamie and her husband David. We have been working on that process for six years now” he says. “It takes time to develop a transition plan and make all those involved comfortable with the decisions.”

John and Karen have four children: a son John and daughters Melissa Laura and Jamie. They also have seven grandchildren ages 6 to 20 years. Their son John and his wife Natalie live in Germantown Wis. with their two children Anna and Joseph. Melissa and husband Ryan and their children Adison Aiden and Ashton live in Sturgeon Bay Wis. Laura lives in Portland Ore. Jamie and David and their children Zachary and Ava live in North Fond du Lac Wis.

John says he is truly honored to be selected as the 2022 World Dairy Expo Dairy Producer of the Year.

“It is an honor of a lifetime of achievements as a dairy producer and an industry partner” John says. “This award represents all producers around the world who work hard every day providing nutritious products to feed the world. I am honored humbled and proud.”

World Dairy Expo is Oct. 2-7 at the Alliant Energy Center in Madison Wis. John will be honored Oct. 5 during the World Dairy Expo Recognition Awards Banquet at 7 p.m. in The Tanbark.
