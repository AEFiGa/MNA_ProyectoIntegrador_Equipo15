While businesses should be doing their best to give back to society the mere existence of these highly visible external actions does not always tell us about who the company is at its core. Sure maybe they are making bold moves to combat climate change but they could also suffer from an exceedingly toxic internal culture which may in turn affect the lives of employees and their families.

Decency is something more fundamental. Decency reveals itself both in outwardly visible actions as well as in ways that are much more subtle; it is about always trying to do the right thing by one another even when no one is looking. As we emerge from the turmoil of the pandemic decency will be a key differentiator for businesses.

A lot has been said about the “Great Resignation” but from what I have seen in Asia Pacific I think of it more as a “Great Re-evaluation”—a moment in time where people are questioning just how they want to spend their working lives. More people are trying their hands at becoming entrepreneurs or they are looking for more fluid working arrangements or a role that will be more fulfilling. In this kind of labor market a corporate culture of decency can be the tipping point that brings in a new hire or retains an existing employee.

However given the somewhat intangible nature of decency fostering it in a corporate setting requires a nuanced approach and an appreciation of the fact that there’s no “one-size-fits-all” way to do it.

Encourage decency at the top but do not make it “top-down”

It is all well and good to say that we should value decency but it is not something that can be mandated by edict. It needs to start with a company’s leaders setting the tone and then ensuring that this outlook is reflected at all levels of the company whether it is in hiring practices people management or conflict resolution. When employees feel that they are being treated with respect and decency they are also more likely to act accordingly. Ultimately decency begets decency.

While these values may need an instigator they should not be forced. Genuine cultural change can be slow and requires dialogue leading by example and acknowledging complexities. But once it permeates an organization it is much more likely to self-perpetuate and stay in place.

Reward cooperation not competition

Perhaps one of the biggest impediments to a culture of decency is internal competition between employees. It is a natural human trait that can be compounded by promotion processes that rely heavily on KPIs. The behaviors that foster good relations between employees such as cooperativeness compassion and supportiveness are more difficult to quantify but if you care about a workplace where decency is valued these qualities need to be recognized and rewarded.

This is not to say that these are the only qualities that we should focus on when we are looking to promote someone but we also need to recognize that personal ambition and the ability to cooperate are not mutually exclusive.

Speaking from my own experience at Mastercard we find that employees at all levels of the company do best when helping each other be great. In fact they can recognize others for it through an in-house platform where employees are able to write notes of appreciation for their colleagues’ acts of support and kindness—a demonstration of our Decency Quotation as we call it in action.

This culture of collaboration and collective growth allows us to be externally—rather than internally—competitive. An employee culture of “sharp elbows” tends to result in a battered and bruised workforce rather than one that feels supported and unified in its goals.

Make decency a foundation—not just an add-on

In a time of upheaval growing internal and external expectations and changing cultural norms many corporate entities are rushing to demonstrate their awareness and elevate how they practice inclusion and care. While commendable doing right by employees (and communities at large) should be a consistent guiding principle rather than a sudden response to the changing tides of culture and other social forces.

An enduring ethos of decency regardless of what’s happening in the world more broadly promotes a sense of trust and safety internally and lends greater credence to companies’ efforts to tackle big societal issues. At its most fundamental level a foundation of decency also means that complex issues can be discussed openly with empathy in an environment where everyone can have their voices heard.

Decency should not require inducements

As a company focused on building a sustainable economy where everyone can prosper at Mastercard we have found that a greater sense of empathy among our employees allows us to have a more open-minded human-centric approach when designing our solutions. In a safe workplace where employees’ contributions are respected they are also more likely to embrace new ideas and innovate in ways that drive true business impact.

We all want to be treated decently. To say that this very central trait does not need to be encouraged in our offices and in our boardrooms is to say that decency is not important in the places where we spend a great deal of our time and effort. Quiet modest decency has been overlooked for too long in the business world but if we want to create enduring happy teams that must change. Do not be decent because it is good for the company—be decent because it is good for us all as humans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBnYXRvdXIuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbmV3cy9sYXRlc3QvMjAyMi8wOC8xMC9rYW1haXUtam9obnNvbi1jYXB0dXJlcy0yMDIyLW1hc3RlcmNhcmQtYXBnYS10b3VyLWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kamaiu Johnson captures 2022 Mastercard APGA Tour Championship,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', ConnectionResetError(10054, 'An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host', None, 10054, None)) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBnYXRvdXIuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbmV3cy9sYXRlc3QvMjAyMi8wOC8xMC9rYW1haXUtam9obnNvbi1jYXB0dXJlcy0yMDIyLW1hc3RlcmNhcmQtYXBnYS10b3VyLWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyZW5kaHVudGVyLmNvbS90cmVuZHMvcmVpLWNvb3AtbWFzdGVyY2FyZNIBOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyZW5kaHVudGVyLmNvbS9hbXAvdHJlbmRzL3JlaS1jb29wLW1hc3RlcmNhcmQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eco-Friendly Credit Cards,"REI Partners with Capital One to Launch the 'REI Co-op Mastercard'

She was 69.

She was born on August 11 1952 in Medford to Yolanda Troisi and John Arthur Buttimer. She spent her childhood in Winchester and attended Sacred Heart Academy in Newton. She matriculated to Marymount College where she excelled in history and political science. She continued her education at New York University where she received masters degrees in finance and political science.

She spent almost her entire professional life in marketing financial services working for American Express Citibank and ultimately Mastercard International where she was a senior vice president. She loved her work and particularly treasured her many years at Mastercard working with a team that became her second family. She travelled extensively for the company and enjoyed familiarizing herself with different business cultures and local restaurants.

She was a devoted mother to daughters Kirsten and Caroline and wife to her husband Thomas. She spent countless hours at soccer games cherished shopping excursions with her daughters and worshiped NFL Sundays with her family cheering for Tom Brady. Family vacations to Martha’s Vineyard St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Positano brought her special joy. She was committed to providing her daughters with the best education possible and always emphasized the importance of loyalty and persistence. She made friends everywhere she went and maintained those friendships until her death.

She was an elegant woman and always fashionably attired. Yet under this chic veneer was a kind generous and humble individual who was devoted to her Catholic faith.

To say that Margot was energetic would be an understatement. She worked tirelessly until stricken with ALS in 2015. Even then she continued working and helped to raise funds and awareness for ALS research while combating a brutal disease. She moved permanently to her dream home in Edgartown in 2019 and outlived her prognosis in valiant fashion.

Margot is survived by her husband of 35 years Thomas Vaughan; daughters Kirsten and Caroline; brother John Randazzo and his wife Judy; step-sons Lindsey and Christopher and their families; many cousins nieces and nephews; and her longtime caregiver and companion Natalee Miller.

Her funeral was held on August 10 at St. Mary’s Church in Winchester and she was interred at Oak Grove Cemetery in Medford.

Memorial donations can be sent to ALS research at Massachusetts General Hospital through sALSa for a Cure at because.massgeneral.org/campaign/salsa-for-a-cure/c150078 or Save a Dog at saveadog.org.

Controversial dating app The Right Stuff has released a bizarre video announcing the launch of the conservative platform in September – and the internet is losing its collective mind.

The Peter Thiel-backed company is another example in a growing wave of right-wing tech companies designed to emulate more mainstream platforms.

Just like many of its peers The Right Stuff very much resembles preexisting platforms such as Tinder Bumble and Hinge but with a slight twist: it’s only for conservatives.

The Right Stuff first hit the news in January following a $1.5m seed round from Thiel. At the time John McEntee the former Trump political aide behind the company said The Right Stuff aimed to launch in the summer.

However the bizarre announcement video unveiled on August 10 suggests that conservative singles waiting to match with like-minded people may have to wait for at least another month.

Ryann McEnany the younger sister of former Trump White House secretary Kayleigh McEnany stars in the video and said that The Right Stuff will launch in September.

Over the course of two minutes McEnany explains that the app is invite-only and free to use at least for the basic package.

“And for my ladies you’ll never have to pay as we all get premium subscriptions for simply inviting some friends” she smiles and points to the camera. “Gentlemen if you want access to premium that’s on you.

“And by the way those are the only two options: ladies and gentlemen. The Right Stuff is all about getting into the right dating pool with people who share the same values and beliefs as you.”.

Whilst explaining how to build the profile McEnany adds that there would be “no pronouns necessary”.

Over the sound of some stock music-like beats the viewer is then presented with a collage showcasing what supposed profiles could look like. The profiles are all of white people.

The collage also includes a picture of McEnany standing next to ousted former President Donald Trump.

The video also showcases how conservatives can create conversation starters by filling in different prompts. In one prompt shown in the video it says “Alexa change the…” to which fingers supposedly belonging to McEnany type in and finish the sentence with the word “president”.

“We’re sorry that you’ve had to endure years of bad dates and wasted time with people that don’t see the world our way the right way” she says.

The Right Stuff heckled on social media

The Twitterati descended upon the video within minutes of The Right Stuff posting it on the social media platform. Most of the people who commented on it did so in order to make fun of it.

“The normal dating apps thank you for removing this gene pool from their apps” one Twitter user said.

“SNL could just copy and paste this with literally no edits” another user commented.

A third user simply stated: “The Reich Stuff.”

One viewer noted that picture where McEnany was standing next to Trump.

“I’m confused why this ad features a photograph of an accused rapist and court-certified adulterer” one Twitter user said. “Does that represent [the kind] of community you’re trying to build?”

Trump has been accused of sexual assault sexual harassment and rape by at least 25 women since the 1970s as reported by Business Insider. He has denied the accusations labelling them as being politically motivated and a “total fabrication”.

Trump’s marriage to his first wife Ivana Trump fell apart when he began an affair with the model Marla Maples which dominated the tabloids in the early 1990s. He later married Maples.

Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult performer Stormy Daniels have alleged that Trump has had affairs with both of them early in his marriage with his third wife Melania Trump.

Dating apps are big business

While it’s easy to make fun of The Right Stuff the hammy video could be right in one way: it’s hard out there for right-wing singles.

That may sound odd given the abundance of apps at their disposal. If you’re a right-winger looking for love you can simply get an account on Tinder OkCupid Bumble Hinge and members-only sites like Raya and The League which was recently bought by Tinder-owner the Match Group.

The online dating industry is huge. The market was valued at $7.5bn in 2021 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5.5% from 2022 to 2030 according to research from Grand View Research.

Contrary to popular belief the pandemic actually proved a massive boost for the industry. With social restrictions shutting people off from the world around them lonely singles turned to these apps to meet new people.

“It almost became a necessity for single people” Lil Read research analyst at GlobalData recently told Verdict. “It was the only way you could meet new people. You couldn’t meet people in a bar you couldn’t meet them at a social club or anything like that. Everyone was indoors with lots of free time.”

However it seems like conservatives have gotten a raw deal: prospective partners increasingly shut off the conversation before they even get started by prompting Tories and Republicans to “swipe left” as reported by Vox.

Similarly Verdict has previously reported that people who state on their dating profile that they are vaccinated against Covid-19 or that they support Roe Vs Wade – both of which are opinions predominantly held by the left – tend to get more matches.

Bumble even introduced a tool in 2018 that enabled users to filter out potential matches that didn’t align with their political views.

The Right Stuff seemingly acknowledge this on its website saying: “Other dating apps have gone woke. We bring people together with shared values and similar passions.”

So if other dating platforms aren’t interested in making this group feel welcomed it makes sense that other companies step up to bat.

In fact The Right Stuff isn’t even the first right-wing dating app to see the light.

Donald Daters was launched in 2018 to give Trump supporters rejected by liberal singles a place to meet. Righter was launched in December that year with an almost identical mission.

Conservative tech backlash

The Right Stuff Donald Daters and Righter are arguably part of a wave of tech companies launched by conservatives after they’ve felt rejected by mainstream platforms.

Trump was kicked off Twitter for the role he allegedly played in the January 6 insurrection on Capitol Hill. Following his defenestration the former president launched his own social media platform called TRUTH Social. The company has been struggling with hacks and outages.

TRUTH Social is part of a wider project called Trump Media and Telecom Group which is positioning itself to rival Big Tech in a multi-pronged way. The new venture’s offerings will reportedly include social media platform a subscription video-on-demand service to compete with the likes of Netflix and Disney and services to rival AWS and Google Cloud.

The Right Stuff isn’t Thiel’s first conservative tech investment. He has also injected dosh int into the YouTube-like video-sharing app Rumble which has become a hit with conservatives because it has looser content moderation rules as Business Insider reported. Narya Capital also backed the YouTube clone.

GlobalData is the parent company of Verdict and its sister publications.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vYWV3LWJlc3QtdGl0bGUtbWF0Y2hlcy1kYXZlLW1lbHR6ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 10 Best AEW Title Matches According To Dave Meltzer,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vYWV3LWJlc3QtdGl0bGUtbWF0Y2hlcy1kYXZlLW1lbHR6ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL25vaXN5cGl4ZWwubmV0L2RlbW9uLXNsYXllci1raW1ldHN1LW5vLXlhaWJhLXRoZS1oaW5va2FtaS1jaHJvbmljbGVzLWFkZHMtbmV6dWtvLWthbWFkby1hZHZhbmNlZC1kZW1vbi1mb3JtLWdyb3VwLW1hdGNoZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Demon Slayer -Kimetsu No Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles' Adds Nezuko Kamado (Advanced Demon Form) & Group ...,"Sega has announced that the Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles Nezuko Kamado (Advanced Demon Form) Character Pack DLC is now available for purchase.

Throughout the 21/22 season Arsenal were followed by cameras as they became the latest subject in Amazon Prime Video’s ‘All or Nothing’ documentary series which will give fans a behind the scenes look at everything that went on at the club during that campaign.

Arsenal were gearing up to face City at the Emirates on New Year's Day but were without their manager after he tested positive for the virus for the second time.

Despite not being able to be present in the dressing room Arteta gave an epic pre match team talk through a Zoom call and it was captured by Amazon cameras. You can watch the footage here.

During the team talk he said: “I am really sorry I cannot be there because we are going to go to f*****g war today.

“One thing guys be yourselves I want a game with you face to face [with City]. I want to see [our] players confronting them.”

Advert

The Gunners boss then drew on their last outing against City to motivate his men.

He added: “When we were at the Emirates remember what they did...Three-nil down and with 10 players and they went f*****g putting [Riyad] Mahrez and [Raheem] Sterling on the pitch to humiliate you.

“Let's f*****g go for it guys. We are a completely different team and to go from the first minute think forward act forward and play forward… every f*****g one of you.

“I am proud of you. Let's go out there and win this f*****g match.”

Arsenal went out and produced a stellar first half performance as Bukayo Saka gave them a 1-0 half time lead.

However things began to unravel in the second half Granit Xhaka was penalised for a foul on Bernardo Silva in the box which meant City got their equaliser after Riyad Mahrez slotted in the penalty in the 57th minute.

Two minutes later Arsenal centre back Gabriel was sent off for a second bookable offence.

Despite being a man down Arteta’s side showed tremendous determination as the game approached the 90th minute it looked like they would be able to hold on for a draw but Rodri had other ideas.

City’s midfielder managed to poke the ball home in the third minute of stoppage time to sink the Gunners City won 2-1 and Arsenal’s efforts were in vain.

The first three episodes of the eight part series are now available to watch on Amazon Prime Video. With episodes four to six due to be released on Thursday August 11.

Meanwhile Arsenal have had a decent start to their 22/23 campaign after a 2-0 away win against Crystal Palace. They will host Leicester City at the Emirates this weekend.

On Day 1 of Steelers rookie minicamp at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex on the South Side McCormick worked primarily at right guard a position he barely played while with the Jackrabbits.

Though it remains to be seen if that’s his spot moving forward McCormick is ready for anything when it comes to the Steelers and whatever his role may be.

“I’m ready for whatever they throw at me” McCormick said to reporters on Day 1 of rookie minicamp according to video via Aaron Becker on Twitter. “I just wanna help the organization in any way that I can.”

They wanted us to be as versatile as possible and I think that’s something that can help all of us at the next level.” pic.twitter.com/4oZmz22TpB — Aaron Becker (@Aaron_M_Becker) May 10 2024

That’s largely been McCormick’s mindset since the Steelers drafted him in the fourth round at No. 119 overall.

Though he was primarily a left guard in college McCormick worked out for the Steelers as a center prior to the draft. Now he is getting work at right guard initially in the Black and Gold.

Snaps by position at SDSU for Mason McCormick per PFF Left guard = 3378 👀 Right guard = 19 Center = 15#Steelers #NFL — Steelers Depot 7⃣ (@Steelersdepot) April 27 2024

Having 3378 snaps at left guard seems like it would make for a difficult transition for McCormick to flip sides but that isn’t the case.

“At South Dakota State they prepared me for everything” McCormick said. “They wanted us to be as versatile as possible and I think that’s something that can help all of us at this level.”

It’s certainly going to help McCormick early on.

When the Steelers drafted him it made some sense that he could be the longtime answer at left or right guard with Isaac Seumalo turning 31 and James Daniels entering the final year of his contract as well as backup interior offensive lineman Nate Herbig entering the final year of his contract too.

McCormick’s versatility whether it’s at left guard center or right guard will be key. That should set him up for success long-term and will give Steelers offensive line coach Pat Meyer the ability to simply get the best five linemen on the field at once regardless of true position.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcmdhbmZoLm5ldC9vYml0dWFyeS9qb3NoLW1jY29ybWlja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary | Josh McCormick of Huntington West Virginia,"LEWISBURG WV - Joshua Howard McCormick 38 of Huntington WV formerly of Lewisburg WV passed away May 3 2024 at home.

While Fautanu and Frazier seem likely to start on Day 1 or at least early in the season McCormick to this point has been viewed more as depth across the interior offensive line. However NFL Media draft analyst Chad Reuter believes McCormick could potentially take over a starting spot at guard for the Steelers and believes the three rookie starters might be an improvement over last season’s offensive line.

“McCormick has the toughness and athleticism to take a starting spot from James Daniels or Isaac Seumalo. Yes that potentially means the Steelers would start three rookies on the offensive line but some Steelers fans might argue McCormick left tackle Troy Fautanu and center Zach Frazier will quickly constitute an improvement over last year’s group despite their lack of experience.”

I find it very very hard to believe that the Steelers would bench one of Seumalo or Daniels for McCormick. While there were some down moments for the most part the two were steady last season and among Pittsburgh’s best offensive linemen. Seumalo in particular brings leadership to a line that will still be very young and it’s really hard to fathom McCormick getting starter reps as a rookie.

Now could he compete with Nate Herbig for the top backup job at guard and potentially win it? Sure but even then McCormick is likely waiting for an injury to get his reps. The more realistic scenario here is that McCormick serves as depth and potentially as the team’s backup center behind Frazier as they worked him out at the position before the draft and he becomes a viable starting option after 2024 when Daniels’ contract will be up. The guard market got expensive in free agency this offseason and Daniels might be looking at a number the Steelers don’t want to pay. McCormick becomes insurance against them overpaying to keep Daniels around should he want a lot of money.

The selection of McCormick was an awesome one to help bolster Pittsburgh’s line depth and add a bully on the offensive line and it’s continually been praised since the draft concluded. But given what the Steelers currently have at guard it’s just hard to fathom the team benching two experienced starters who have been good in Seumalo and Daniels for McCormick. That doesn’t mean McCormick won’t one day be a starter but I’d be shocked if it happened in 2024 without injuries."
MCD,McDonald's,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15amV3aXNobGVhcm5pbmcuY29tL3RoZS1ub3NoZXIvd2h5LW1jZG9uYWxkcy1pcy13YXktYmV0dGVyLWluLWlzcmFlbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why McDonald's Is Way Better In Israel | The Nosher,"Kosher McDonald’s: for many young kashrut keepers this combination of words is the holy grail — you can find 62 kosher McDonald’s all across Israel (you can also find one kosher franchise in Buenos Aires FYI).

But is it worth visiting McDonald’s in Israel even if you don’t keep kosher? The answer to that is well absolutely individual but for this Israeli expat: yes.

The first McDonald’s in Israel opened in 1993 in my home city of Ramat Gan at the Ayalon mall — the location where I had my first ever McDonald’s — hallelujah! (Also if you like a good mall I highly recommend a visit to this recently renovated one.) Right now the chain has over 200 locations across the country.

You probably know that McDonald’s menus change around the world — in Italy McDonald’s serves espresso and in Canada the fast food chain serves poutine. Israel also has its own unique McDonald’s menu items which change seasonally and some of them may surprise you.

Israeli McDonald’s used to offer wraps and falafels but they don’t anymore. Truly why would anyone get falafel at McDonald’s when there is so much better falafel to be had at every corner! But there are some pretty great items that did withstand the test of time and popular opinion.

One item that seems to have stuck here in Israel and that isn’t available in the U.S. is the McDonald’s potato wedge or as they call it here the potato (say it with a Hebrew accent). I almost never order fries with my McDonalds here because the soft and crunchy texture and spiced flavors of the potato wedge are superior especially dipped in some cold mayo which your McDonald’s cashier will almost always offer along with your order.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CYEfwM8sZSV/

Another item that kids love here are corn sticks or corn nuggets. Israelis love their corn schnitzel or “schnitzel tiras” mass-produced and popularized by the Israeli vegetarian company Tivol. This McDonald’s variation is sweet and savory fried nuggets with pieces of corn inside and a crunchy breaded exterior. My toddler was a huge fan and I may or may not have nabbed a couple from him.

Like so much of the country most McDonalds in Israel are vegan-friendly. There’s a vegan burger option that I sampled and honestly found even better than the regular patty especially when served with their “spicy royale” sauce (yes McDonald’s outside the US call their quarter pounders the royale in case you haven’t seen “Pulp Fiction” — directed by Israeli local Quentin Tarantino — I wonder what his Israeli McDonalds order is?).

Israelis also have very strong feelings about health food — recently the Israeli ministry of health has added red stickers to food with high fat sodium and sugar content. So McDonald’s offers some traditionally “healthy” options like salad meals — of either a green salad or asian style cabbage salad topped with crunchy chicken chicken nuggets chicken breast fish fillet or the aforementioned corn nuggets. I tried one such salad and found it… sufficiently satisfying. The kids’ meals come with a fruit pouch or carrot sticks which you can also get as sides.

Some Americans might find the patty of kosher meat lacking — especially when Israel offers both kosher and unkosher burger places which serve excellent juicy burgers. But they do come with lots of fun toppings like mushrooms in an Asian marinade and onion rings — they also have New York Texas Tokyo and Amsterdam-style burgers with interesting sauce and topping combinations. When I last visited the chain it was offering a kebab burger which added some herbs and extra spice to the patty and honestly made it quite delicious.

The chicken products at McDonald’s are honestly pretty good — from nuggets to crunchy chicken to the recently reintroduced McChicken (there’s also a chicken filet that I have mixed feelings about). Israelis love their chicken so it makes sense that the chain is solid in that department.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CfnxzXOsIbu/

If you’re a McFlurry fan you can indeed get your cravings satisfied at the chain. This summer they introduced pistachio ice cream which I haven’t sampled and honestly don’t plan to (Israel has plenty of great ice cream!). But if you’re missing that good ole soft serve you can get your dose at most Israeli McDonald’s locations.

Overall McDonald’s in Israel is pretty good. If you’ve never had McDonald’s before for kashrut reasons what some call the “McBirthright” is a must — just for the experience. Israeli McDonald’s also offers gluten-free options though not at every location — so people with gluten sensitivity and celiac can have their own “McBirthright.”

But if you’ve had McDonald’s before I wouldn’t say you have to add it to your tight travel itenerary but I would definitely never discourage you from it. And you’re stuck in a mall with two kids like me visiting Israeli McDonald’s is unavoidable — so the good news is that you too can eat and hopefully love it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2NvYXRlcy1ncm91cC1uYW1lZC1tY2RvbmFsZHMtZ2xvYmFsLXByb3ZpZGVyLW9mLWRpZ2l0YWwtbWVudS1ib2FyZC1jb250ZW50LW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtc3lzdGVtLTMwMTYwNDUwNy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,COATES GROUP NAMED MCDONALD'S GLOBAL PROVIDER OF DIGITAL MENU BOARD CONTENT ...,"CHICAGO Aug. 11 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Coates Group a global technology company specializing in digital merchandising solutions was named as McDonald's single global Digital Menu Board (DMB) Content Management System (CMS) provider and one of two approved Digital Menu Board hardware providers alongside Acrelec Group.

After closing its restaurants in Ukraine six months ago because of the Russian invasion McDonald’s is starting to reopen in parts of the country.

“We have decided to institute a phased plan to reopen some restaurants in Kyiv and western Ukraine” Paul Pomroy corporate senior vice president of international operated markets wrote in a letter posted to the company’s website Thursday.

McDonald’s has nearly 110 restaurants in Ukraine. The chain has continued to pay its employees in the country despite the closures.

“Over the next few months we will begin working with suppliers to get product to restaurants making the physical properties ready to serve customers bringing restaurant teams and employees back on site and implementing enhanced procedures and protocols to support the safety of our people and customers” Pomroy said.

The decision was made after speaking with Ukrainian officials security specialists and suppliers he added.

McDonald’s was one of several global companies that paused operations in Ukraine due to the deadly conflict. In his letter Pomroy noted that other businesses have also reopened in Kyiv and western Ukraine.

The war prompted McDonald’s to permanently close its Russian restaurants. The chain announced it was pausing its Russia operations in March. In May the company said it would sell its Russian restaurants saying at the time that the “humanitarian crisis caused by the war in Ukraine and the precipitating unpredictable operating environment have led McDonald’s to conclude that continued ownership of the business in Russia is no longer tenable nor is it consistent with McDonald’s values.” The company has no plans to re-enter that market.

The company sold its hundreds of Russian locations to a local franchise operator who has started to reopen them with a new name “Vkusno & Tochka” which in English means “tasty and that’s it” along with new branding.

McDonald’s exit from Russia marked the end of an era. The chain opened its first location in Moscow in 1990 and is perhaps the most prominent example of glasnost former president Mikhail Gorbechev’s initiative to break down the barrier between the old Soviet Union and the rest of the world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL21jZG9uYWxkcy1yZW9wZW5pbmctcnVzc2lhLTk5MDFkYTViNmQyNjZkZDI5NmJmNDdiYWY0NWViMjZj0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's will reopen in Ukraine 6 months after invasion,"CHICAGO (AP) — McDonald’s will start reopening some of its restaurants in Ukraine in the coming months a symbol of the war-torn country’s return to some sense of normalcy and a show of support after the American fast-food chain pulled out of Russia.

The burger giant closed its Ukrainian restaurants after Russia’s invasion nearly six months ago but has continued to pay more than 10000 McDonald’s employees in the country.

McDonald’s said Thursday that it will begin gradually reopening some restaurants in the capital Kyiv and western Ukraine where other companies are doing business away from the fighting. Western businesses like Nike KFC and Spanish clothing retailer Mango are open in Kyiv.

“We’ve spoken extensively to our employees who have expressed a strong desire to return to work and see our restaurants in Ukraine reopen” Paul Pomroy corporate senior vice president of international operated markets said in a message to employees. “In recent months the belief that this would support a small but important sense of normalcy has grown stronger.”

The Ukrainian economy has been severely damaged by the war and restarting businesses even in a limited capacity would help. The International Monetary Fund expects Ukraine’s economy to shrink by 35% this year.

McDonald’s has 109 restaurants in Ukraine but didn’t say how many would reopen when that would happen or which locations would be the first to welcome back customers. Over the next few months the company said it will start working with vendors to get supplies into restaurants prepare those stores bring back employees and launch safety procedures with the war still raging to the east.

While it will start to reopen in Ukraine McDonald’s has sold its 850 restaurants in Russia to a franchise owner. That came three decades after McDonald’s opened its first location in Moscow becoming a powerful symbol of easing Cold War tensions.

McDonald’s had shuttered hundreds of Russian locations in March costing the company about $55 million per month. Selling its Russian restaurants was the first time the company has “de-arched” or exited a major market.

I grew up in Vietnam so I’ve never personally experienced such places myself. But for some of my friends it’s a place reminiscent of a ’ 90s childhood in America one that they have mixed feelings about. Some say these fast food parks were fun while others balk in disgust at the memory . Regardless of differing opinions the one thing they all agreed on was that they provided a sense of freedom—one that might now increasingly be slipping away.

These once ubiquitous indoor playgrounds have a complicated and fraught history. I nitially a source of excitement awe and relief they ultimately became a magnet for injuries fines and at least one vigilante mom . I t all began with that largest of fast food chains McDonald’ s.



The origin of fast food play areas

The 1970s was a time of great change both for America and for McDonald’s. During this decade the chain began marketing heavily toward children. Writing in Fast Food Nation Eric Schlosser describes McDonald’ s efforts to cultivate affinity for the brand .

“They have come to believe what Ray Kroc and Walt Disney realized long ago — a person’s ‘brand loyalty’ may begin as early as the age of 2” Schlosser wrote. This might explain why McDonalds hired Don Ament a renowned Hollywood set designer to design the first playground equipment that eventually debuted at the Illinois State Fair in 1972.

Aptly called McDonaldland it was wildly different than anything available for children at the time. Like stepping into a fantasy world McDonaldland’s design incorporat ed several characters that would continue to crop up in marketing materials for decades : Mayor McCheese Officer Big Mac the Hamburglar Evil Grimace Captain Crook and more. It was all intended to provide children with a memorable experience  one that created fond associations with McDonald’ s characters.

McDonaldland served as a precursor for what would become the play structures at McDonald’s locations nationwide . The original version called Playland was made of metal and designed for individual outdoor play. Toward the late ’ 80s however it was redesigned into a safer option called Play Place  an indoor contraption “protected by thick padding fabric and nets.”



O ther fast food chains soon followed suit  including Burger King and Chick-fil-A. The concept was so popular that in the early 19 90s McDonald’ s even created a standalone indoor playground separate from the restaurant itself. It was dubbed Leaps and Bounds; the first one opened in 1991 in Naperville Illinois a suburb of Chicago . With a $4.95 admission fee parents could let their children run free in a paradise of tubes ball pits and climbing walls for as long as they liked . But by 1994 McDonald’s merged Leaps and Bounds with Discovery Zone and Blockbuster Entertainment Corp effectively putting an end to its expansion efforts.

The decline of children’s play areas

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s many children climbed up giant metal hamburger buns and Big Mac–branded jungle gyms. Unbeknownst to many parents (and perhaps even McDonald’ s itself ) the play structures’ metal backing was rough on children. It resulted in more than 400 injuries that McDonald’ s failed to report to government authorities. By 1999 the company was facing a $4 million fine from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) two years after the last of the metal climbers were removed.

In addition to these safety concerns  customers began to question whether these play areas were cleaned and disinfected regularly. Stories both allegedly true and entirely fabricated began to circulate about children finding things like needles and used condoms during their time in the jungle gym  made worse by the fact that there were no federal or state regulations mandating the regular cleaning and upkeep of such play areas.



The lack of regulation was so disconcerting that it led one parent Dr. Erin Carr-Jordan founder of Kids Play Safe  to become a sanitation advocate. She was so convinced of play areas’ extreme filth that she traveled to several states and swabbed the equipment for samples  then sent it off to a lab with her own money. The result? Nearly all the areas she sampled were filled with some kind of bacteria.

Times are changing

The rise in public scrutiny coupled with the decline in families dining out (according to Eater it fell from 18.6% in 2011 to 14.6% in 2014) meant that children’s play areas became more of an insurance liability for fast food chains . Thus McDonald’ s began to shift its marketing away from kids toward millennials. ( Ironically millennials are the ones who grew up in the ’ 90s and are most likely to have been exposed to such play spaces.)

Today’s kids are exposed to more technology than ever before so their distractions while dining out might not need to be strictly physical—they can watch an iPad right at the table . Furthermore with the pandemic changing the way we shop and eat—that is more drive-t hr u and pick up orders—it’s no wonder that play areas are now something rare to be treasured like any good ol’ millennial memory.



So are there any fast food play areas left?

It depends on where you live . McDonald’ s has a page on its website w here you can filter location maps to only show those restaurants with a PlayPlace (either indoor outdoor or both) . Chick-fil-A’s FAQ page indicates that all of the chain’s play areas are closed “out of an abundance of caution .” However this information contradicts a local newspaper’s announcement of a Chick-fil-A play area that reopened at the Lake Travis location in Bee Cave Texas earlier this year. Burger King meanwhile  has no information listed on its website about whether or not its remaining play areas are still open.

T he best thing to do is to simply check with your local franchise owner before you arrive and maybe cross your fingers for the continued existence of these imperfect sources of fast food entertainment.

He will be replaced by Jason Hollar the company's chief financial officer. The promotion is effective Sept. 1.

""I am grateful for the privilege of serving alongside such a dedicated purpose-driven and talented team over the past three decades. It was truly the honor of a lifetime to serve as CEO of Cardinal Health these last five years"" Kaufmann said in a statement. ""The board and I are confident that Jason is the right person to lead Cardinal Health in the years to come.""

When Kaufmann 59 took over Dublin-based Cardinal and the other big whole drug distribution companies were being hit with lawsuits that charged the companies along with the drugmakers with stoking a national crisis by flooding the country with opioids. Kaufmann defended the company's actions while also acknowledging the pain of those hurt by the crisis.

""We care deeply about this crisis. We don't want to see anyone addicted"" he told The Dispatch a year ago.

Cardinal Health along with its fellow distributors McKesson and Amerisource Bergen and pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson announced a $26 billion settlement year ago. The money is expected to go to the states for opioid treatment and prevention programs.

Cardinal also was hit with surging costs for importing goods into the United States during the pandemic as shipping costs soared.

""Mike has been a tremendous leader during his tenure at Cardinal Health helping the company navigate a period of unprecedented challenges directing strategic investments for growth and innovation and cultivating an inclusive and vibrant workforce culture. We are grateful for Mike's many contributions over his more than 30 years of service and wish him the best in his future endeavors"" Gregory Kenny Cardinal's independent board chairman said in a statement.

Hollar 49 has served as the company's CFO for the past two years. Patricia English will serve as Cardinal Health’s interim CFO.

""This is a transformational period at Cardinal Health and I am humbled to have the opportunity to lead a business that plays such a vital role in the healthcare ecosystem"" Hollar said in a statement.

Also on Thursday the company reported revenue of $181.4 billion for its fiscal year ended June 30 a 12% increase from the prior year.

The company said it had a $596 million operating loss or $3.35 per share for the year because of noncash charges of $2.1 billion in its medical business.

Discounting those charges operating earnings fell 12% to $2 billion because of inflation and the global supply challenges. Earnings per share fell 9% to $5.06 per share.

Walgreens opioid epidemic lawsuit overview:

Who: Walgreens is responsible for helping to fuel the opioid epidemic in San Francisco a judge has ruled.

Why: The pharmacy was shown to have distributed hundreds of thousands of suspect opioid prescriptions without doing due diligence U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer says.

Where: The case was heard in a California federal court.

Walgreens the largest retail pharmacy chain in San Francisco distributed over 100 million prescription opioid pills in the city between 2006 and 2020 without properly checking which of the prescriptions were suspicious thus playing a role in the city’s opioid epidemic a California judge has ruled.

The company’s actions make it liable for the opioid problems that the Bay Area is dealing with to this day U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer ruled Aug. 10.

The ruling followed a bench trial this year brought by the City and County of San Francisco that initially featured several drug companies as defendants but led to a series of settlements for most leaving Walgreens as the sole defendant.

Walgreens did not check suspect opioid prescriptions city says

At trial San Francisco brought a single public nuisance claim against Walgreens Judge Breyer says.

He says the city had to establish that it is more likely than not that Walgreens knowingly engaged in unreasonable conduct that was a substantial factor in contributing to the opioid epidemic in San Francisco.

“After careful consideration of the evidence the Court finds that Plaintiff carried its burden” Breyer writes.

The evidence at trial established that from 2006 to 2020 Walgreens pharmacies in San Francisco dispensed over 100 million prescription opioid pills in the city his ruling states. Hundreds of thousands of them were red flag opioid prescriptions that Walgreens did not do the due diligence of checking.

Evidence showed that tens of thousands of these prescriptions were written by doctors with suspect prescribing patterns Breyer writes of the Walgreens opioid epidemic trial.

“In exchange for the privilege of distributing and dispensing prescription opioids Walgreens has regulatory obligations to take reasonable steps to prevent the drugs from being diverted and harming the public” he says. “The evidence at trial established that Walgreens breached these obligations.”

A subsequent trial will determine the extent to which Walgreens must abate the public nuisance that it helped to create the judge added.

Meanwhile national opioid settlements have been made as part of an effort by states and local political subdivisions to resolve the nationwide opioid crisis.

The settlements have put to bed claims brought against McKesson Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen — the nation’s three largest pharmaceutical distributors.

Claims against drug manufacturer Janssen Pharmaceuticals and its parent company Johnson & Johnson were also resolved as part of the national opioid settlement.

The Class I recall — the most serious classification from the FDA — is due to the potential for reduced shock energy during high-voltage therapy for Cobalt and Crome ICDs and CRT-Ds according to FDA data.

Some devices delivered only around 79% of the programmed energy which Medtronic estimates has a 1% reduction on efficacy.

Medtronic had no reports of permanent harm or deaths due to the issue.

In June Medtronic issued an urgent field safety notice in Europe warning of the same problem.

Medtronic is not recommending replacement of implanted devices. A software update is expected to fix the problem in new and existing implantations. Medtronic is asking hospitals to return certain non-implanted devices for inspection.

After receiving FDA approval and CE mark for the software update Medtronic started rolling the code out for in-clinic reprogramming of implanted devices and pre-installation on newly manufactured devices this month.

“Medtronic has instructed physicians to set these devices at maximum energy output (40 joules); by programming to maximum output the impact on the devices’ effectiveness is minimal (e.g. 99% efficacy to 98% efficacy) if the issue occurs” the company said in an email today.

More information on the recall is available at Medtronic’s website.

The original complaint (PDF) was filed late last year by Emery Feeser who received an Azure S DR MRI SureScan pacemaker manufactured by Medtronic in July 2018. However the lawsuit claims that the pacemaker failed due to the lack of a protective coating which was supposed to keep his body from rejecting it.

Medtronic attempted to have the lawsuit dismissed by arguing that Feeser’s claims were preempted by federal law. However a federal judge rejected that motion in February indicating that the lack of a protective coating which was specified in the FDA approval of the device meant Medtronic could not use prior approval of the product as a preemption defense.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuLm9yZy90ZWNobm9sb2d5YmFuay9mci9ub2RlLzExNzPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Earmold Lab launched at Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital (JDWNRH) Thimphu Bhutan | BANQUE ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.un.org/technologybank/fr/node/1173 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuLm9yZy90ZWNobm9sb2d5YmFuay9mci9ub2RlLzExNzPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL21lZGljYWxkaWFsb2d1ZXMuaW4vbmV3cy9pbmR1c3RyeS9waGFybWEvbWVkdHJvbmljLWluZGlhLXVudmVpbHMtYWktcG93ZXJlZC1naS1nZW5pdXMtbW9kdWxlLWZvci1jb2xvbm9zY29weS1vZi1jb2xvcmVjdGFsLWNhbmNlci05NzMwN9IBkwFodHRwczovL21lZGljYWxkaWFsb2d1ZXMuaW4vYW1wL25ld3MvaW5kdXN0cnkvcGhhcm1hL21lZHRyb25pYy1pbmRpYS11bnZlaWxzLWFpLXBvd2VyZWQtZ2ktZ2VuaXVzLW1vZHVsZS1mb3ItY29sb25vc2NvcHktb2YtY29sb3JlY3RhbC1jYW5jZXItOTczMDc?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Medtronic India unveils AI Powered GI Genius Module for Colonoscopy of Colorectal Cancer,"Mumbai: India Medtronic Private limited a wholly owned subsidiary of Medtronic plc has announced the launch of innovative computer-aided polyps detection system powered by artificial intelligence (AI) — the GI Genius intelligent endoscopy module.



""A transformative solution that leans on deep learning algorithms and real-time data the module empowers physicians to detect and treat colorectal cancer by offering enhanced visualization during colonoscopy"" the company stated. AIG hospital Hyderabad becomes the first hospital in India to utilize the enhanced screening feature with GI Genius.

As per GLOBOCAN 2020 colorectal cancer is the seventh deadliest cancer in India among both men and women. There is an increased incidence trend in India due to changing lifestyles that include consumption of calorie-rich processed food low fiber diet and lack of physical activity. Indian Council of Medical Research states Annual Incidence Rates (AARs) for colon cancer and rectal cancer in men are 4.4 and 4.1 per 100000 respectively. The AAR for colon cancer in women is 3.9 per 100000. Symptoms of colorectal cancer are difficult to identify and timely screening and diagnosis are important. Screening colonoscopy assisted with artificial intelligence can be a boon for early detection.

The GI Genius module uses advanced AI software to highlight suspicious polyps of various sizes shapes and morphologies with a visual marker in real-time. It serves as the gastroenterologists' ever-vigilant second observer with a sensitivity rate per lesion of 99.7% and less than 1% false positives.

""We heartily welcome the advent of GI Genius system by Medtronic in India and are extremely proud to be the first hospital in the country to utilize its enhanced screening feature for our patients. Technologically innovative and effective interventions such as these will play a significant role in enhancing our ability to combat the challenges arising from delayed diagnosis of colorectal cancer"" said Dr D. Nageshwar Reddy Chairman and Chief of Gastroenterology AIG Hospitals Hyderabad

""In line with its commitment to engineering the extraordinary Medtronic has consistently sought to offer novel transformative solutions that tap into the benefits of the latest technology and cutting-edge AI. The GI Genius is one such offering a powerful new ally in the fight against colorectal cancer assisting physicians to accurately detect occurrences and optimally care for their patients"" said Chandrashekhar Jaiman head of Specialty Therapies Medtronic India. ""Our vision continues to be informed by our fundamental goal of bringing disruptive innovations in the healthcare technology sector to alleviate pain restore health and extend life.""

Studies have shown that AI-assisted colonoscopy can increase polyp detection rates and every 1% increase in adenoma detection rate (ADR) reduces the risk of colorectal cancer by 3%. GI Genius module has been shown to increase ADR by up to 14.4%.

With elective procedure numbers rebounding after the darkest days of the COVID-19 pandemic sales at most of the world’s largest orthopedic device companies increased by double-digit percentages during their most recent fiscal years.

Here are the world’s 10 largest orthopedic device companies ranked by ortho business revenue pulled from their most recent annual reports:

Largest orthopedic device companies Annual revenue (% change) Headquarters 1 Stryker $17.1 billion (+19.2%) Kalamazoo Michigan 2 Johnson & Johnson – DePuy Synthes $8.6 billion (+10.6%) Locations: Raynham Massachusetts.; West Chester Pennsylvania; Warsaw Indiana; Palm Beach Gardens Florida 3 Zimmer Biomet (minus ZimVie spinoff) $6.8 billion (+11.6%) Warsaw Indiana 4 Medtronic – Cranial & Spinal Technologies $4.5 billion (+3.9%) Locations: Memphis Tennessee; Louisville Colorado 5 Smith+Nephew (Orthopaedics + Sports Medicine) $3.7 billion (+14.3%) London 6 Enovis (Formerly Colfax’s Medical Technology segment including DJO) $1.4 billion (+27.3%) Wilmington Delaware 7 NuVasive $1.1 billion (+8%) San Diego 8 Globus Medical $958 million (+21.4%) Audubon Pennsylvania 9 ZimVie (Spine business) $540 million (+2.1%) Westminster Colorado 10 Orthofix $465 million (+14.2%) Lewisville Texas

And here is more about how the world’s biggest orthopedic companies are doing:

1. Stryker

With a strong order book for capital equipment and implant sales momentum Stryker (NYSE:SYK) recently boosted its revenue projections for 2022 predicting organic sales growth between 8% and 9% for the year. The world’s largest orthopedic device company however scaled back its earnings range amid the foreign currency exchange environment. Like most manufacturers Stryker said its supply chain is presenting challenges too.

“We continue to invest in R&D at a healthy ratio of sales demonstrating our continued focus on new product pipelines” CEO Kevin Lobo said during Stryker’s Q2 2022 earnings call on July 26. Company officials are also excited about the synergies that Stryker is already realizing from its $3.1 billion acquisition of Vocera Communications a provider of digital care coordination and communication offerings including the hands-free Vocera Smartbadge.

At DeviceTalks Boston in May four Stryker executives shared how the company thinks differently about medical product development and how health care providers and patients will ultimately use them.

2. Johnson & Johnson – DePuy Synthes

DePuy Synthes officials see the Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) business better enabling the personalization of orthopedic surgery creating better outcomes. That was a big takeaway when five J&J executives spoke about the shift toward digital at DeviceTalks Boston in May. “We’re not adopting technology just for technology’s sake. We’re adopting technology because it’s meeting clear unmet needs” said Rajit Kamal worldwide president sports medicine/shoulder reconstruction at DePuy Synthes.

Recent DePuy Synthes wins include the Inhance system receiving FDA clearance for total shoulder arthroplasty and adding the Cementless Fixed Bearing knee and Medial Stabilized knee to its Attune Knee portfolio. The company is betting it can compete in the ortho surgical robotics space with its Velys system which could help reduce the physical burden of orthopedic surgery. Earlier this year DePuy Synthes acquired Tennessee-based CrossRoads Extremity Systems and its range of procedure-specific sterile-packed implants and instrumentation systems cleared for lower extremity indications.

3. Zimmer Biomet

Zimmer Biomet (NYSE:ZBH) has had a great deal of news over the past year. It spun off its dental and spine business as ZimVie in March. ZB has also introduced new ortho surgical offerings based on AI and mixed reality. They are also pioneering smart ortho device implants being the first to offer smart knee implants.

In early August Zimmer Biomet reported second-quarter results that handily beat the consensus forecast on Wall Street upping its full-year forecast for 2022. A host of U.S. companies in medtech and other industries are reporting macroeconomic headwinds related to foreign exchange rates inflation supply chain challenges and more. ZB officials however appear to be making a bet that they can innovate their way out of rough economic seas. CEO Bryan Hanson pretty much said it during the company’s Q2 earnings call: “We believe our focus on innovation and the transformation of our business continues to position us well for long-term growth and continued delivery for our shareholders.”

4. Medtronic – Cranial & Spinal Technologies

In the spine space Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) had record quarters with its Mazor robotics system and StealthStation navigation system CEO Geoff Martha said during the medtech giant’s Q4 earnings call in May. “The ongoing launch of our Catalyft expandable titanium interbody system and the rollout of our enabling technologies continues to differentiate us in spine” Martha said. Recent spine wins for Medtronic include FDA 510(k) clearance and breakthrough device designation for its LigaPASS 2.0 ligament augmentation system for spine surgery and FDA clearance of its UNiD spine analyzer v4.0 planning platform. On the flip side the spine business was facing slowing distributor purchases in China ahead of a potential national volume-based tender as the Chinese government seeks to rein in healthcare costs.

5. Smith+Nephew

The most recent earnings report from Smith+Nephew (NYSE: SNN) showed an overall loss in revenue and its orthopedics business experienced a revenue decline of 1.1% in Q2 noting supply chain challenges and a new hip and knee volume-based procurement program in China. However company officials say they have a strategy to grow the orthopedics business.

“Orthopedics continues to be held back by execution and supply chain challenges” CEO Deepak Nath said in a recent earnings release. “In the last three months I have reviewed the business and together with the team we have developed a comprehensive plan to drive better execution at pace.”

The plan includes initiatives such as driving operational benefits in orthopedics and transforming the business. Smith+Nephew also recently invested in its orthopedics business by building a new $100 million manufacturing facility in Malaysia.

6. Enovis

Enovis (NYSE:ENOV) — the parent company of DJO Global — completed acquisitions and spinoffs this year to strengthen its position in the orthopedic device industry.

In May the company acquired assets of Outcome-Based Technologies‘ hip and knee bracing portfolio adding the Excyabir hip brace and CryoKnee knee braces to its DonJoy bracing brand.

Enovis also completed the acquisition of Insight Medical and its FDA-cleared Arvis augmented reality platform for hip and knee replacement surgery earlier this month.

In early August the company reported Q2 results that beat The Street on earnings but missed on revenue. It joined the host of medtech companies scaling back earnings projections for the year amid macroeconomic headwinds.

7. NuVasive

NuVasive (Nasdaq:NUVA) remains on track to grow its revenue more than 6% in fiscal 2022 and its orthopedic technology is expected to drive the growth. However the company reduced its EPS guidance in early August amid the macroeconomic pressures that many device companies presently face.

Early this year NuVasive announced that its Attrax Putty had received FDA 510(k) clearance for expanded indications in thoracolumbar interbody spine surgery. NuVasive officials say the Attrax Putty is the first synthetic bone graft with U.S. FDA indications for thoracolumbar interbody fusion. The company also describes Attrax as a relatively inexpensive biologic option. The spine surgery tech company in July released some positive data around Attrax and Modulus XLIF a porous titanium interbody implant when it came to lateral lumbar interbody fusions. Nuvasive said the fully porous architecture provided a favorable environment for bone in-growth and supported a less invasive XLIF procedure that was clinically and economically beneficial.

In April NuVasive reported successful data that demonstrated significantly greater success rates with its Simplify disc at the 24-month follow-up compared to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion when used for two-level cervical total disc replacement. The implant allows for enhanced visualization through MRI postoperatively compared to alternative devices.

8. Globus Medical

Globus Medical (NYSE:GMED) during its second quarter delivered on a needed rebound after a Q1 earnings miss and a surprise CEO transition said BTIG analyst Ryan Zimmerman as he kept his Buy rating on GMED shares. “To some extent investors are flying blind in terms of where GMED is heading longer-term strategically (and how it reaccelerates core spine) but at the same time we expect GMED to drive growth through competitive rep hires pull through from Enabling Technology and new product introductions; all of which are expected to pick-up as we move into FY23.”

Globus Medical reaffirmed its full-year 2022 guidance of $1.025 billion in net sales and non-GAAP EPS of $2.10.

The company reached another milestone in its business earlier this year with the first shipments of its Excelsius3D imaging system. Globus Medical announced the first procedures using the system in May. The mobile X-ray system is designed for 2D fluoroscopy 2D digital radiography and 3D imaging of adult and pediatric patients. When combined with its ExcelsiusGPS the image-guided robotic navigation improves implant placement accuracy.

Early feedback was “extremely positive” CEO Dan Scavilla said in May. He called the imaging system “an excellent example of Globus Medical’s innovation engine which will drive momentum and provide a platform for continued growth as we progress in 2022 and beyond.”

9. ZimVie (spine business)

Zimmer Biomet’s latest spinoff ZimVie (NYSE:ZBH) became an independent public company on March 1 nearly 13 months after Zimmer Biomet announced the move.

ZimVie reported $540 million worth of spine sales for calendar year 2021 while the spinoff’s other business — dental — did $469 million for the year.

CEO Vafa Jamali earlier this year said there are opportunities for growth in the spine space but the efforts could take years to accomplish. Two examples of the growth opportunity are cervical disc replacement and pediatric scoliosis treatments.

The former Medtronic executive also set his sights on “some operational issues to fix within our spine business” saying ZimVie would exit several countries where the business has been unprofitable.

“That opens up a ton of management time and energy. It just frees us up. … We’re doing a lot of work with our inventory and how we manage our sets. So this really gives us a chance to sort of stabilize and then to grow from there.” Jamali said. “We’re going to have a year of resetting and sorting out all these pieces. And then you’ll see us accelerate on some of the more innovation-focused areas and goals.”

Facing greater than anticipated foreign exchange headwinds ZimVie announced during its Q2 earnings report that it is reducing its full-year revenue forecast to $915 to $930 million versus prior guidance of $1 billion.

10. Orthofix

Orthofix (Nasdaq:OFIX) named Kimberley Elting as its global orthopedics business president in April. Eluting was previously chief legal and development officer and held other leadership roles in the areas of regulatory and quality business development and corporate communications at the orthopedic implant purveyor.

In May Orthofix said it received FDA premarket approval (PMA) for its AccelStim bone healing therapy device. In July the company announced a licensing partnership with LimaCorporate to combine the limb-lengthening technology of Orthofix’s Fitbone intramedullary nail system with LimaCorporate’s proprietary patient-specific 3D-printed pelvic fixation device. The company most recently launched its Virtuos Lyograft autograft substitute and marked the first clinical use.

The company in early August lowered its financial outlook for the year. It now anticipates fiscal 2022 net sales to be in the range of $455 million to $465 million down from its previous outlook of $475 million to $490 million.

Said CEO Jon Serbousek: “We had solid operational execution despite the challenges that macro headwinds continue to present including continued hospital staffing shortages complex spine procedure softness and patients deferring care due to economic pressures. In addition currency fluctuations during the quarter dampened reported revenue results.”

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-treatment-type-uterus-cancer-fails-trial-2024-05-09/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

Yuval Boger: Hello Thomas and thank you for joining me today.

Thomas Ehmer: Hi Yuval pleasure.

Yuval: So who are you and what do you do?

Thomas: That’s a good question Yuval and because I know the podcast I prepared a bit. I’m a bit of a superposition and it depends really on whom you ask. So for my band I’m the keyboard player for my kids I am the dad. But I think for this podcast I’ll tell you what I’m doing in my business. I’m one of the co-founders in the Merck group Merck KGaA. We are not Merck & Co. so there are two different independent companies. We have to tell this every time. So if you listen from the US we operate under EMD Serono. Rest of world we are Merck KGaA. And some eight years ago I was looking for novel technologies. I’m still looking for novel technologies and we did found a quantum task force with the objective to check if it makes sense that our company takes care of quantum technologies. It does. Yeah and then I’m a physicist by training. I look mainly at all applications that are novel to our company and should make sense. I’m a bit of a troublemaker because I bring technologies in-house that we don’t know yet how to use or we want to use but don’t have budget and so on. So that’s what I do for a living. Eight years

Yuval: wow.

Thomas: Yes.

Yuval: Really one of the pioneers. So let’s go back eight months. What have you learned in the last eight months about quantum and quantum readiness that maybe you didn’t know before that?

Thomas: Eight months is February. What did I learn in the last eight months? So I think what is confirming is that we have a very good emerging quantum computing community. I very much like all these conferences and it’s always good to see that we independent on whom you ask it seems that we are a community who wants to work together. Yeah and I think this is as some might say we approach quantum winter. We don’t know. But I think it’s good to see that there are still some brave people who carry the flag and work together. I see also that a lot of novel quantum computing architectures make it close to the market or are close to the market. So it’s really good to see. And I mean personally I was keen to see the recent announcement from Quantinuum for example where they have for example logical qubits apparently entangled. Eight years ago we didn’t even know how to build a single qubit. Now we have logical qubits at least in some claim that they have and I trust them. So this is interesting to see. And also the quantum communication part people are really getting keen on all these quantum key distribution communication protocols and so on. So that’s yeah. There’s not a single thing. I think it’s just really exploding. That’s good to see how far we move.

Yuval: In your company what do you see as the key application for quantum? Is it drug discovery or is it more things like optimization supply chain and so on?

Thomas: It depends on whom you ask. So we are super interested in quantum applications because once they come if ever they come they might be transformative. There’s so much hope and hype on drug discovery. Personally I’m not really a big fan or believer that computational drug discovery is outperforming wet drug discovery. So that’s my personal take. I think it’s a partnership and everybody’s betting on artificial intelligence. So drug discovery is a very complex thing and computational methods. Quantum computing is an additional computational method. So I think it’s a long way. There’s a very good paper out from the colleagues from Boehringer who did investigate if quantum computing ever will work. So it looks like we need new algorithms. So that’s my take. And the other problems logistics problems this is how it started for me actually to dive into quantum computing. So some years back the D-Wave were the first ones on the market with their traveling salesperson optimization. I still think it’s a miracle that we have these annealing things. And apparently so these ultra wicked complex problems might benefit also from quantum computing. I’m a bit undecided. I mean we see the three classes simulation optimization and machine learning. And yeah for our company none of them currently is relevant from an application perspective. But if they will come to maturity likely the material sciences is also of important.

Yuval: It’s very popular these days to talk about chat GPT moment a moment where AI moved from science fiction to we got to do it now. What do you think the quantum chat GPT or the quantum GPT moment is going to look like?

Thomas: The quantum that I have no clue. So I think the GPT moment was when everybody and their sister and brother were exposed to a functionality they could never imagine which is mimicking human intelligence. Actually it does not but it’s mimicking and it’s very convincing. So I think we will see how this develops compared to quantum. I have actually no clue. I could imagine that eventually something like this communication protocols might have an impact if everybody could just plug in whatever app to have a quantum secured point to point communication without any agency being able to listen in without me knowing they listen in. So this might be eventually one of these which has mass impact because I think quantum computing per se is rather an expert-ish niche co-processor thing. So I’m not sure how to. It’s a good question. I have to ask my guys what they think.

Yuval: You mentioned community earlier. And I know you’re part of a community of several I think German companies that work together to develop quantum. Could you tell me a little bit about that? And also related to that are you worried about other pharma companies about collaborating with other pharma companies to do quantum or right now a rising tide lifts all boats?

Thomas: Yes. So the yes is to the last question. So the company you mentioned at the beginning so it’s an association called QUTAC stands for German Quantum Technology Application Consortium. We have a very cool homepage. And it’s an association of the 13 big German companies. I don’t want to mention them all because otherwise the podcast would be over. What we are doing we organize ourselves in several streams and with the focus to identify quantum technology use cases that we could work on either as developers or co-developers or application user guidance for the developers. Independent from our own let’s say business. For example we work together with automotive or pharma and reinsurers logistics companies on let’s say logistics problems. Everybody has their problems and we test out different approaches on knapsack etc. So that’s one thing. And the other thing is we share the burden to evaluate vendors potential service providers. And by being attractive enough if as a partner you manage to convince QUTAC you not only have one customer but you would have 13 customers. So that’s the main point. And also I think it’s very helpful. All of us have relatively small quantum teams. So these are big worldwide corporations. I mean BMW SAP Bühringer etc. And all have relatively small quantum teams. And it’s very comfortable for us as a team to not be alone so that we have a bit of a peers and we can share interests. Regarding the pharma guys I mean it started I think at the Q2B several years back. There was an initiative that we all say everybody claims we can speed up drug discovery or drug development or we can bring better drugs to the world by quantum computing. Who knows how this works? Nobody did. So it’s also very open very collaborative. And I think it’s rather a friend-ish approach bosonic approach that we work together instead of competition because currently it’s really pre-competitive. There’s also the Pistoia Alliance who is setting up one pharma consortium thing. There are several pharma consortiums emerging. So that’s quite open. And the third part I forgot. Now I think you answered everything here.

Yuval: When you think about QUTAC what is the issue that you’re facing right now? What is the key thing that you’re looking for a solution?

Thomas: So we have different streams. So one stream we started focusing on the logistics and the material sciences streams. It looks like currently we have reshuffled a bit. So one part of us is looking at generative components. So we’re working on quantum generative network so QGANs to check in how far they perform better than classical GANs. We have a paper out. You can make sense yourself if it’s worthwhile or not. I mean it’s early days but this is where we jointly work on because everybody is interested of course in these generative networks. The other thing is in the logistics part we work on knapsack problems to understand can quantum do better knapsack things. And there’s another stream which is composed of different people. They work mainly on material science topics so quantum chemistry using quantum computers. I don’t have too much insight in that but it’s always shared problems that we say how can you better do ground energy finding whatever. What is quantum Monte Carlo? Where does it make sense? Where does it not make sense? And the third stream I mentioned is really looking at infrastructure from different perspectives. So we are also writing there some papers with the target audience of being other quantum computing users to guide them if it makes sense to go on neutral atoms. I mean you know neutral atoms or we’re just working on an ion trap paper. And the other part is also political communication. And in principle also we wanted to do a bit of education so help grow talent for our companies. But that’s not so far progressed as we would have wanted just due to the lack of resource we have.

Yuval: You mentioned the comparison between computational chemistry or using quantum computing for computational chemistry versus wet labs. In a company like Merck how much communication is there between the people who are actually working on developing drugs and people like yourself who are dealing with future technologies?

Thomas: That’s a good question. So I think there is enough communication. There is even a common ground. There are just not enough solutions. I mean we have recently discussed the potential to do I don’t know what was this the idea to use quantum computer annealing approaches to find binding pockets in complex targets. And when I talk to our researchers who do the wet stuff or other computational stuff they said it sounds interesting. On the other hand we already have 15 methods or 20 methods and I have 15 people so I just don’t have capacity to digest this. So I think there is an appetite that it’s really tough to understand this added value given that you have new ways of thinking. So quantum algorithm is using quantum features nobody really understands what these are even the quantum guys don’t. And then I mean how to translate your existing problems in a way that you can make additional value for using quantum components or quantum core processor. That’s not easy. And unfortunately most have objectives that are not so much forward looking and have time to think what will be happening in 10 5 years because in the end you need to deliver the next target. And it’s just a bit of operational pressure. I mean it’s a bit of a dance and mainly of interest so people listening with interest but it’s just currently it’s more playful with the intent to detect good things but it’s not a threat currently if we would not look at it I think.

Yuval: Do you see a need for a company like Merck to purchase a quantum computer anytime soon in the next few years or everything is on the cloud as far as you’re concerned?

Thomas: I mean there are different answers to that. I think it depends on what you want to achieve so if we want to contribute as a material supplier for example because we have the very best isotopes and the very best gas to do nitrogen vacancy whatever stuff well so do we need a quantum computer for that? Maybe not. If we want to learn to program it there are so many solutions out in the cloud. I doubt that we need one in-house. And then there’s on the other hand the approach that the American clinics currently are doing. So every clinic who thinks they have interest in novel technologies they put a quantum computer on site which is then I think rather a symbol because if every day you pass a quantum computer eventually it triggers your way of thinking what could I do with it? So I think for this sake more as a symbol it could make sense. And I mean it looks good. The machines depending on which machines you use but I think definitely from a productive use point it doesn’t make sense this moment in time. I would not even know whom to hire to maintain and operate these things because they are very fragile and you need to calibrate all these. And then the question is also which technology do you want to have? So you would need to buy one of each flavors modalities how they’re called. I would not know what to choose. So therefore I think it’s also not from a financial investment. Maybe it’s not a good value investment because the next generation makes the other one obsolete. So it’s not that it’s getting more and more from a collector’s viewpoint that you can collect. I have the very first I don’t know a QuEra machine and then I put it somewhere. I have the very first IBM machine with 127 qubits. I think it doesn’t make sense.

Yuval: Germany is one of the countries that’s investing heavily in quantum on the national level. And do you feel some of the results of this investment or do you think it’s going to be years out?

Thomas: So personally I feel some of it because I’m also profiting from a federal funded project which I’m very grateful for because otherwise we would not do this project because it’s just too risky. And because we have this funding I can spend part of my time to think on things I would not think for. And the interesting part is that I think we heard this on several talks also on conferences that because you think on quantum algorithms you detect sometimes solutions that are completely independent from quantum that help your business nevertheless. So that’s one aspect. Do I see other… I mean Germany spends a lot of money. The UK does France does. Others do too. I can’t really say that I have seen quick returns but I see that there is a lot of attention and even a bit of understanding in the decision makers. It’s moving into a direction which is at least they want to understand what it is and it’s quite complex but I think it’s more technology friendly these days than it was in the past. Unfortunately we have the situation in the world. So I think everywhere funds are cut for fundamental research. But I mean that’s I think independent from the aim that we want to spend much money on that. I mean one thing on the other hand is what I find a bit disappointing is that we have a bit of this fragmentation in Germany. We have all the land and everybody wants to do their own valley. So we have a quantum valley in Munich we have a Saxony valley. So in Germany everybody is a bit of building their own center and everybody is in the center of their world. I’m not sure how this is in other countries. I think France is by definition different that everything goes to Paris and then you have to see what’s coming out there. But the original question is yes I think it makes sense. You slowly see. I think we’re a bit far behind. Others started earlier and have more mature startup scenes but we’re catching up.

Yuval: You spoke earlier about the quantum winter and also mentioned that you’ve been doing this for eight years. Do you think there is a risk that a company like Merck says you know what we’ve been at this for a while. Let’s shelve it and come back in three years and maybe things will be different.

Thomas: I think there is in principle the risk because we are not doing this as a profession. Everybody’s doing this as their hobby. We have a very small team under our digital just forget but we have a central function and we have a digital unit. And somewhere in this area we have a unit who is doing quantum and AI lab. And these are not many people. And they spend a very small part of the time doing what they do. And what I’m doing thanks to my boss and my boss’s boss and everything so I am doing this on top of my job. I have zero budget except the federal funding so there is not much to cut. Because otherwise it’s late in the evening we have this call after business hours. So I think many people are committed despite not having money because it’s not like in other companies where you have a really a small team and hire a few students. For us it’s relatively small. And I rather see that we are doing more than is visible to the top management. And when we did this task force people were surprised how active we are. If you’re not in the field of course you don’t see it. But then when you say we should do something about quantum computing you see that we’re relatively well networked. I think that’s… Does this answer the question?

Yuval: Absolutely. So hypothetically if you could have dinner with one of the quantum greats dead or alive who would that person be?

Thomas: I’m prepared so I’m not so… I don’t fake surprise. And it took me a long time to think. And I’m in a very lucky position that I already had lunch with some of my idols they’re alive. Therefore I go for the dead ones. And this is a tough thing. I think I would go for David Bohm or John Wheeler because I really like the way they put more into quantum which has to do with consciousness research self-perception the miracles of the observer what is the observer so the bigger picture. Currently I’m tending in my philosophical interpretation of the word a bit to the monistic view which is maybe a bit over-exaggerated. But the miracle that we have something which is self-perception and we have something which is an external world. And how come? We don’t know. And there are so many different interpretations and I think Bohm did a very good… with his implicate order he had a very good idea to think about that we need new ways of expressing ourselves if I understood this correct. And I’ve seen some rare interviews back on YouTube with him and he seems to be a very super interesting person. But he’s dead unfortunately so no chance.

Yuval: Very well. Thomas thank you so much for joining me today.

But according to Meta Platforms Inc. (ticker: META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg it's not only the future of how humans and businesses will interact digitally but also of the company he created as a website called ""The Facebook"" in his Harvard dorm room in 2004.

As Facebook grew and bought competitors to become a social media conglomerate that is now one of the biggest companies in the world it made sense that it would change its name similar to the way Google did to become Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL GOOG).

The name Meta Platforms says quite a bit about where Zuckerberg wants to take the company. But it also encapsulates the unknowns facing the company over the long term. Here are some factors investors need to understand as they consider whether or not to buy Meta stock:

Meta Stock at a Glance

By 2007 Facebook was valued at $15 billion; by 2010 it was worth $41 billion. When the company went public in May 2012 at $38 a share it was worth a staggering $104 billion. Its market capitalization now even after losing about half of its value this year is more than four times that.

The company had more than 1 billion monthly active users by December 2012. More important Facebook acquired Instagram for $1 billion in August 2012. Instagram's focus on photographs and mobile users not only proved prescient but also paired well with Facebook's growing mobile base.

Finding up-and-coming companies with services that complemented its own was an effective strategy for Facebook over the years. Following its purchase of Instagram it acquired WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion. Back then WhatsApp was one of the fastest-growing companies in the world and Facebook was happy to not only gain an incredibly popular new service but also remove WhatsApp as a competitor for Facebook Messenger.

This too would prove to be a shrewd move for Facebook and its family of apps. According to App Annie the four most downloaded apps in the world from 2010 to 2019 were Facebook Facebook Messenger WhatsApp and Instagram in that order. Even in Meta's less-than-stellar second quarter of 2022 daily active users across its family of apps were up 4% from the previous year.

During the pandemic people spent more time on the internet and Facebook was one of the prime beneficiaries. That trend and the economic recovery from the pandemic helped boost Meta's quarterly revenue to a record high of more than $33.6 billion in the last quarter of 2021. Its total annual revenue that year was nearly $118 billion a rise of nearly 40% over 2020.

But as for many companies fortunes have changed this year as the economic recovery ushered in the highest inflation in years and the Federal Reserve's campaign to rein it in has raised the specter of a recession which we may already be in depending on who you ask.



What's the Deal With the Metaverse?

It's too early to list Zuckerberg's bet on the metaverse the envisioned immersive computer-generated three-dimensional world that will rely on virtual and augmented reality as a pro or a con. At worst it's a risk that won't pan out; at best it's an unknown that leads to a new era of growth for one of the world's most successful companies.

On the one hand Zuck one of the most brilliant minds in technology could well prove naysayers wrong. On the other hand the metaverse may not pan out to be as big of a deal as he's thinking. Perhaps somewhere in between is a metaverse populated by many competitors where Meta's virtual reality hardware doesn't play a dominant role.

""We don't pretend to know how the metaverse ecosystem will look in five years"" says Kenneth Landau CEO of Mytaverse a cloud-based metaverse platform that creates 3D work environments. People may enter the metaverse not only from virtual reality headsets like those made by Meta but also from mobile devices and desktops says Landau. That means competition for sales of headsets.

""In 10 years we believe most of Meta's 3 billion users will likely connect through 3D platforms known as the metaverse; it's just unlikely most of them will enter the metaverse via Meta's headsets"" he says.

For now Meta is in investment mode when it comes to building its metaverse offerings and that means spending money. That's not necessarily a bad thing in a similar way to how many startup companies no matter how hot take a while to turn a profit. And in the case of Meta its Reality Labs ""startup"" is a segment snugly housed in a $450 billion advertising behemoth where it won't lack for funding.

Still the Reality Labs segment which contains augmented and virtual reality hardware software and content is a drain on Meta's profitability. In Meta's most recent quarter the unit lost $2.8 billion bringing total income from operations down from $12.4 billion to $8.4 billion year over year.

""For a company that seems to have gone all-in on the metaverse its virtual reality venture so far is undoubtedly worrying"" says Sam Boughedda a trader and stock market writer with trading information platform AskTraders.com.

Cons of Buying Meta Stock

Zooming back in to the immediate term the No. 1 headwind facing Meta is declining advertising revenue. During the second quarter the price Meta could fetch per ad declined 14% year over year contributing to a 1% decline in overall revenue the company's first sales dip since it went public in 2012.

In response to waning e-commerce demand the war in Ukraine and rising inflation businesses have been forced to decrease their advertising budgets says Wes Gottesman market advisor at trading platform TradeZing.

""Now that the Fed has instituted a second historic rate hike and as the policy's effects become pervasive throughout the economy expect demand for Meta's ads to continue to drop"" says Richard Gardner CEO of Modulus Global which provides financial software to brokerages and professional traders.

""We're either in or about to enter a recession and during recessions most firms cut down on advertising"" Landau says.

In addition to the economic headwinds Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) iOS rule changes on collecting user data have also dented Meta's ability to sell ads he says. A Meta executive earlier this year said the company expects Apple's policy to cost it more than $10 billion in sales this year.

""Add increased competition from TikTok and Snap and Meta is facing the most headwinds in its history"" says Landau who also notes that the announced departure of Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg is a headwind.

And that's not all. Meta also faces regulatory risk such as from a Federal Trade Commission antitrust lawsuit that 46 U.S. states have joined.

""Of increasing concern is the broad and bipartisan shift in tone from U.S. regulators and lawmakers regarding big tech/media"" ratings agency Moody's Investors Service said earlier this month in a note rating Meta's inaugural bond issuance. ""Investigations launched by the Justice Department and the House Judiciary Committee are looking into big media/tech more broadly.""



Pros of Buying Meta Stock

But just because there are some choppy waters doesn’t mean the boat is anywhere near sinking.

""While there are headwinds Meta is still an enormous company and analysts predict its advertising revenue growth will eventually stabilize and weather the storm which would be a significant plus for investors"" Boughedda says.

Plus the stock has an attractive valuation after falling around 50% so far this year ""although I would still be looking for positive catalysts"" Boughedda says.

Gottesman says the company is ""an excellent long-term stock choice"" with a price target of $215 per share. As of Aug. 9 ""the stock is trading in the $168 range so now would be the time to buy and plan to hold"" he says.

Gottesman says ad revenue from the company's Reels short-form video platform will grow over time and its click-to-message advertising method is also promising. Those types of ads send people who click on a certain area directly into a conversation with a business in Messenger Instagram or WhatsApp.

""Meta's user numbers in general will grow as the world transitions to digital"" Gottesman says. ""The world is changing as it moves toward a digital means of interaction and business. Meta is at the forefront of this change.""

Bottom Line: Should You Buy Meta Stock?

Weighing the pros and cons and looking at the potential for the metaverse it seems as if long-term investors who don't have any shares of Meta stock may want to pick some up while they're so much cheaper than they were last year.

""Meta is a stock that belongs in an investor's portfolio assuming it meets their risk tolerance"" Gottesman says.

Even if you strip out the metaverse concept the company still brings in lots of money from advertising which will eventually bounce back along with the economy. And for those who believe in the future of the metaverse Meta is a premier stock to play that idea as long as you're patient.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vY2FtcGFpZ25zYW5kZWxlY3Rpb25zLmNvbS9jYW1wYWlnbnRlY2gvaG93LXRvLWFkYXB0LXlvdXItZGlnaXRhbC1zdHJhdGVneS10by1tZXRhcy1sYXN0LW1pbnV0ZS1wbGF0Zm9ybS1jaGFuZ2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Adapt Your Digital Strategy to Meta's Last-Minute Platform Changes,"Campaigns are abuzz about the big changes Meta is making to its platforms — starting with their flagship product Facebook. Meta is clearly feeling the heat from TikTok and other emerging platforms and is desperate to maintain its drifting user bases.

As a result Facebook will be focusing much more on vertical short-form video. The Home tab will turn into more of a “discovery” area and will include photos looping videos and status updates from friends as well as content that is labeled as “Suggested for You.”

For anyone who uses Instagram often I’m sure this sounds familiar. To view content only from friends family or followed pages people will need to navigate to the Feeds tab.

So what does this mean for causes and candidates as we approach the midterm elections? It’s no coincidence that Meta is making changes (with more to come) ahead of November given their troubling influence on prior elections domestically and globally.

Our team has been studying the latest announcements. Here’s some advice that we’ve been sharing with clients:

Vertical short-form video will be even more prioritized by platforms. As more content in this format floods the digital space algorithms will push content of the highest quality.

by platforms. As more content in this format floods the digital space algorithms will push content of the highest quality. We encourage campaigns to post all ads and videos organically .

. Captions should always be included on videos and formatted for the platforms.

and formatted for the platforms. Testing prior to full launch is even more critical for successful targeting.

for successful targeting. More changes are on the horizon. We are monitoring conditions for cause and candidate-focused ads. We’ll keep our community posted on our blog our Twitter feed and our LinkedIn page as developments arise.

Make no mistake: Meta’s platforms remain important as community builders and info disseminators. In addition to the five points above we also recommend focusing more attention on relevant Facebook Groups and reaching out to increasingly powerful influencers on Instagram to help amp donations and create more momentum for GOTV programs in this historic election.

Meta is always shifting its algorithm to make political and issue-based advertising challenging and nuanced on its platforms. Savvy organizers and communicators have long understood the necessity of zigging and zagging creatively to ensure sharp performance.

The stakes for our democracy and our freedoms remain high and once more it’s critical to test before unleashing ads to ensure you’re motivating your target audiences at the appropriate levels.

Ibrahim al-Nabulsi a senior commander of Fatah's al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade was killed on 9 August by Israeli forces during an army raid in the occupied West Bank city of Nablus and subsequent exchanges of fire along with Islam Sobhi and Hussain Jamal Taha.

Images of Nabulsi went viral following the news of his death. Yet a number of Palestinian journalists and activists who shared photos and videos of Nabulsi said their posts were banned on Meta-affiliated social media platforms.

They said Instagram and Facebook began deleting and censoring photos of the ""martyrs"" and their families following the killings. Posts that mentioned Nabulsi Sobhi and Taha were blocked as well as any content that mourned their death.

Meta also censored videos of Nabulsi's mother speaking to crowds and carrying her son's body during his funeral.

Meta Inc owns Facebook the world's largest social media website as well as the popular apps Instagram and WhatsApp.

According to Sada Social an initiative that records and monitors the suspension of Palestinian content and accounts on social media platforms the Meta campaign mainly targets journalists and activists based in the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem.

Its data showed that within 24 hours of Nabulsi's death at least 75 activist and journalist accounts were restricted or deleted on various social media platforms including Facebook Instagram TikTok and Twitter.

'Double standards'

Sada Social also claims that Meta has ""double standards' when it comes to content censorship.

""It launched an intensive campaign against Palestinian journalists by restricting [social media] posts reporting breaking news from Palestine but it did not restrict the Israeli forces' video showing them raiding Nablus and killing Palestinians"" Nidaa Bassoumi the media coordinator at Sada Social told Middle East Eye.

According to Bassoumi Meta has been restricting references to various figures and concepts associated with the Palestinian resistance as ""violating community standards"" including the Palestinian prisoners who escaped from Israel's Gilboa prison in 2021 and now Nabulsi.

Nablus: Senior resistance fighter killed in Israeli army raid Read More »

The practice is nothing new Bassoumi pointed out as an agreement has been in place since 2016 between the Israeli government and major social media platforms including Facebook to control Palestinian content.

Palestinian contents on social media is also closely monitored within Israel. As of April 2022 the Israeli cyber unit received complaints on 5815 social media posts by Palestinian users that had been accused of online incitement or support for ""terrorism"".

""Imagine Instagram deleted a journalist's Instagram account because she posted a photo of a Palestinian killed by Israeli forces"" Bassoumi said.

Silencing Palestinian voices

Palestinian journalist Aseel Sulieman's Instagram account was suspended after he posted three photos of Nabulsi and a video of Palestinians and Israeli special forces exchanging fire.

Sulaiman who has more than 51000 followers on the image-sharing app was accused of violating the ""Community Guidelines"" for posting photos of Nabulsi and his account was no longer visible to Instagram users.

Palestinian journalists and activists share screengrabs showing their social media posts being banned on Meta-owned platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.

""Israel has been punishing users who post Palestinian-related content by reducing and limiting their engagement and interaction"" Suliman told MEE.

Sulieman said that during the Israeli bombardment of Gaza last week in which at least 44 Palestinians were killed and more than 360 were wounded she noticed her Instagram account's engagement and reach had been restrained. However the suspension of her account came as a surprise.

""In other words they use the 'feel free to post about Palestine' tactic with some accounts but at the same time they also limit the reach of the content"" said the Roya TV news reporter.

""I thought I would grieve the loss of my 51K Instagram account to be honest but the death of three Palestinian heroes was my real loss. I can always start a new Instagram account but how will Palestine revive the souls of the three freedom fighters who were brutally killed by Israeli?""

'Digital massacre'

Under Meta's censorship Abdalafo Bassam's 436000 Instagram followers pose little value these days.

'I am one of the victims of the digital massacre by Meta... This is a digital Israeli aggression” - Abdalafo Bassam who has 436000 followers on Instagram

""I am one of the victims of the digital massacre by Meta"" Bassam one of the most prominent activists from Jerusalem during the Sheikh Jarrah and Gaza 2021 aggression told MEE.



""This is a digital Israeli aggression. While Palestinians on the ground are injured by bullets and shrapnel we are wounded online by restricting and silencing our voices"" he said.

Bassam joined Instagram and Facebook in 2010 and he highlighted how the algorithms have evolved over time to suppress Palestinian content.

Despite attempts to bypass censorship on Facebook by stripping out phrases such as ""Shahid Muqawameh” (martyr resistance) Bassam said he had previously been barred from posting stories pictures and videos on the website.

For months he had been barred from using Instagram Live the app's livestream feature.

A photo showing Nabulsi's mother smiling as she held her son's body at his funeral with the caption: ""A great mother holding [her son]"" was removed from his Instagram account.

""I did not mention Nabulsi I mentioned his mother was great so how did I violate Instagram's rules?"" he asked.

Instagram accused Bassam of using the platform to promote ""terrorism"".

During the first half of 2022 Sada Social Center documented around 425 digital violations against Palestinian content on social media.

Mind Force an Israeli PR firm now banned from Meta platforms had spent about $12000 on Facebook and Instagram ads and reportedly ran anti-Hamas political campaigns in the Gaza Strip.

Some of its accounts posed as freelance local journalists the vast majority of the profiles used pictures stolen from other sites and a few appeared to have been made with artificial intelligence.

These pages and accounts bought fake ""likes"" to make their content appear popular and followed.

The group was identified in the Facebook Quarterly Adversarial Threat Report released in August 2022 as part of a network ""originated in Israel and targeted Angola Nigeria and the Gaza region in Palestine"".

Facebook said it removed over 250 Facebook accounts and over 100 Instagram accounts for violating its policy against ""coordinated inauthentic behaviour"".",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL25ld3Mvc29jaWFsLW1lZGlhL21ldGEtdG8tdGVzdC1lbmQtdG8tZW5kLWVuY3J5cHRpb24tb24tbWVzc2VuZ2VyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meta to Test End-to-End Encryption on Messenger,"Meta will test new end-to-end encryption features on its Messenger app in the coming weeks the company said in a blog post Thursday. Some users of the app will have their messages encrypted end to end by default and have the ability to store encrypted backups of their messages.

The timing of the test is unrelated to a high-profile abortion case in Nebraska that became public this week a Meta spokesperson said via email. In that case the company complied with a search warrant and handed over to police the messages of a 17-year-old accused of having an illegal abortion.

End-to-end encryption of those messages and their storage would have prevented Meta from complying with the search warrant.

""As with end-to-end encrypted chats secure storage means that we won't have access to your messages unless you choose to report them to us"" Sara Su product management director for Messenger trust said in the blog post.

Meta has had Thursday's announcement planned for months the spokesperson said. The company previously announced steps toward default end-to-end encryption in August 2021 and January 2022. It also expanded encrypted messages on Instagram in February to all adults in Ukraine and Russia in response to Russia's invasion and war.

Secure storage tests will begin this week though only on Android and iOS devices. Other ways of accessing Messenger like on desktop aren't included in the test."

CARY N.C. (WTVD) -- MetLife announced that the company's Global Technology and Operations (GTO) organization is hiring in the Research Triangle Park area of North Carolina.

MetLife opened its technology campus in Cary in 2015 and has a network of more than 2600 employees. The company is hiring for 400 technology and customer service roles based in Cary by the end of 2022.

The roles they're hiring for will be a combination of some 100% virtual and some hybrid however all employees must reside in the Research Triangle area according to the company.

MetLife has 2600 employees in Cary and more than 2700 across North Carolina. Cary is the global technology hub.

""They made a tremendous investment in our town and brought several thousand employees"" Cary Chamber of Commerce president Mark Lawson said adding more than 3000 jobs were brought to Cary from existing companies expanding and new business recruitment.

""Xerox we brought them here three years ago"" Lawson said. ""Cary has really planned well. The infrastructure is second to none. Wonderful roads sidewalks storm water water sewer capabilities. Those are all things that developers think about and certainly corporations think about when they're looking to relocate or expand.""

Lawson said more industries that are looking at Cary include technology firms Clean Tech Fintech Life Science and Advanced Manufacturing and Health Care.

Governor Roy Cooper gave the following statement on Wednesday on MetLife's hiring:

""North Carolina is the best state for business and we know that companies can find the talented workforce they need to thrive. I'm excited to see MetLife continue their commitment to our state and look forward to seeing them grow and succeed here.""

Colton Lee 21 who was born in Cary is back in his hometown after living in Atlanta.

""There's definitely a lot of new opportunities popping up in the area and it's been kind of cool to see it grow"" Lee said.

Lee who's working in Cary as a church youth minister said he has a couple of friends in the tech industry that he's eager to see in North Carolina.

""I know that because of the job growth there's going to be even more of my friends even coming down from college and moving to this area"" Lee said.

Cary's growth comes as North Carolina is well positioned for the tech sector according to NC TECH.

""A highly educated workforce good pipeline of students and existing workers who are seeking additional training and skills"" president and CEO Brooks Raiford said. ""And migration of talent from around the country that want to come here.""

Raiford added those fundamentals don't go away quickly.

""One of the trends we see and the reporting that we do is that not only have we had a strong recent past we're positioned well for a strong near-term future so that's encouraging"" Raiford said.

For Lee despite the increasing growth he hopes it doesn't outpace itself.

""Where I grew up in Atlanta it kind of was in a similar phase but it blew up too fast so my hope is that it kind of maintains the charm that is has right now as it continues to grow"" Lee said.

""The excitement and passion we're seeing from our employees in Cary is undoubtedly a reflection of the innovative work we're doing here at MetLife as we live our company purpose by putting the customer at the center of everything we do"" Bill Pappas said who leads the GTO organization.

And it will do so by the end of 2022 if all goes according to plan. The emphasis is on tech skills.

Bill Pappas executive vice president and head of global technology and operations at MetLife tells WRAL TechWire:

“We are looking for critical skillsets on the technology side including software engineering data science cybersecurity and operational engineering as well as we’re looking to hire service operations associates to join our team.”

In a statement the company noted the hiring plans as a “doubling down on hiring” as a demonstration that MetLife remains committed to the Triangle and to the state of North Carolina where it employs more than 2700.

Some 2600 of those workers are based out of Cary’s Global Technology and Operations (GTO) campus in Cary a campus which also houses the first phase of Apple’s east coast hub in the Triangle.

The hiring plan isn’t tied to any economic development incentives nor will it take place over a period of a few years. Instead the company says it will be ramping up recruitment and hiring events including offering tech meetups hackathons expanding community partnerships and continuing its role with the Triangle Tech X conference later this year hosted by MetLife on November 30 and December 1.

400 new hires by Dec. 31

Pappas tells WRAL TechWire that the company could bring on board the 400 new workers by the end of this year in an interview.

“We’re going to be hiring 400 positions to fill both technology but also service operations needs that we have in Cary and we are going to be aiming to hire those by year-end” said Pappas.

Those positions will include those that will be in-person positions on-campus as well as some that will by hybrid positions and those that could be 100% remote a spokesperson for the company told WRAL TechWire this week. Still even the remote positions would be asked to be in the general Triangle area due to certain training needs and ongoing company operations from the Cary campus.

“We have a huge technology campus in Cary” said Pappas. “And a network of more than 2600 employees.”

MetLife seeking to add tech talent

This hiring plan is one that has been deliberate he noted in the interview adding that the company will expand how it traditionally recruits and attracts talented workers in order to fill roles.

In fact said Pappas the hiring programs are all a part of a new strategy that the company is employing currently and plans to continue to use moving forward.

That strategy is tied to how the company approaches its customers which Pappas called the organization’s “North Star.”

According to Pappas MetLife has seen increasing demand for technology products and services since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the company anticipates that demand will continue not just on digital platforms but also through more traditional means of communication including phone calls to associates who can assist customers across a variety of possible lines of inquiry.

Demand increasing

“We have seen the customers’ demand for digitization increase and we are responding to that” said Pappas. “Continue with what we’ve done through the pandemic in building those digital capabilities.”

Compare that to what Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said last week announcing that the company would cut 23% of its workforce just a few months after laying off 9% of its workers globally. Tenev said that the company made hiring decisions based on the “assumption that the heightened retail engagement we had been seeing with the stock and crypto markets in the COVID era would persist into 2022” in a blog post published on the Robinhood website.

But the company’s bet turned out to be wrong at least based on their latest move which included layoffs of 82 workers in Charlotte and shutting down a facility at which the company had once promised the state of North Carolina it would employ nearly 400 workers.

Still an uptick in customer demand was one of the items cited by Fidelity Investments which also maintains a large campus in the Triangle and announced it would step up existing hiring plans to add 1700 jobs in May of this year following earlier commitments to add 1500 and then an additional 500 workers. And a Fidelity executive told WRAL TechWire that it was the region’s strong talent base not the promise of economic incentives that led the decision for the company to expand its workforce in the region following the first hiring expansion announcement in May 2021.

MetLife focuses on Triangle

Even in a volatile labor market with tens of thousands of open jobs yet companies still announcing job cuts or expressing concerns about the current economic climate Pappas says that MetLife will always be active in the Triangle’s labor markets looking for the best talent.

“Our associates are our number one priority” said Pappas. “We will be consistently looking for that top talent and we want them to be a part of our team.”

And the company is expanding where it looks for talent. According to a statement the company released today the organization will host a variety of events in addition to ongoing recruitment efforts in the region.

The company’s careers webpage listed 143 available job openings as of Wednesday morning and WRAL TechWire tracks these openings as well as those at other employers across the region in the weekly WRAL TechWire Jobs Report. MetLife instituted a minimum wage for all positions of $20 per hour in August 2021 which a spokesperson noted this week would primarily affect the company’s customer service associate positions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NvYnNlcnZlci5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy9hcnRpY2xlMjY0MzA0Mzg2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MetLife to add 400 jobs to Cary NC campus this year,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.newsobserver.com', port=443): Read timed out.

The event featured service members from the U.S. Army Navy Marine Corps Air Force and Coast Guard all reaffirming their oaths of enlistment before kickoff.



The troops were guests of the NFL’s New York Jets football team as part of their “Salute to Service” pregame ceremony.



New York Army National Guard Soldiers led the New York Jets players out of their locker tunnel. Five other New York Soldiers joined other service members unfurling a large stadium flag on the field.



The ceremony had deep significance for Army National Guard Pvt. Joey Michel Molina who hails from a military family.



“My father is a master sergeant in the Army” Molina said. “I stand by my choice (to serve) my family supports me and I'm very proud to serve my country.”



Administering their oath of enlistment was New York Army National Guard Maj. Gen. Michel Natali the assistant adjutant general for New York.



“It's very important for us to show our new Soldiers that they have a legacy” Natali said. “The NFL has put some importance on this as well which signifies how important our Soldiers are in the community.”



During a game television commercial break Natali presented New York Army National Guard Spc. Chamiqua Loswijk a Minuteman Scholarship recognizing Loswijk’s academic excellence.



Loswijk assigned to Bravo Company of the 101st Expeditionary Signal Battalion said taking the field for the scholarship presentation with tens of thousands of fans was amazing.



“This is actually my first ever football game” Loswijk said.



“For it to be at this magnitude and have this level of importance is a very surreal experience. It's not a mundane thing or something to take for granted it's very exciting to say the least she said.



The Minuteman Scholarship of $35000 was presented to Loswijk for her academic excellence and her pursuit of a master’s degree in Psychology.



She is enrolled in the City University of New York Army ROTC program and will commission as a second lieutenant in the spring of 2024.

Loswijk said that her commitment to service has been from her community of friends family and fellow Soldiers who inspired her to join to serve and to continue her education and career.



“Those people in your life who encourage demand and hold you to a higher standard; those people who push you and inspire you if you listen to those people more often we would just be better off” she said.



The “Salute to Service” game saw the New York Jets defeat the Buffalo Bills 20-17 in an upset that Jets quarterback Zach Wilson credited as a “huge team win.""

(8/10/2022 5:15 p.m.)

If you’re sweating through the summer and wondering if there’s a climate change-based app to help know that DC funder Village Capital has the same question.

This fall Village Capital is partnering with MetLife Foundation to create a program for US-based founders focused on solving resiliency issues. Known as ADAPT: Social Innovation for a More Resilient Future in the United States the two-track program works with 20-24 startups pursuing solutions in climate change healthcare wellness and economic mobility. Startups will participate in programming from October through December with two companies in each of the two tracks being selected by their peers to receive a $50000 no-equity investment at the end of the process. This program accompanies additional programming in Argentina Brazil and Mexico.

The program will also feature “sprint weeks” — two virtual and one in-person — where founders participate in a virtual curriculum get to know their peers and hear from investors and industry professionals. An advisory board’s members will additionally serve as “super mentors” in the period between sessions.

Village Capital Manager Bryson Hearne explained that one of ADAPT’s two tracks “Community Resilience” will cover startups focused on disaster preparedness financial preparedness and economic opportunity. The other “Individual Resilience” is for startups creating products in health and wellness work and learning and financial health.

Hearne told Technical.ly that applicants can think of “resilience” from a disaster preparedness perspective be it flooding a disease outbreak or other similar crises. Village Capital is looking not just for companies that provide immediate solutions but also those that can help communities withstand these issues economically (i.e. insurance tech).

Hearne said Village Capital typically looks to invest in sustainability financial health future of work and healthcare. He’s interested in seeing the startups selected for ADAPT because the program intersects will all those issue areas.

“If I have a flood that hits my city that is both a disaster preparedness and there’s some sustainability tech there but it’s also a financial health challenge” Hearne said.

To apply startups need to be for-profit entities with operations or headquarters in the US. They also need at least one full-time founder in the US a minimum viable product and less than $1.5 million in equity raised. According to program rules Village Capital also wants some sort of meaningful connection or business validation; this could be qualified with revenue a successful pilot user numbers or strategic partnerships.

In particular Hearne said he’s excited to work with companies that are building technology for local governments and community organizing in the wake of natural disasters. Village Capital has previously worked with startups that built insurance tech for flooding and helped communities with medical debt. Hearne is additionally on the hunt for startups building resilience through mental health services and solutions.

“There’s a big opportunity for impact in helping local governments and regional governments respond to some of the challenges that they’re facing and I think technology can play a role there” Hearne said.

It was determined that modifications in the printing environments may allow for adjusting a component’s stiffness to weight ratio.

Study: Mastering the density of 3D printed thermoplastic elastomer foam structures with controlled temperature. Image Credit: HannaTor/Shutterstock.com

Background

Research on the variable microscopic structures of multi-scale materials has inspired progress in manufacturing materials and processes for their synthetic production. Polymers have been readily implemented in the manufacture of multi-scale structures owing to their strength-to-weight ratio ease of processing and market availability. Many polymer foams are generally manufactured by extrusion and batch foaming.

The manufacture of complex cellular structures is challenging using traditional manufacturing methods. However advancements in additive manufacturing technologies have allowed their production while controlling the distribution of porosity. Due to the availability and simplicity of various thermoplastic filaments fused filament fabrication (FFF) or fused deposition modeling (FDM) is a widely employed additive manufacturing method.

These filaments commonly consisting of polymers like polycarbonate (PC) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) are often used for 3D-printed structures using a 3D volume slicing software to deposit layers via an extruder nozzle.

The present paper analyzed the impact of the temperature of the nozzle on the filament thickness and the reduction in density. Further the density reduction was predicted in relation to the temperature using a Gompertz function. Finally the nozzle temperature’s effect on the specific modulus was assessed.

About the Study

In this study researchers used Nanovia Flex EXP (NFE) foamable filaments compounded with unexpanded thermally expanded microspheres (TEM). The elastomeric samples were 3D-printed with a RepRap DIY Prussa i3 3D printer. A nozzle diameter of 0.8 mm and 0.6 mm was used to print the samples. Furthermore the compounded TEMs’ melting and glass transition temperatures and the phase change enthalpies were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) while the sample density was measured using a Mettler Toledo XS205DU balance.

A Mettler Toledo FP82HT hot stage system was used to determine the maximum expansion temperature average diameter and initial expansion temperature of the TEMs. Moreover the TEM geometries and morphologies within the NFE filaments were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs. On the other hand the TEMs’ expansion curve was obtained experimentally.

Observations

It was observed that the expansion of the NFE-compounded TEM achieved micro-structural density reduction. It was noted that the sample density would be reduced with an increase in the number of microspheres. During 3D printing the NFE filament was capable of reducing the sample density with an increase in the nozzle temperature.

Furthermore in addition to increased layer height and nozzle diameter for thicker prints the volumetric flow rate of the foamable filaments was further increased due to the expansion of the TEM inside the 3D printer’s heating chamber. However with a reduced mass flow rate the NFE filament would spend more time in the 3D printer’s heating chamber and thus melt along the printer’s extruder and clog the system. Increasing the layer height or the speed of printing could avoid this failure.

Additionally the SEM cross-section micrographs of the samples exhibited an increase in cell density. It was also observed that the cell distribution remained homogeneous across the samples even though the increased temperature led to an increase in cell density. A reduction in the voids between the deposited sample layers was due to TEM expansion as a result of increased nozzle temperature. Moreover the team found that the density was affected by the TEM volume fraction and decreased with the temperature increase due to TEM expansion.

Although a linear curve was obtained depicting density reduction in line with rising TEM volume fraction the foamed samples and the unexpanded filaments printed at 240 °C showed a nonlinear behavior at a 200-250 °C nozzle temperature. To account for this the Gompertz function was used to assess the density reduction with respect to temperature. In addition it was also observed that the rise in nozzle temperature decreased the samples’ tensile strength caused due to the increased microporosites inside the samples as a result of the TEM expansion.

Conclusions

To summarize the team studied the physical characterization and the capability of foamable filaments to produce microscopic-level closed-cell morphologies using the FFF process. According to the authors the manipulation of the 3D printing parameters gives a novel approach to the FFF 3D printing process which allows in situ foaming along with specimen fabrication with foam gradients providing a potential application of foamable filaments in the production of gradient structures.

In her second Nevada appearance since June Harris landed at Harry Reid International Airport in Air Force Two and went straight to the MGM Grand for the United Steelworkers Union convention.

Addressing the roughly 2000 union delegates Harris praised the union for “the work that you do every day to keep our nation running and to move our nation forward.”

Harris' speech was met with a standing ovation three separate times. Her remark “When unions are strong America is strong” was the first followed by comments on protecting pensions and when discussing the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act making corporations pay their “fair share” in taxes.



Her union speech was followed by a roundtable with Nevada state legislators to discuss abortion protections. Despite it being settled law in the Silver State since 1990 Harris has been meeting with legislators in states across the country since Roe was overturned by the conservative Supreme Court.

Attendees at the roundtable included Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro and Assemblywoman Selena Torres amongst others.

“This is yes about the women of Nevada but it's about the women of America” Vice President Harris said in the roundtable. “And in that way I want to thank the Nevada legislature for what you've been doing. You all have been fighting on the frontlines to protect women.”

Senate Majority Leader Cannizzaro said the Democrat-controlled legislature would work to expand abortion protections in the state of Nevada during the 2023 legislative session.



The vice president then met with Culinary Union leaders before heading to the pastry kitchen of the MGM Grand where culinary union member pastry chefs create all desserts served in the sprawling Las Vegas casino resort.

Harris brought up questions about the various desserts on display while sampling some of them much to her delight. The final unannounced segment of her Las Vegas trip served as a way for the vice president to personally connect with the union members she had spent the day publicly supporting.

Harris then left the MGM back to Harry Reid to depart for the Bay Area after a six-hour trip to the Southern Nevada county that could very well decide the control of the Senate in the November midterm elections.

Notably absent from the visit were most of Nevada’s congressional Democrat politicians including embattled U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto Reps. Dina Titus and Susie Lee and Gov. Steve Sisolak.

Congressman Steven Horsford was the only Nevada congressional politician in attendance greeting Vice President Harris on the tarmac and spending most of the day with her.

Many Republican statements sent in advance of Vice President Harris’ visit touched upon the trip as a campaign stop for many of the candidates.

In a lengthy 287-word statement GOP Senate candidate Adam Laxalt said in part:

“To reward Cortez-Masto for her deciding vote on the massive tax-and-spend inflation expanding legislation Kamala Harris left D.C. this week to campaign for Masto in Las Vegas at a private event funded by lobbyists and interest groups who seek to profit from the Democrats’ complete control of the federal government.”

Joe Lombardo’s campaign similarly wrote ""It's only August but Steve Sisolak is already bringing out his friend Kamala Harris to help his struggling campaign.”

However Harris’ team confirmed this was never intended as a campaign stop but rather a way to connect with union supporters and promote the recent passage of bills such as CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act.

Nonetheless many Nevada Democrats face a tough reelection campaign but lead some to suggest Democrats nationwide may be distancing themselves from the administration.

In response to why they were absent the offices of Reps. Dina Titus and Susie Lee simply said they had “a prior scheduling conflict” or “prior engagements.”

In regards to Sisolak his campaign offered a little more detail.

“Governor Sisolak appreciates the Vice President’s work highlighting Nevada’s men and women of labor and the need to protect reproductive freedom in the Silver State” said Reeves Oyster with the governor’s campaign. “Due to prior commitments Chief of Staff Yvanna Cancela represented the Sisolak administration today.”

In fact some people are convinced Atlanta — center of the nation’s hip-hop music scene — will lose more music festivals and performances on public land as organizers and artists learn that state law makes it nearly impossible for them to stop people from carrying guns among the alcohol-fueled crowds.

That prospect has ignited a new fight over gun rights in Georgia that is roiling the governor’s race casting a shadow over Atlanta’s vaunted music scene and adding to tension between the city and state.

Live Nation has refused to say why it recently called off September’s Music Midtown a longtime fixture for pop music lovers.

But news outlets citing anonymous sources ascribed last week’s announcement to a 2019 Georgia Supreme Court decision that outlined limits on the ability of private companies to ban guns on public property. The ruling stemmed from a 2014 state law that expanded the locations where guns were allowed.

Democrats led by Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams pounced on the news casting the cancellation as an example of the sort of economic fallout the state would experience from Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s “extreme gun agenda.” Though the gun law cited in reports about Music Midtown was enacted under Kemp’s Republican predecessor Kemp was a key backer of a new state law this year that eliminated the need for a license — and with it a background check — to carry a handgun in public.

An Atlanta Journal-Constitution editorial warned the gun policies threaten Atlanta’s status as the “cultural capital of the South.” Atlanta City Council President Doug Shipman bemoaned the loss of this year’s Music Midtown as well as its timing.

“All of these things are culminating at the moment when we should be coming out of COVID with music festivals and people gathering a lot of economic activity” he told The Associated Press.

Beyond the immediate fallout the fight also added to a disconnect between Georgia’s heavily Democratic capital city and the GOP-controlled state Legislature that has recently expanded gun rights and restricted abortion and voting access. State leaders butted heads with huge Atlanta-based firms Delta Air Lines and Coca-Cola over the voting changes which the companies called “unacceptable.”

Live Nation did not respond to emails about the cancellation of Music Midtown. The festival’s website cited “circumstances beyond our control” but no one from the company has publicly blamed the state’s gun laws.

Phillip Evans a gun rights activist who’d previously sued the Atlanta Botanical Garden over its gun-free policy has said he had warned Music Midtown organizers that their policy of banning guns was contrary to state law. Evans’ suit prompted the 2019 state Supreme Court ruling that said private companies with a certain type of lease on public land could not ban guns.

Live Nation planned to host the festival at Piedmont Park — public land — where the festival had been held each year since 2011 with the coronavirus-related exception of 2020. And it almost certainly fell into the leasing category that would make a ban on guns illegal.

“In terms of Music Midtown it’s virtually a no-brainer that they can’t ban guns there” said John Monroe an attorney who represented a gun rights group in the case before the state Supreme Court.

Cancelling the event over the gun law would make sense from Live Nation’s perspective said Timothy Lytton a law professor at Georgia State University.

A mass shooting at a country music festival in Las Vegas in 2017 that claimed more than 50 lives cost MGM Resorts International — the owner of the concert venue — and its insurers $800 million in legal claims. With no restriction on guns Live Nation was looking at potentially “astronomical” liability exposure at Music Midtown Lytton said.

The cancellation was a blow to Georgia’s economy and local businesses.

Abrams said in a statement that Kemp “cares more about protecting dangerous people carrying guns in public than saving jobs and keeping business in Georgia” and her campaign released an attack ad this week focused on the cancellation. Democrats in other states also weighed in.

Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak tweeted “Here in Nevada we believe in common sense gun safety and protecting our reproductive rights. @MusicMidtown we would love to have you in the Silver state!” North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper also invited Music Midtown to his state.

Kemp accused Abrams and other Democrats of “pushing” critical narratives of Georgia’s firearms landscape to distract from inflation that he blames on the party’s policies.

Georgia also recently took fire from Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom over a state law banning most abortions once fetal cardiac activity is present. The law took effect last month.

Newsom released an ad in the entertainment magazine “Variety” last week urging film companies to end production in states including Georgia that he accused of a “cruel assault on essential rights.” State tax credits have made Georgia a major destination for film production.

Kemp told reporters last week that he wasn’t worried about attempts by Democratic governors including in California to lure business away from Georgia.

“You check the gas prices in those states lately?” Kemp said citing strong industrial development tourism and film figures in Georgia.

Gun rights advocates have identified at least one other music venue in Atlanta that they say could be in violation of the 2014 gun law — Chastain Park which features an amphitheater nestled inside a wealthy residential neighborhood and prohibits “weapons” at shows.

But the activists say they are not looking to shut down events just protect themselves.

“If I’m going somewhere in a big crowd I want to be able to carry my firearm” said Jerry Henry executive director of Georgia Second Amendment. “I will assure you there will be criminals out there.”

The $280 billion Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) Act was signed by President Biden on Tuesday. The legislation enjoyed bipartisan support.

One of the companies that will benefit from the legislation is Microchip Technologies which employs around 500 people at its Colorado Springs plant.

Matthew Bunker Vice President of Operations at Microchip told reporters Thursday that his company expects to at least double its workforce locally in the coming months and years.

Microchip produces roughly 50 to 60 semiconductors that are used routinely in the automotive industry.

""The windshield wipers the door controllers the engine controllers anti-lock brakes; all of that requires intelligence"" Bunker said.

The company also produces a variety of microprocessors and microcontrollers that are used in support of 5G telecommunications networks.

The company experienced a surge in demand in the wake of the global microchip shortage. Bunker said they were already planning to expand when the CHIPS Act passed.

""What the CHIPS Act does is it really levels the playing field of US companies with other competitors around the world"" he said.

The legislation creates a tax credit for American manufacturers who invest in growing their operations in the US. It also makes federal grants available for research and development.

""We're gonna give our semiconductor industry a real shot in the arm here"" said Senator Michael Bennet (D) Colorado. ""I'm excited about what it means for Americans and for workers in Colorado the chance to earn a decent living.""

Bennet toured the facility with company executives on Thursday and told reporters that pandemic supply chain disruption really exposed national security risks. He said the overwhelming majority of the microchips used in our modern military equipment are made overseas.

""Ninety-five percent of the most significant chips in our fighter planes are manufactured in Taiwan and I think there is a bi-partisan consensus that that is not good for our national security which is why we passed the CHIPS Act"" Bennet said.

Bunker said that Microchip works with local colleges and universities to develop a talent pipeline to support its local operations. Many of the jobs don't require a college degree.

""Those students that are thinking about going to college and are thinking about their careers make sure that they understand manufacturing jobs are a very good career and it's not like the manufacturing from 20 years ago"" Bunker said.

Senator Bennet noticed a big shift in thinking in Washington DC recently when it comes to the global economy and companies exporting manufacturing jobs overseas.

Bennet believes the CHIP Act is a strong first step in re-establishing American manufacturing in critical industries.

""I think this is really the first step of something that I hope over the next decades we commit to which is making sure that we’ve got a capitalist economy in this country that can actually sustain working families and make sure they can afford to live here"" Bennet said.

Marco Rubio defended his vote in a room full of semiconductor corporate executives.

After touring the SkyWater chip plant in Kissimmee and hearing several executives at a roundtable he empaneled herald the recent passage of the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 Rubio laid out his objections to the bill which he said overcame his support for the bill’s intention investing in American technology innovation to compete with China.

But there was that objection and Rubio explained himself in depth to the tech company executives gathered at the SkyWater offices in Osceola County’s NeoCity tech business park just outside of Kissimmee: Rubio contended microchip makers got the bill’s security provisions watered down so much there would be little or no defense against China’s intellectual property theft of American innovations.

“I think they were very strongly supportive of what I am very strongly supportive of which is government investment in this field” Rubio said later at a news conference. “What I can’t support … the law the way it was written was watered down by some of the big chip companies for purposes of benefiting their business model.”

The issue of support for or opposition to the CHIPS Act approved in a bipartisan fashion in Congress and signed Tuesday by President Joe Biden is already emerging as a 2022 U.S. Senate election campaign wedge between Rubio and his likely November opponent Democratic U.S. Rep. Val Demings of Orlando.

The CHIPS bill actually was rolled into another for Supreme Court funding H.R. 4346. Rubio was one of 33 Republicans to vote “no” in the Senate in late July while 17 Republicans voted “yes.” Florida’s U.S. Sen. Rick Scott also voted “no.”

Rubio has long promoted two ideas regarding semiconductor research and manufacturing and he said they came into conflict with the final version of the CHIPS Act.

Despite his desire to be seen as a free-market capitalist he told the gathering at NeoCity he believes there are times when the government needs to override market outcomes and investing in American microchip technology innovation and manufacturing is a key example.

Yet he also believes China’s dominance in the microchip manufacturing center combined with the government’s virtually open promotion of theft of intellectual properties like semiconductor design must be addressed first before America invests heavily in American research he believes will ultimately be stolen by China.

“If we’re going to invest billions of dollars of your money taxpayer money in developing semiconductors we should at least have additional security requirements because they’re already stealing our innovations now” Rubio told reporters afterwards.

The roundtable discussion began with semiconductor business executive hosts including SkyWater CEO Thomas Sonderman praising the CHIPS Act.

Rubio wasted no time offering his assessment in response. Yes America needs to be investing in American technology research even if that means bending the free market rules.

Yet Rubio told the roundtable the risk of China stealing America’s technology innovations is currently too great to invest right now. He argued lax rules are in place about when and how American companies can have chips actually manufactured in China where the government and government-owned tech manufacturing companies are conspiring to reengineer and steal the technology.

“The greatest threat to intellectual properties in human history has happened in just the last decade. Hundreds of billions of dollars of research often funded by the American taxpayer turned over” Rubio said.

Demings who strongly supported the CHIPS Act also acknowledged security concerns. Last week she called on Congress to pass the National Critical Capabilities Defense Act as a necessary provision to ensure American manufacturing competes with China.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHA6Ly9uZXdzLmdhdGVjaC5lZHUvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA4LzExL25ldy1jaGlwLWNvdWxkLW1ha2UtdHJlYXRpbmctbWV0YXN0YXRpYy1jYW5jZXItZWFzaWVyLWFuZC1mYXN0ZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Chip Could Make Treating Metastatic Cancer Easier and Faster | News Center,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', ConnectionResetError(10054, 'An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host', None, 10054, None)) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHA6Ly9uZXdzLmdhdGVjaC5lZHUvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA4LzExL25ldy1jaGlwLWNvdWxkLW1ha2UtdHJlYXRpbmctbWV0YXN0YXRpYy1jYW5jZXItZWFzaWVyLWFuZC1mYXN0ZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3RlY2gvY29tcHV0aW5nL2dsb2JhbC1jaGlwLXNob3J0YWdlLWdpdmVzLXVzLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmctYS1ib29zdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Global Chip Shortage and $53B Subsidy Boosts US Manufacturing,"When you can't buy that Sony PS5 or Ford F-150 pickup blame the chip shortage. A worldwide problem triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic has metastasized into a years-long disruption of everything electronic and is prompting governments to spend lavishly on chipmaking subsidies.

The shortage is leading the tech industry and politicians to try to reverse the United States' waning importance in the microprocessor business. President Joe Biden in August signed into law the CHIPS and Science Act which provides US semiconductor makers with $52.7 billion over five years to ramp up processor manufacturing.

Robert Rodriguez/CNET

The chip shortage has shone a new spotlight on the state of US manufacturing and how much of it has moved out of the country. The US government isn't happy with how reliant the country's economy and military have become on Asian high-tech manufacturing and China is spending big on its own chipmaking abilities.

Intel which has slipped to third place behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and Samsung Foundry hopes rising demand and the CHIPS Act subsidies will help it reclaim its leadership position. It's also launched an ambitious plan to make processors for other companies not just itself in what's called a chip foundry business.

""We don't want to create a situation where the United States which created the semiconductor industry and Silicon Valley would be completely dependent on other nations for that product"" said Al Thompson who leads Intel's US government relations.

In January Intel said it'll spend $20 billion on two chip fabrication plants or fabs near Columbus Ohio. The new ""megafab"" site eventually could house eight Intel fabs costing $100 billion in total.

The idea of ""technological sovereignty"" is loosening government purse strings. Worries about falling behind China in yet another area of manufacturing helped build support for the CHIPS Act. Similar worries have advanced the European Union's Chips for Europe initiative with 15 billion euros ($17.1 billion) in new funding.

The chip industry's new course is part of what some call the decoupling which at least to some degree is pulling the Chinese and US economies apart. No one expects supply chains without links overseas but the chip shortage response definitely has a nationalist flavor.

Asian manufacturers aren't standing idle as Intel invests in capacity increases. In January while reporting record revenue for the fourth quarter of 2021 TSMC said it will invest between $40 billion and $44 billion in new chipmaking plants and equipment in 2022 — an enormous amount.

""Foundry capacity will be precious for the foreseeable future as demand for semiconductors only grows"" said Creative Strategies analyst Ben Bajarin.

Here's what's going on and what's at stake.

What started the chip shortage?

In short the COVID-19 pandemic and a lot of shock waves that traversed the world's economy. Demand for work-from-home technology like PCs tablets and webcams soared beyond the semiconductor manufacturing industry's ability to supply chips — not just the big CPU brains of a laptop but also the host of supporting chips required to produce things like dishwashers baby monitors and LED light fixtures.

The chip shortage soon extended beyond remote work and school needs to home entertainment products like tablets game consoles TVs and graphics cards for gaming PCs all of which people stuck at home were buying in record numbers. Compounding the problem: a fire at Japanese chipmaker Renesas Electronics and crippling winter weather in Texas that knocked more than 70 power plants offline and cut juice to a Samsung chip plant.

COVID lockdowns led automakers to put chip orders on hold. Those companies rely disproportionately on cheaper processors that don't require cutting-edge chipmaking technology. By the time they realized demand was picking up chip plants had allocated their capacity to other customers.

And that wasn't all. A glut of shipping and dearth of shipping containers has snarled delivery of not just finished goods but also their components and raw materials. Cars and computers require hundreds of electronic components but just one missing component means a product can't be sold. For an advanced processor there's likely only one company building it.

How long will the chip shortage last?

It probably won't get any worse but it'll likely last for several more months. Chipmakers have worked to squeeze as much new capacity as they can out of their fabrication facilities or ""fabs"" but it takes years to build new fabs and ramp up production.

Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told CNET that he thinks we're almost through the worst of the chip shortage which will last through the second half of 2021. He predicts it'll gradually ease through 2022 and fade in 2023.

Mismatches in chip supply and demand have been common for decades but not like this. ""We've always gone through cycles. This time it's different"" AMD CEO Lisa Su said in September at the Code conference. She too expects this chip shortage will ease in 2022. But IBM CEO Arvind Krishna thinks it's more likely the chip shortage will last through 2023 and even 2024.

What's being affected by the chip shortage?

It's easier to say what isn't being affected. Just about anything with a power cord these days uses chips so the shortage has hit cameras microwave ovens TVs pacemakers washing machines and more.

Worst hit is the auto industry. Cars are now studded with computer chips that control everything from infotainment systems to antilock brakes and the car-making industry has relied heavily on ""just-in-time"" purchasing that cuts costs but means there's no big inventory of parts to buffer against shortages. The situation has gutted their revenue by an estimated $210 billion in 2021 according to a study by AlixPartners and auto manufacturing could suffer through 2023.

The shortage forced carmakers to halt production including Ford Motor General Motors Toyota Nissan Subaru and Stellantis (formerly Fiat Chrysler). Some carmakers have shipped autos without accessories that need chips leaving customers without touchscreens in their new cars. Tesla got credit for weathering the storm better than most but it's still suffering from chip constraints.

Gaming consoles also have been hit hard. The chip shortage meant fitful availability and poachers jacking up prices for the Sony PS5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X. The Nintendo Switch and Valve's Steam Deck arrived late too.

Even Apple has suffered despite being led by supply chain guru Tim Cook and having the clout to place massive orders years in advance. The iPhone 12 launch was weeks late and chip shortages continued to hit Apple through 2021.

To cope with the problem PC maker Framework has had to make ""risk buys"" by purchasing extra inventory of components well ahead of time said CEO Nirav Patel though it's weathered the storm so far. ""It's definitely a long-term extended challenge for everyone"" he said.

To secure capacity for future products ""fabless"" chip designers like Nvidia AMD and Qualcomm pay billions of dollars to chip manufacturers. Intel expects such prepayments as well through its new foundry business. Smartphone chip designer Qualcomm expects sufficient capacity midway through 2022 thanks to such capacity planning. ""Our supply has increased significantly"" CEO Cristiano Amon told The Verge in a January interview. ""The chip shortage is not over yet but things are getting much better as we go to the first half of 2022.""

What are chipmakers doing to ramp up manufacturing?

Semiconductor manufacturers are working harder to squeeze every last wafer through their fabs. But there's not much they can do about the immediate shortage.

It takes years to build a fab. Intel just started building two new facilities Fab 52 and 62 in Arizona at a cost of $20 billion. But they won't begin mass manufacturing until the second half of 2024 said Keyvan Esfarjani leader of Intel's manufacturing and supply chain.

But today's shortage is accelerating tomorrow's investment. Chipmakers like Samsung GlobalFoundries Intel and TSMC see demand for semiconductors surging as digital technology spreads far beyond computers and smartphones.

""We see the digitization of everything"" Gelsinger said.

Gelsinger has urged automakers to shift their processors to newer manufacturing technology that thanks to miniaturization can squeeze more chips out of a single 300mm-wide silicon wafer. That's not an easy change though given that much of the auto industry selects and validates components that are used for years. It could help Intel's effort to become a foundry that builds others' chips though not just its own products.

OK how expensive is this investment?

Hoo boy. Chipmakers' coming capital investments are extraordinary. Intel trumpeted $23.5 billion in spending this year in the US followed by plans for two ""megafabs"" in coming years totaling $200 billion. ""These are big sites — something like over 1000 acres"" each with room to fit eight fabs Esfarjani said.

TSMC's investments include a new fab in Arizona and a new fab partnership in Japan with Sony. Samsung expects to spend $145 billion through 2030.

""Five years ago people said we were boring"" Su said. ""The world has really realized this is now an essential part of what people do.""

In November Samsung announced that one of its investments is a $17 billion fab in Taylor Texas.

The shortage also gave new power to lesser-known chipmakers still building chips with earlier-generation ""legacy node"" manufacturing technology. That includes ST Microelectronics Onsemi Microchip NXP Semiconductors and Infineon. GlobalFoundries the manufacturing division AMD spun off in 2018 held its initial public offering despite a lack of profitability and bowing out of the race to keep up with the three leading-edge chipmakers: Intel Samsung and TSMC.

GlobalFoundries is investing $1 billion to increase its current fab capacity in New York and add another fab there. It's also building a fab in Singapore and expanding one in Germany.

Companies that build semiconductor manufacturing tools are raking in the money. Globally spending on chip equipment will rise 10% in 2022 to a record high of $98 billion the third year of growth in a row the trade group Semi said in January. South Korea is the biggest spender followed by Taiwan and China collectively accounting for an expected 73% of spending this year. Korean spending should increase 14% in 2022 but spending in the US and China likely will decrease the group said.

ASML the Dutch company that's the premier maker of the lithography equipment critical to shrinking chip electronics has seen orders surge. It's already received its first order for a next-gen machine — likely from Intel which said it's first in line. The truck-sized equipment inscribes circuitry with extremely short wavelength extreme ultraviolet or EUV light and focuses it more precisely with high numeric aperture (high NA) optics. Those devices will cost chipmakers an average of $340 million each.

What are the political repercussions?

US politicians attuned to economic ebbs and flows don't like it when consumers can't consume. The Biden administration has been trying to respond federally to the supply chain problems. It prodded companies to be more transparent about their needs and supplies called on Congress to create the Critical Supply Chain Resiliency Program and started working to foster more US independence from international suppliers.

And there's been more than a little freaking out that the US military is so reliant on overseas companies. As a 250-page White House report put it in June: ""Semiconductors ... are fundamental to the operation of virtually every military system including communications and navigations systems and complex weapons systems such as those found in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. They are key to the 'must-win' technologies of the future including artificial intelligence and 5G which will be essential to achieving the goal of a 'dynamic inclusive and innovative national economy' identified as a critical American advantage in the March 2021 Interim National Security Strategic Guidance. In addition the development of advanced autonomous systems cybersecurity space and hypersonics and directed energy is also dependent on semiconductor technologies.""

The push also dovetails with the Biden administration's Made in America effort to increase government spending on US-made products and boost US manufacturing more broadly.

The term that encapsulates the desired outcome? Supply chain resiliency. That means flagging problems sooner making the government and private sector more adaptable and building supply buffers of inventory that cushion supply chain shocks. Overall that would reduce the likelihood and severity of supply chain surprises.

""The industry is begging for derisking"" said Capgemini analyst Darshan Naik.

What does that mean for chipmakers specifically?

In short money. The CHIPS Act's $52.7 billion in funding will mean a $3 billion discount on a modern fab that otherwise costs $10 billion. That 30% discount is comparable to what chipmakers in South Korea and Taiwan get Gelsinger said.

Tech companies pushed hard for the law. In a Dec. 1 letter the CEOs of Apple Google parent Alphabet Verizon Dell HP Toyota America Ford GM Stellantis and IBM joined chip leaders from Intel AMD TSMC Samsung GlobalFoundries and others to urge Congress to pass funding for the CHIPS Act.

""Semiconductors are essential to virtually all sectors of the economy — including aerospace automobiles communications clean energy information technology and medical devices"" the execs said. ""Demand for these critical components has outstripped supply creating a global chip shortage and resulting in lost growth and jobs in the economy. The shortage has exposed vulnerabilities in the semiconductor supply chain and highlighted the need for increased domestic manufacturing capacity.""

Intel will build its Ohio megafab regardless of government funding but the funding will make the project bigger and accelerate Intel's expansion Esfarjani said. The company plans to settle on its European megafab site in coming months he added.

Gelsinger has argued that only companies headquartered in the United States — which is to say Intel and not Samsung or TSMC — should benefit from US subsidies. ""Foreign chipmakers vying for US subsidies will keep their valuable intellectual property on their own shores ensuring that the most lucrative and cutting-edge manufacturing stays there"" Gelsinger said in a June op-ed.

But even fabs owned by overseas companies can help anchor electronics manufacturing in the US develop trained workers and generate economic activity and taxes. ""In addition to our partners in Texas we are grateful to the Biden Administration for creating an environment that supports companies like Samsung as we work to expand leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing in the US"" said Kinam Kim the CEO of Samsung Electronics Device Solutions Division in a statement.

Is this happening just in the US?

Nope. The European Union also wants a bigger piece of the processor production pie.

Its push for technological sovereignty led the European Union to propose an 11 billion euro European Chips act that could be pooled with 4 billion euros in other spending and 30 billion in earlier commitments to help chip manufacturing in Europe. The goal is to increase Europe's share of chip manufacturing from 9% today to 20%.

""The pandemic has also painfully exposed the vulnerability of chips supply chains. ... We have seen that whole production lines came to a standstill for example with cars"" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in February. The European Chips Act's goals are to increase resilience that will insulate European manufacturing from supply chain disruptions and to ""to make Europe an industrial leader in this very strategic market.""

Here too Intel is a fan. It plans to build another $100 billion megafab in Europe.

Can you really move the whole electronics industry to the US?

No way. The electronics industry is vastly larger than just making chips including upstream supplies like wafers and manufacturing equipment and downstream activities like packaging testing and assembly most of it in Asia. ""There's a lot of other aspects of the supply chain and I believe those need to be more balanced as well"" Gelsinger said.

Here's where $52 billion starts looking like a small expenditure. The Boston Consulting Group expects it would take $900 billion to $1.23 trillion in spending to create self-sufficient semiconductor supply chains worldwide. For just the US it's $350 billion to $420 billion. And that cost runs contrary to the capitalistic impulse to reward the least expensive suppliers.

""It'll definitely create supply chain inefficiencies"" BCG analyst Matt Langione said. ""Costs will go up. But there should be more redundancy in the system.""

Nearshoring which would move manufacturing operations nearer to the US but not all the way is another possibility particularly for assembly testing and other work not quite as high-tech as the chipmaking itself. ""Mexico could be a strong option"" CapGemini's Naik said.

Different regions develop specialties in semiconductor manufacturing around the world and reproducing that expertise locally would cost $900 billion to $1.2 trillion says a Boston Consulting Group study. Boston Consulting Group

TSMC founder and former CEO Morris Chang is skeptical. ""It's not going to be possible to turn back the clock"" Chang said in October. ""If you want to reestablish a complete semiconductor supply chain in the United States you will not find it to be a possible task.""

Chip players naturally clump into ""highly concentrated clusters"" consulting firm Deloitte said in a December report. Spreading that work geographically will help supply chain woes but it's not easy. ""Clusters create strong pools of talent and skills. Prior attempts to build more geographically distributed manufacturing capacity (such as Silicon Glen in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s) came to naught"" Deloitte concluded.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology believes investments need to happen at the research level not just with chipmakers. ""The hollowing out of semiconductor manufacturing in the US is compromising our ability to innovate in this space and puts at risk our command of the next technological revolution. To ensure long-term leadership leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing in the US must be prioritized and universities activities have to get closer to it"" MIT said in a January report. It called for upgrades from 1990s-era technology that tiles chips onto silicon wafers 150mm in diameter to equipment with 200mm wafers that are newer if not cutting edge.

Who loses from splitting electronics supply chains?

Rebalancing global supply chains doesn't sound so great for companies that don't benefit like Chinese phone and network equipment maker Huawei a giant with $71 billion in revenue for the first three quarters of 2021. The Trump administration believed its network equipment posed a national security threat and the Biden administration agrees so sales of Huawei products continue to be blocked. Raising barriers against overseas companies and promoting US ones could lead China or others to take the same stance against US companies said Andy Purdy chief security officer of Huawei USA.

""There are some major unintended consequences [of trade barriers] that are really going to hurt the US in the long term"" Purdy said. ""If the American semiconductor industry is not allowed to sell to Huawei or Chinese companies that's going to undo a lot of the good things the Biden administration is trying to do.""

Indeed Huawei has switched away from some US-made chips.

But even Andrew Feldman CEO of AI chip and computer maker Cerebras thinks there's a risk of relying too much on Samsung and TSMC — his company's chip manufacturer.

""What a bad idea it is for so much of the American economy to rely on a fab you can swim to from China or that you can throw a stone to from the DMZ in Korea"" Feldman said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzExL2FyYWJpX3F1YWxjb21tX2luZGljdG1lbnQv0gFFaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tL0FNUC8yMDIyLzA4LzExL2FyYWJpX3F1YWxjb21tX2luZGljdG1lbnQv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Four charged with tricking Qualcomm into buying $150m startup,"Updated The US Department of Justice has charged four people with conspiring to fraudulently sell a startup for $150 million to a San Diego based multinational tech company that The Reg has identified as Qualcomm.

The DoJ claims this was despite the fledgling company's supposedly proprietary tech having been developed by Qualcomm staff and allegedly aided by inside access to Qualcomm.

The indictment claims that Qualcomm's now ex-vice president of research and development Karim Arabi created new microchip technology unbeknownst to his then main employer in 2015. Meanwhile it goes on to allege another former Qualcomm vice president Akbar Shokouhi helped fund and support the development of a resultant business Abreezio LLC via three different entities he controlled.

Under Arabi's contract the indictment says ""he was bound by agreements generally providing that intellectual property he created during his period of employment would belong to"" his employer Qualcomm.

The intellectual property Abreezio is said to have developed includes ""IP and EDA tools focused on PPA optimization in advanced technology nodes"" according to the Linkedin bio of a company exec.

The indictment alleges that some Qualcomm VPs along with Abreezio's appointed CEO Sanjiv Taneja obscured Arabi's role in developing the tech due to provisions in his contract that stated inventions made during employment belonged to Qualcomm.

Instead the group marketed the invention as being the brainchild of a Canadian graduate student Sheida Alan and the company as an angel-funded Silicon Valley-based design IP startup.

The Canadian-grad-student-Angel-investor narrative was marketed to Qualcomm to entice them to purchase Abreezio the DoJ claims.

But according to the indictment unsealed on 9 August Alan was Arabi's ""younger sister.""

Court documents allege Arabi was the one who filed the provisional patents under Alan's name and was secretly involved in most Abreezio matters even choosing the company name.

The crew sought to hide his involvement using sham email accounts and even having Arabi impersonate his sister the indictment alleges.

Meanwhile the company relied on Arabi to provide intel on Qualcomm allege prosecutors. Court documents allege Teneja asked Arabi for insight on comparable technology to better market Abreezio.

In October 2015 Abreezio was acquired by Qualcomm for $150 million with Qualcomm under the assumption all parties involved with the technology had been disclosed. The DoJ says Alan received almost $92 million Taneja took over $10 million and two of Shokouhi's entities received $24 million.

According to the indictment the defendants laundered the money through foreign real estate and interest-free loans.

On Tuesday August 9 charges were unsealed against Alan Arabi Taneja and Shokouhi. All but Alan were arrested. Alan awaits extradition proceedings from Canada. A superseding indictment [PDF] charges the lot with fraud and money laundering offenses.

Shokouhi pled not guilty later that day. The pleas of the other defendants have not yet been registered.

The defendants face up to 20 years in jail and fines of $250000 or twice the pecuniary gain/loss for the fraud charges or $500000 for the money laundering charges. They also must forfeit property derived from the fraud.

The Register has asked Qualcomm for its response and will update accordingly. ®

Updated at 23:20 UTC August 11th Qualcomm has sent the following statement.

""Protecting intellectual property is a cornerstone of innovation. We thank the U.S. Department of Justice for its work in this case."""
MU,Micron Technology,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA4LzExL2JldHRlci1idXktYW1kLXZzLW1pY3Jvbi10ZWNobm9sb2d5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: AMD vs. Micron Technology,"Both semiconductor stocks have rallied of late but which one should you be buying?

Semiconductor stocks have been in rally mode since the beginning of July which is evident from the 22% spike in the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index.

The rally in semiconductor stocks has rubbed off positively on the likes of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 0.05%) and Micron Technology (MU 2.78%). While AMD stock has soared nearly 36% since the beginning of July Micron has gained almost 15%.

The spike in AMD stock seems justified as the company has been reporting terrific results thanks to the healthy demand for its chips. However the same cannot be said about Micron as the memory specialist has lost its wheels thanks to a downturn in memory prices. Does this mean that AMD is in a better position to sustain its hot rally and investors should buy its shares over Micron? Let's find out.

AMD is on a roll

AMD released its second-quarter results on Aug. 2 reporting a 70% year-over-year increase in revenue to a record $6.6 billion. The company's operating margin expanded six percentage points over the prior-year period leading to a 67% year-over-year jump in adjusted earnings to $1.05 per share.

AMD saw impressive growth across all its business segments last quarter with the data center segment standing out with an 83% year-over-year spike in revenue to $1.5 billion. The acquisition of Xilinx also boosted AMD's top line and margins. The acquisition sent the company's embedded segment revenue to $1.3 billion a massive year-over-year spike of 2228%.

The chipmaker expects to finish the year with $26.3 billion in revenue. That would be a 60% increase over 2021. More importantly the diverse markets that AMD serves suggest that the company's impressive growth is here to stay for a long time.

For instance AMD's gaming revenue was up 32% year over year in the quarter to $1.7 billion. The segment's impressive growth was driven by a bump in sales of semi-custom chips to gaming console manufacturers such as Sony Microsoft and Valve. All three companies use AMD's semi-custom chips to power their consoles and the good part is that they are witnessing solid demand this year that has prompted manufacturers to increase production.

Meanwhile AMD management claims that the company has gained market share in the PC (personal computer) processor market for nine quarters on the trot thanks to the healthy demand for chips used in notebooks. Wedbush Securities estimates that AMD could keep gaining market share in PCs for the next couple of years from rival Intel. That isn't surprising as AMD enjoys a technology lead over Intel that has allowed it to report impressive growth even when PC sales are declining big time.

In all AMD's market share gains in data centers and PCs and secular growth opportunities in the gaming console space are some of the reasons why analysts expect its earnings to grow at an annual pace of nearly 27% over the next five years. So AMD could remain a top growth stock in the long run.

Micron Technology is in a tough spot

Micron Technology is in the soup right now thanks to an oversupply in the memory market. While AMD has been able to offset the PC market weakness by gaining more share against Intel Micron hasn't been able to do the same.

The company's days of terrific growth are now a thing of the past as the demand for memory chips has dwindled and prices are declining. This explains why Micron now warns that its fiscal 2022 fourth-quarter revenue ""may come in at or below the low end of the revenue guidance range provided in our June 30 earnings call.""

Micron delivered a disappointing guidance toward the end of June missing analysts' expectations by a huge margin as it expects top and bottom lines to contract in the current quarter. The company had guided for $7.2 billion in revenue (plus or minus $400 million) at the midpoint of its guidance range but it looks like it is finding it difficult to meet that mark now.

Micron warns that the challenging memory environment is here to stay for at least a couple of quarters. That's why the company has reduced its fiscal 2023 capital expenditure forecast stating that its outlay next fiscal year would ""be down meaningfully versus FY22."" Analysts are forecasting Micron's revenue and earnings to shrink in fiscal 2023.

The verdict

AMD is the clear winner of this showdown as it is on track to maintain its solid growth even in a tough environment. Micron on the other hand won't be able to recover until and unless there is a turnaround in the memory market. The bad news for Micron is that the growth in memory demand in 2023 is expected to be just 8.3% falling below 10% for the first time ever.

High inflation and fears of an economic downturn are expected to weigh on memory demand. Supply however is expected to increase by 14% leading to an oversupply in the market and lower prices. That's why investors looking to buy a semiconductor stock right now should consider choosing AMD over Micron as the former has the potential to sustain its rally on the back of its tremendous growth.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbGVjdHJvbmljZGVzaWduLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2dpZXMvZW1iZWRkZWQvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMTI0ODQ0My9lbGVjdHJvbmljLWRlc2lnbi1taWNyb24tcGxlZGdlcy10by1pbnZlc3QtNDAtYmlsbGlvbi1pbi11cy1mYWItZXhwYW5zaW9u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Micron Pledges to Invest $40 Billion in U.S. Fab Expansion,"Micron Technology said that it plans to invest $40 billion in its U.S. manufacturing operations through the end of the decade now that there is government money on the table.

The memory chip maker said it would partly fund the expansion with anticipated grants and credits made possible by the recently passed CHIPS and Science Act which aims to hone America's technological edge and restore its crown in chip manufacturing.

President Biden signed the bipartisan bill on Tuesday. It will provide about $52 billion in subsidies and research grants to companies that invest in new U.S. chip factories and limit their expansion plans in China.

Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said the plan to invest $40 billion in its U.S. fabs between now and 2030 will make ""the U.S. home to the most advanced memory manufacturing and R&D in the world.""

Today only one out of every 50 memory chips are made in the U.S.; all of that is produced by Micron. But the company pledged to build enough capacity so that one out of every 10 memory chips will be U.S.-made by the end of the decade.

Micron is one of the world's largest manufacturers of DRAM and 3D NAND flash memory chips along with rivals Samsung and SK Hynx and it sees strong demand for years to come despite a recent dip in demand.

Micron's most advanced research and development (R&D) site is located in Boise Idaho where it also headquartered. But production of its most advanced chips occurs outside the U.S.—in Southeast Asia Japan and Taiwan.

The company said it intends to manufacture chips from its new U.S. fabs at some point after 2025.

Government Aid

The announcement fits in with U.S. goals to reduce its dependence on imports by reshoring more chip fabs. The U.S. is also hoping to shore up the supply chain to fight against future chip shortages like the one the world is currently grappling with.

Micron said that bringing more advanced memory chip-making will ensure U.S. national security and supply chain resilience as demand for memory grows in areas such as autos and the data center driven 5G and AI.

The CHIPS Act will allocate about $52.7 billion in subsidies for firms building additional semiconductor fabs in the U.S. Of that total about $39 billion is reserved for financial incentives for U.S. fab expansions with $2 billion of the total being used to build out additional capacity for legacy chips used in areas like automotive industrial and defense. About $13.2 billion is also available for R&D and workforce development programs.

The White House contends the legislation will ""unlock hundreds of billions more"" in private spending that will boost U.S. competitiveness with China which is also pursuing self-sufficiency when it comes to chips.

The prospect of federal subsidies has spurred record levels of U.S. investment by the world's top chip firms. In recent years Intel Samsung TI and TSMC have announced new fabs with a total price tag of $99 billion.

In early 2022 Intel said it intends to invest at least $20 billion in a sprawling manufacturing site in Ohio—the first phase of a spending plan that could grow to $100 billion over a decade with government assistance.

The U.S. is the global leader in the chip design realm accounting for more than 45% of overall sales of semiconductors. U.S companies also dominate the markets for software tools used to design chips and the high-end machinery to mass-produce them. But the nation only accounts for a fraction of global production.

The U.S. is responsible for about 12% of the world's chip production. At the same time Taiwan South Korea China and other regions in Asia account for about 75% of the total—including most of the top-tier chips.

As the U.S. share of global semiconductor production has slipped from 37% in 1990 political leaders and chip giants alike have sought to reinvigorate a sector that has become a linchpin of the U.S. economy supplying core building blocks to everything from cars to smartphones to military systems.

A Critical ""First Step""

The move will give Micron's operations more geographic diversity at a time when geopolitical instability and supply chain constraints are forcing companies to reevaluate where they build new fabs.

The U.S. investments in the pipeline will ultimately create up to 40000 American jobs including around 5000 technical and operational roles at Micron. The company said the expansion would enrich the area surrounding the new fabs by bolstering education workforce training transportation and other services.

Micron and its most prominent rivals Samsung and SK Hynix of South Korea dominate the global memory chip business. However they are also facing new competition from rivals based in China including YMTC.

The expansion is the first part of the company's previous commitment to put $150 billion into its research and development and manufacturing sites by 2030 which was held up pending approval of the CHIPS Act.

Mehrotra who attended the signing ceremony at the White House said funding from the CHIPS Act is ""an important first step toward strengthening and retaining American technology leadership for decades to come.""

The bill also creates a 25% tax credit for companies engaged in U.S. chip manufacturing to ease the burden of buying chip-maker tools that can cost tens of millions of dollars each. The credits will be worth $24 billion. Micron is ordering EUV lithography tools to upgrade its memory chip fabs. The company plans to start mass-producing advanced memory chips with the systems which can cost more than $100 million each by 2024.

On top of that are tens of billions of dollars to fund fundamental scientific research to spur innovation and development of other U.S. technology that could also give a boost to U.S. chip makers down the road.

Not the Best Timing

For Micron the plan is to implement the investment plan in several phases with production set to launch after 2025. From there Micron's strategy to increase ""overall supply in line with industry demand trends.""

""The manufacturing investments we are planning are necessary to meet long-term market demand"" he explained. ""Soon the U.S. will once again be home to the world's most advanced memory manufacturing.""

The announcement starkly contrasts the grim short-term prospects for the memory-chip market. Micron has warned of a seriously weakening market for both DRAM and NAND signaling that the chip boom is cooling.

CFO Mark Murphy said at an investor's conference on Tuesday the demand slowdown is not only striking laptops and smartphones where Micron Intel and other companies have previously warned of weakness.

He said that ""inventory adjustments"" are also taking place in the data center industrial and automotive sectors as companies attempt to get through inventory that they hoarded during the pandemic.

Given the uncertainty enveloping the U.S. economy ""companies are now being more cautious about the inventory levels they hold"" Murphy said adding that challenges will persist for the next two quarters. ""In conditions like this we've chosen to build up our inventories even more as the pricing in the market isn't reflecting fair value for our products.""

As a result Micron said it will curtail its capital expenditures on its fabs in 2023 to reduce its production output—even as it touts long-term plans to bring advanced memory chip-making to the U.S.

""It's very difficult to stop capex in the very short term and we have some very critical technology programs you need to invest in"" said Murphy. But he said that the company is trying to rein in its spending as demand erodes. ""We are in the process of avoiding reducing and delaying [capital expenditures]. We are pushing things out; we're canceling.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8va2lkb3RhbGtyYWRpby5jb20vbWljcm9uLTQwLWJpbGxpb24tYm9pc2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Micron's 40 Billion Dollar Investment Will Not Include Boise,"Micron is a worldwide leader in the semiconductor industry. The company has been through the good times and the bad.

Micron Technology Spends $150 Billion A look at Micron's role in technology and its leaders present and past.

Boise Mayor Lauren McLean and others hope that Micron will make a major investment in Boise. The company has spent millions and billions building sites in Georgia and Virginia.

Micron Announces 40 Billion Dollar Domestic Investment

Micron announced in a release it would spend 40 billion dollars on building 'leading-edge memory manufacturing in multiple phases in the U.S.' The Boise Dev has been the leader on whether or not Micron will build a massive facility in Boise. The publication details the behavior of Mayor McLean and the legislature's efforts to lure semiconductor manufacturers to the Gem State.

The company predicts their investment will result in the creation of over 40000 jobs for Americans. Micron's leadership credited the passing of the CHIPS + Act with allowing them to invest in America.

“I thank President Biden U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and the full Administration as well as members of Congress for their bipartisan support of the CHIPS and Science Act which is an important step toward solidifying American semiconductor leadership for decades to come. I am honored to take part in this historic White House bill signing ceremony with them and fellow executives” said Micron President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. “This legislation will enable Micron to grow domestic production of memory from less than 2% to up to 10% of the global market in the next decade making the U.S. home to the most advanced memory manufacturing and R&D in the world.”

Why Not Boise?

Micron was created in Boise in 1978. The company only exists because of the dedication of the company's original investors who were rich Idaho businessmen. The headquarters remains in Boise but has outsourced manufacturing to other locations like Taiwan over the past several years.

Inside sources tell us that building a FAB in Boise would be a huge and perhaps unnecessary economic challenge. Sources tell us that the research and development facility is years behind other facilities in the country. Other factors include access to an educated work force and engineering resources. Think MIT Research Triangle Park Silicon Valley or other engineering hot spots.

The spending plan is part of the company’s previously announced $150 billion global investment goal which it detailed last year. President Joe Biden is expected to sign the chips act into law on Tuesday as part of a package of spending and tax reforms. Most of Micron’s production is done in Japan Singapore and Taiwan.

“Micron’s domestic leading-edge manufacturing capabilities will ensure US national security and supply chain resilience as demand for memory grows in critical market segments like automotive and data center fueled by accelerating adoption of artificial intelligence and 5G” the company said in the statement.

The company which competes with South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. as well as Japan’s Kioxia Holdings Corp. said last month that it’s cutting spending on plants and equipment to slow increases in factory output amid concerns about a glut in the market.

In this shifting landscape many manufacturers are investing in innovative solutions to make their products and operations smarter by tapping into advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) AI and digital twins for manufacturing.

Against this backdrop Microsoft decided to spotlight the manufacturing industry for our August 2022 IoT Signals report. IoT Signals is a series of impactful thought leadership content curated by Microsoft to inform the community about the latest developments and technology trends in the IoT industry. The first report published in 2019 provided a broad view of IoT across a variety of industries—from manufacturing and energy to healthcare and retail—based on comprehensive survey-based research.

For this edition of the report IoT Signals: Manufacturing Spotlight Microsoft Intel and IoT Analytics surveyed 500 decision makers working on digital transformation initiatives in discrete hybrid or process manufacturing across North America Europe and Asia Pacific. We conducted more in-depth interviews with some participants to gain a deeper understanding of their transformation strategies execution plans and challenges.

Six key findings about digital transformation and IoT in manufacturing

This new IoT manufacturing report reveals insights from real-world manufacturers that have started their digital transformation journey. It also uncovers fresh learnings about the state of industrial IoT devices and technology in manufacturing specifically in the areas of manufacturing operations and smart products.

During our research we discovered six key digital transformation and IoT manufacturing trends:

Most manufacturers are advancing their efforts to build smart factories. Three out of four survey respondents (72 percent) said they’re implementing their smart factory strategy. Operational improvement is still a top goal for manufacturers. Four out of five survey respondents said they consider overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) to be the most important key performance indicator to measure the success of their smart factory strategy. Organizations are shifting investments to industrial automation-based process control. To date most manufacturers have focused on quality control and condition-based maintenance for smart factory projects. However the need for greater agility is leading these organizations to shift their investments over the next three years to industrial automation-based process control—the use of automated control systems such as IoT and AI to automate manufacturing processes. Manufacturers face new challenges with scaling smart factory initiatives. Half of the respondents said they face challenges in developing new software applications and the majority (eight out of 10) said they’re dealing with skills gaps particularly in data science AI and cybersecurity. IT-OT convergence is happening in the manufacturing industry. With 76 percent of manufacturing assets now connected many manufacturers are moving workloads and applications from on-premises infrastructure to public and private cloud platforms. Manufacturers plan to increase investments in smart connected IoT products. Manufacturing organizations are not only optimizing their own operations with smart connected IoT products—they’re also creating new revenue streams by selling these products to customers. Manufacturers that already sell connected IoT products expect to increase investments from 33 percent today to 47 percent by 2025 with a strong focus on value-added services such as predictive maintenance and remote support.

Read the IoT Signals: Manufacturing Spotlight to learn more about what’s driving these six key trends and holistic understanding of six key components of digital transformation in manufacturing.

Accelerating digital transformation and embracing IoT with Microsoft Cloud for Manufacturing

All six of the key findings from this manufacturing IoT report share a common theme: Manufacturers across the globe are advancing their digital transformation efforts. These organizations are tapping into innovative solutions to reimagine manufacturing and build a more resilient and sustainable future.

By adopting transformative technologies like IoT industrial devices AI and digital twins your manufacturing organization can:

Transform your workforce. Eight out of 10 manufacturers report having at least one important skill gap particularly when it comes to advanced data analysis and IT cybersecurity. In this environment manufacturers are looking for tools that will help them close the gap and boost employee productivity. Today’s manufacturers can transform their workforce by empowering their frontline workers with digital tools and modern devices that enable real-time collaboration enhance training and improve worker health and safety.

Build more agile factories. The ability to adapt quickly to rapid change is a defining factor between manufacturers that simply survive and those that thrive. That’s why manufacturers across the globe are tapping into advanced technologies to build more agile smarter factories.

Create more resilient supply chains. According to the report 74 percent of manufacturers ranked supply chain resilience as a top priority. This is no surprise considering that now more than ever manufacturers are under pressure to prevent and minimize supply chain disruptions. Microsoft Cloud for Manufacturing is already helping manufacturers improve end-to-end supply chain visibility and boost supply chain resilience.

Engage customers in new ways. If you want to gain an edge in the manufacturing industry customer engagement is critical. As manufacturers search for innovative ways to engage customers many are selling smart connected IoT products. Our research shows that 33 percent of manufacturers’ product revenue comes from smart products today.

Drive innovation and deliver new services. Manufacturers are investing in advanced technologies to create a more resilient future. According to our research 28 percent of manufacturers have rolled out digital twins and four percent of them have fully deployed them in their factories. Another 45 percent of manufacturers are in development and proof of concept (POC) stage for digital twins and 39 percent are in the same stage for augmented reality (AR).

Decrease your environmental impact. Most manufacturing board members (59 percent) believe that decreasing their carbon footprint is an important area of focus. Manufacturers are uniquely positioned to drive sustainability while saving costs and improving safety using cloud-based automation machine learning and AI.

Improve security. Security is a top priority for manufacturing organizations and 62 percent of manufacturers have strict data privacy policies. Over the next three years manufacturers plan to decrease the mean time to detect cybersecurity incidents by 30 percent.

Build a resilient future with IoT manufacturing

Manufacturing organizations are drawing from the lessons learned during COVID-19 to develop resilience and build a better future. Digital transformation continues to be top of mind for these manufacturers as they work to increase agility improve customer engagement and drive growth.

While Microsoft isn’t officially commenting on the end of its Modern Life initiative a Microsoft senior designer revealed there was “hard news” for the Modern Life Experiences team this week in a LinkedIn post. The news comes weeks after Microsoft cut less than 1 percent of its 180000-person workforce with job cuts in consulting and customer and partner solutions. Microsoft has also been cutting open job roles as it slows hiring amid a weakening economy.

But as demand slows for the first generation of coronavirus vaccines Moderna is laying plans to build out its portfolio in the years to come.

Alongside its planned omicron-targeting shots for this fall Moderna expects a combination COVID flu and respiratory syncytial virus shot will be developed over ""three to five years"" CEO Stéphane Bancel told CNN Business.

Bancel compared the continual improvement of the company's COVID-19 vaccine franchise to that of Apple's hugely successful iPhone. ""You don't get the amazing camera amazing everything the first time you get an iPhone but you get a lot of things."" Then over time the product improves he added.

Meanwhile Moderna is testing a suite of COVID-19 shots tailored to individual virus variants. The company's pipeline shows seven tweaked versions of the original vaccine plus the ""next-generation"" mRNA-1283 with a longer expected refrigerated shelf life.

And Moderna doesn't plan to be solely a COVID-19 vaccine maker. The company's pipeline shows dozens of candidates against numerous infectious diseases cancer and more.

Related The top 20 pharma companies by 2021 revenue

Over the last two-plus years Moderna has kept busy—and grown significantly—as the pandemic vaulted it into biopharma's top 20 companies by revenue.

But even after Moderna recently revealed expansions in four Asian markets and six European countries the company isn't done growing its geographic reach Bancel told CNN. The company aims to operate in ""40 to 60 countries"" in the next three years.

Amid the expansion push recent months have provided new challenges for the company. Moderna posted a 2200% revenue jump in 2021 but vaccine demand has been slipping lately. In fact the company recorded a $499 million write-off for unused inventory in the second quarter of 2022.

""We ended up destroying the vaccines"" Bancel told CNN adding that it was ""heartbreaking.""

Moderna and other vaccine makers say the demand decline is temporary. Late last month the company inked its latest supply deal with the U.S. government.

Forget taking two to three Covid shots a year. Moderna hopes to roll out a single-dose annual booster to cover the coronavirus the flu and another common respiratory virus within the next five years.

As Covid-19 continues to mutate Moderna will need to keep updating the vaccines that turned it into a global household name while trying to make it more convenient for consumers CEO Stéphane Bancel said in an interview with CNN Business Wednesday.

He estimated a timeline of “three to five years” for the new combined product and likened the development of the life-saving jab to that of a smartphone.

“You don’t get the amazing camera amazing everything the first time you get an iPhone but you get a lot of things” he said.

“A lot of us buy a new iPhone every September and you get new apps and you get refreshed apps. And that’s exactly the same idea which is you’ll get Covid and flu and RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] in your single dose.”

Having recorded breakneck growth during the pandemic Moderna (MRNA) is now under pressure to identify its next big frontier.

Bancel believes the Covid-19 pandemic that helped the company rack up tens of billions of dollars in revenue and generate business in more than 70 markets globally could end as soon as this year.

That doesn’t mean the virus is going anywhere he noted.

“I think we are slowly moving — if not already in some countries — to a world where all the tools are available and everybody can make their own decision based on their risk tolerance” he explained adding that he believed more people would choose to “live with the virus” much like they do with the flu.

The approach however will continue to vary greatly such as among people who are immunocompromised or in countries like Japan where it was common to wear masks even before the pandemic he acknowledged.

And “there’s always a 20% probability that we get a very nasty variant that drives very severe disease that has a lot of mutation” he added.

The next big thing

Still Moderna is determined not to become a one-hit wonder.

The company has more than 40 products in development and is planning for life well beyond Covid-19 said Bancel.

In addition to an updated annual booster it is continuing to develop a personalized cancer vaccine for which new clinical data will drop later this year. Bancel said the product could go up for approval in roughly two years if all goes well.

The company is also exploring a potential monkeypox jab which is “still in the lab today” Bancel said. The World Health Organization declared the global outbreak of the illness a public health emergency of international concern last month.

And Moderna is looking to catch up to competitors overseas.

Earlier this year it announced a push into 10 Asian and European markets including Singapore Hong Kong Denmark and the Netherlands. The investments will cost “dozens of millions of dollars” and include hundreds of new hires said Bancel.

He sees that as just one wave of expansion that will eventually take Moderna from directly operating in 12 countries this year to “40 to 60 countries” over the next three years.

The company also recently signed manufacturing agreements in the United Kingdom South Korea and Australia and is hoping to set up one or two more plants in Southeast Asia or North Asia.

Bancel said the new facilities would be crucial to helping adapt its products to different strains of illnesses that develop around the world.

As the world first dealt with the onset of Covid-19 Moderna was one of the handful of large manufacturers that rushed to get their vaccines ready reducing timelines from years to months. Its stock rallied 434% in 2020 and 143% last year.

But now like peers Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) the firm’s stock has slumped dropping more than 30% so far this year and 64% from its all-time high a year ago.

Last week the company revealed that it took a writedown of nearly $500 million in the second quarter partly because of a sudden cancellation of orders from Covax the international vaccination program for lower-income countries.

The reversal led to huge losses for the company which had bought new machines to fulfill those orders and more importantly resulted in Covid vaccines being thrown in the trash said Bancel.

“We ended up destroying the vaccines” he said. “It was really heartbreaking.”

The CEO said he wasn’t worried about that kind of slide in demand being repeated in richer countries in part because governments had already shown commitments to use vaccines later this year to avoid reintroducing economic lockdowns.

But “on the low-income country side yes I am worried” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbW9kZXJuYS1jZW8tY29tcGFyZXMtbmV3LWNvdmlkLTE5LXZhY2NpbmVzLWlwaG9uZXMtMjAyMi040gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9tb2Rlcm5hLWNlby1jb21wYXJlcy1uZXctY292aWQtMTktdmFjY2luZXMtaXBob25lcy0yMDIyLTg_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Moderna CEO compares new COVID-19 vaccines to iPhones,"Moderna's CEO compared a future COVID-19 vaccine to the iPhone saying we will need a new one every year.

Moderna's CEO compared COVID-19 vaccines to iPhones saying you'll probably need to get a new version once every year.

Stéphane Bancel told CNN Business that he predicts the world will see a once-a-year vaccine in the coming years that protects against strains of COVID-19 the flu or any other prevalent viruses — all in one shot.

""We think we can put in a single product a lot of mRNAs taking care of all of those viruses. And that's once a year. You should be able to get an annual booster a single dose that has in the vial all those mRNAs for all those viruses that are of course adapted to the strain of a season like flu like COVID strain and so on"" Bencel told CNN.

The same holds for commercial real estate services and investment firm CBRE. In February the company pointed out that its teams had recently “closed deals involving hundreds of thousands of square feet of space for life sciences companies.”

According to Stéphanie Doyle Director – Life Sciences at Montréal International the timing of Moderna’s decision to join the local ecosystem couldn’t be better.

“Moderna’s arrival reinforces the strength of our life sciences and health technology ecosystem. This is a turning point because the new facility has the potential to accelerate growth in the sector by developing projects that meet critical needs” said Ms. Doyle. “By choosing Québec Moderna will be able to tap into a pool of highly skilled talent to move its ambitious projects forward.”

Skilled talent to address pressing needs

“The availability of talent is a major factor in attracting such projects. Québec and Greater Montréal have everything it takes right here to develop the next generation of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical solutions to address the most pressing healthcare needs” said Stéphane Paquet President and CEO of Montréal International. “Foreign businesses can take advantage of a welcoming interconnected ecosystem that is built on a commitment to cooperation among industry academia and research institutions.”

With over 46000 professionals in Québec and close to 40000 students enrolled in STEM and life sciences programs Montréal (which accounts for 80% of the province’s ecosystem) clearly has an edge.

Diversified hubs spread across the city

Québec’s LSHT sector is well diversified. The province boasts over 1000 companies that manufacture medical equipment or develop and distribute pharmaceutical and homeopathic solutions.

In recent years drawn by our AI ecosystem companies like Roche Servier Novartis and Recursion have come to Greater Montréal and opened research centres in the region.

LSHT companies are concentrated in five clusters across Greater Montréal: in Montréal’s West Island the Saint-Laurent borough Vaudreuil-Soulanges Longueuil and Biotech City in Laval. The latter is home to the INRS Armand-Frappier Santé Biotechnologie Research Centre where researchers are working on close to 30 COVID-19-related projects.

With its rich pool of talent and internationally recognized research facilities the metropolitan region excels in a field that holds a lot of potential and is poised for accelerated growth in coming years.

It will be the pharmaceutical giant's first manufacturing facility outside the United States and cost an estimated $180 million to construct.

Moderna says it has agreed to purchase land in the Montreal suburb's biotechnology park to serve as the site of its biomanufacturing facility.

The Massachusetts-based company says the site is ideal because it is home to a campus of a renowned Quebec research institute the Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS).

Moderna announced in April that it would build a factory in the Montreal area that would produce about 30 million vaccine doses a year with the ability to ramp up production to 100 million a year should there be a need.

The company also said it would employ between 200 and 300 people.

The facility is expected to produce vaccines not only against COVID-19 but also targeting various respiratory viruses including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus or RSV.

The company says the facility is expected to be operational by the end of 2024 ""subject to planning and regulatory approvals.''

Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante chose to treat the news as a win for the region today rather than disappointment for her city.

Plante had stated in April that the facility would be in Montreal and Quebec Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon indicated in June that it would be built in the city's Saint-Laurent borough.

""It's great news to see businesses settling in the metropolitan area. The arrival of Moderna strengthens our position of choice in the life sciences sector and confirms the attractiveness and dynamism of Greater Montreal"" said Plante in a statement Thursday.

It appears proximity to the INRS was Moderna's deciding factor.

""This location offers tremendous synergies to Moderna due to its proximity to a renowned research institute in addition to fitting the requirements of the project and its importance to all Canadians and Quebecers'' the company said in a news release.

""Moderna is proud to share the promise of mRNA science with Quebec to tackle the world's greatest public health threats.''

The INRS and the mayor of Laval also celebrated the news on Thursday.

""There is no doubt that welcoming a partner of this stature will contribute to the influence of the Laval biotechnology park in Quebec and Canada"" said an INRS statement.

In April it was announced that the agreement to open the facility came with a pledge from the federal government to prioritize vaccine stock purchases from Moderna during future epidemics or disease outbreaks."

A crowd of people showed up Tuesday evening at the Marlboro County Council meeting.

Many workers from Mohawk's Oak River Mills were in the crowd.

TRENDING:

We first told you last week the mill is closing in October after 65 years in the county.



Some of the workers spoke during the council meeting. One man questioned if the company could have avoided a permanent shutdown.

We here in Marlboro County the ones that worked at the plant are hard working people. We have dedicated our lives. Sacrificed times away from our families for this company. Just all of a sudden they come look at three plants and made a decision"" said Frederick Davis.

A company spokesperson says they're shifting production to other locations.



TRENDING:

They say the closing is no reflection on the workers.

“The news of Oak River’s closing was unexpected especially considering the County Council had just approved new tax incentives for the company in April of this year and at that time there was no indication of plans to close the site. Marlboro County has a long-standing record of assisting Mohawk and even developed a free bus route in 2017 to transport employees to and from the site"" said Marlboro County Administrator Ron Munnerlyn.



At one time the plant employed more than 1000 people. It’s not clear how many people are employed at the factory now.



Many people in the community said they’re hoping that the county will bounce back and attract another company that will hire hundreds of workers.

The company announced in a release that operations will stop on Oct. 6.

MIAMI Aug. 10 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Brave Health  a virtual-first behavioral health provider focused on serving Medicaid populations announced significant revenue growth in the last year has reached a milestone of 65M covered lives and expanded operations to 18 states through more than 200 health plan contracts. The company also announced its first value-based contract with Molina Healthcare of Texas a partnership designed to innovate on the measurement of and reimbursement for outcomes related to transitions of care for members with psychiatric conditions.

Today access to mental health services for the nation's most traditionally underserved populations is a public health crisis. The percentage of psychiatrists accepting Medicaid has dropped to 35% according to previous research reported by JAMA Psychiatry . With nearly one in four Americans now using Medicaid this gap leaves many without access to ongoing critical mental health care.

""The demand for mental health services continues to rise nationally yet access and engagement gaps are widening"" said Anna Lindow CEO and co-founder Brave Health. ""Our goal is to tackle this challenge head-on with a growing presence across regions and a commitment to driving a systemic change in the way behavioral healthcare is delivered and paid for in the U.S.""

Brave Health approaches mental health through the lens of engagement and outcomes. The company takes a step-by-step approach to improving results – first getting individuals into care quickly and then providing continuous support to keep them engaged in their treatment. The Brave Health team employs nearly 200 behavioral health providers including therapists psychiatrists peer support specialists and nurse practitioners all of whom work together to dramatically improve patient outcomes and reduce costs for health plans.

To power improved behavioral health outcomes for people with Medicaid Brave Health pairs innovation in care delivery and engagement with innovation in payment models. Working in tandem with the case management team at Molina Healthcare of Texas Brave Health is proactively engaging select members as they are discharged from the hospital to be engaged in a six-month episode of care during which Brave Health will place specific focus on quality outcomes measures such as seven- and 30-day follow-up appointment completion and ongoing care delivery. Participants will have the option to continue care from Brave Health indefinitely to ensure continuous support in their mental health journeys.

Recent analysis of Brave Health's Transitions of Care work with other state Medicaid plans consistently shows as high as 100% improvement rates in follow-up after hospitalization rates at the seven- and 30-day marks for individuals hospitalized for a psychiatric illness.

""Molina Healthcare is committed to improving the health and well-being of those in the communities we serve throughout Texas"" said Chris Coffey plan president of Molina Healthcare of Texas. ""We are proud to partner with Brave Health in order to implement even more innovative methods of care to meet the ever-increasing behavioral health needs across our state.""

In addition to expanding partnerships Brave Health is expanding geographically. While in early 2021 only 5% of referrals Brave Health received were for individuals living outside Florida by the end of the first quarter of 2022 that number had grown to more than 30%. Brave Health is now serving members in Florida New York Texas and 15 other states with plans to expand to at least five more states before the end of 2022.

Molson Coors Beverage Company has launched a draught version of its flagship hard seltzer Three Fold to the UK on-trade following a successful trial of Three Fold’s ‘Red Berries’ flavour on draught at five venues in London Manchester and Edinburgh.

Monster started its alcohol journey with the acquisition of CANarchy Craft Beer Collective​ – a craft beer and hard seltzer company – for $330m in January this year.

The acquisition brought key brands such as Cigar City (Jai Alai IPA and Florida Man IPA) Oskar Blues (Dale’s Pale Ale and Wild Basin Hard Seltzer) Deep Ellum (Dallas Blonde and Deep Ellum IPA) Perrin Brewing (Black Ale) Squatters (Hop Rising Double IPA and Juicy IPA) and Wasatch (Apricot Hefeweizen) into the Monster beverage portfolio.

Net sales for Monster’s Alcohol Brands segment which is comprised of the various craft beers and hard seltzers purchased as part of the CANarchy transaction on February 17 2022 were $32.4m for Q2 2022 (this being Monster's first full quarter in alcohol).

Monster labelled this acquisition as its ‘springboard to enter the alcoholic beverage sector’​ gaining a fully in-place infrastructure including people distribution and licenses along with alcoholic beverage development expertise and manufacturing capabilities in the industry.

Less than a year later the launch of The Beast Unleashed is set to follow. While Monster has revealed few details about drink's flavors look or target audience Sacks says it ‘will leverage Monster’s brand equity while carving out its own unique space in the beverage alcohol sector and will be distinguishable from the many hard seltzer brands that have become so ubiquitous over the last several years’.​

There will be four flavors in the line: as of yet unrevealed but 'full-bodied bold flavors' taking their inspiration from Monster’s ‘well-known and popular flavor profiles’ (of which Monster has nearing 40: ranging from a variety of tropical punch style flavors through to coffee/chocolate).

The drink will initially be offered in 16 oz single-serve cans as well as in a 12 can variety pack with 12 oz sleek cans.

The Beast Unleashed will be launched through beer distributors in the US in state-by-state phases starting at the end of the year. Monster aims for the drink to have national distribution by the end of 2023.

'Our alcohol innovation pipeline is robust'

But past the launch of The Beast Unleashed Sacks promises a long-term strategy in alcohol with several other alcoholic beverages in the works.

This year the company has filed for a raft of trademarks in the alcoholic beverage category: including Juice Monster Spiked Hard Juice Monster Khaotic Dragon Tea Eden Apple Aussie Style Lemonade and Pacific Punch: suggesting the company is considering both new brands and line extensions.

“​Our alcohol innovation pipeline is robust with a number of additional innovative product lines currently under development”​ said Sacks in last week’s earnings call. “We look forward to sharing news of such additional alcohol beverage products at a later date.” ​

The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo have both launched into RTD alcohol (more on this below...) through tie-ups with alcohol beverage companies who boast the appropriate know-how in the alcohol beverage sector: knowing this can differ enormously from soft drinks from regulatory processes to distribution set-ups.

Monster however has the infrastructure of its CANarchy acquisition as well as the option acquire other players in alcohol or create partnerships with alcohol beverage players.

From soft drinks to RTD alcohol

Monster’s move into alcoholic beverages is just the latest in a series of plays by soft drinks companies into alcohol: more precisely the booming RTD segment.

Hard Mtn Dew

PepsiCo launched Hard Mtn Dew in February year in partnership with The Boston Beer Company.

The 5% ABV is caffeine-free with zero added sugar and 100 calories per serving with 'new differentiated graphics' to highlight the hard proposition.

It comes in four flavors: Original Baja Blast Black Cherry and Watermelon.

(Monster's drink will come in at a higher 6% ABV; but expect similarly bold designs to tie in with the company's branding. Monster also appears to appreciate the value of zero sugar options given the upcoming launch of Monster Energy Zero Sugar​ back over in the non-alcoholic category at the end of this year.)

Carbonated soft drink Mtn Dew is one of PepsiCo’s top beverage brands: which has been pushing into energy with caffeinated Mtn Dew Rise Energy (launched in March) and Mtn Dew Amp Game Fuel (launched in 2018).

In the case of Hard Mtn Dew PepsiCo has licensed the brand to Boston Beer which is producing the product while PepsiCo has set up a new entity - Blue Cloud Distribution - for the wholesale operations including sales distribution and merchandising.

Speaking in last month's earnings call PepsiCo CEO Ramon L. Laguarta said the company is positive about the potential of the product after the first few months - as well as the wider potential to continue developing in the category.

Another high-profile move into alcohol is that of The Coca-Cola Company: which launched Topo Chico Hard Seltzer​​​ last year in partnership with Molson Coors (in the US Molson Coors takes on responsibility for the manufacture marketing and distribution of the drink).

The company described the launch as a ‘natural evolution’ of its premium Mexican water brand Topo Chico: taking the non-alcoholic brand smoothly into the alcohol category thanks to the alcohol know-how of Molson Coors. Its hard seltzer comes in at 4.7% ABV (again Monster’s 6% ABV will be considerably higher).

And of course as a soft drink company any growth in the alcohol category is incremental with most hard seltzer fans migrating to the category from beer.

Coca-Cola has also launched the drink outside of the US: in fact using Latin America as an early test market and launching in Europe slightly ahead of the US thanks to a simpler distribution system.

Coca-Cola is now building on its moves into alcohol with an alcoholic version of Fresca​​​ this year via a collaboration with Constellation Brands. This will see the zero-calorie grapefruit citrus-flavored soft drink and cocktail mixer – currently the fastest-growing trademark in The Coca-Cola Company’s US soft drink portfolio – launch a line of full-flavored spirit-based RTDs.

In this instance it sees Fresca Mixed appealing to consumers searching for ‘fuller-flavored experiences’ and higher-quality RTD cocktails to bridge the space between refreshing hard seltzers and bar cocktails.

In a similar arrangement as with Molson Coors on Topo Chico Constellation Brands is responsible for producing marketing and distributing Fresca mixed: drawing on its distilled manufacturing and operational capabilities and national distilled distribution network with access to retailers in this category.

And next up will be the launch of a Jack & Coke RTD canned cocktail:​ delivered via a partnership between Coca-Cola and Brown-Forman.

The 5% ABV drink will launch in Mexico at the end of the year in anticipation of a global rollout.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlYWZseS5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9jYW5hZGFzLXdlZWQtYmV2ZXJhZ2VzLWFyZS1hLXN1bW1lci1zdWNjZXNz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Canada's weed beverages are this summer's secret success story (finally),"Gone are the days of ""kelpy flavour""; the next generation of cannabis drinks are winning. (Courtesy bukhta79/Adobe Stock)

There were some pretty big promises made to consumers about legalization 2.0 in Canada and the ushering in of new concentrates vapes and namely infused beverages.

As a cannabis reporter I took an early interest in the phenomenon of cannabis beverages —or rather the promises being made by cannabis beverage manufacturers.

Producers had a year from federal legalization in 2018 to craft new formulas and flavours and the industry made especially wild promises about weed beverages overtaking alcohol sales.

That might have been a little ambitious—they weren’t then able to sell the drinks at the rate they had hoped.

It might have been a bit high-minded; the promises being made were big… but so were the deals. AB InBev had just signed a $100-million beverage development deal; Canopy was swimming in capital from Constellation Brands and were pouring more than $700 million into a bottling facility and Hexo had partnered with Molson Coors to birth an upstart beverage-only company called Truss.

Nevertheless license holders were on a quest to find as they told me in Merry Jane the “perfect product to dissolve all boundaries between people who use cannabis and those who don’t.”

Fast forward three years. Cannabis drinks have firmly established themselves in the cannabis 2.0 lineup. They genuinely represent an innovative and unique spin on cannabis consumption.

But did they do what their creators promised—that is have they created a cannabis drink with a 15-minute alcohol-comparative onset? Have they created something to compete with alcohol that amounts to more than just a liquid edible?

Failures in the first wave lost customers and capital

Cannabis drinks arrived on shelves slowly with the first brands showing up in the early pre-pandemic part of 2020. Initial reviews were decidedly mixed. Most available options were low-dose 2 mg-ish offerings and they hadn’t yet nailed the taste.

“It’s an acquired taste” wrote one reviewer. “I couldn’t finish the can.”

“The first generation of drinks they were just putting distillate in the drinks and when you put distillate in the drinks it sticks to the inside of the can. For all the hype and everything around this category the manufacturers didn’t do a good enough job to actually impress. It was really disappointing.” – Derek Prentice founder of Proper cannabis beverage company

Another reviewer in the Toronto Star noted the “slightly filmy texture and mouth feel” of one Veryvell sparkling water drink and the “kelpy flavour” of another—blame the glycerin that was being used to infuse many of the first gen of cannabis drinks.

Many agreed that the drinks mostly did what they promised and got them high but both the so-so taste and 30-minute onset proved there was clear room for improvement.

The main obstacle Prentice recalls was the tech: drinks manufacturers rushing to market were using distillates and oils struggling with a vexing problem (first identified in California) where the lining of the cans was degrading the cannabinoids.

“The worst part about the first tranche of drinks was that if they sat on the shelf for three months the effectiveness went way down.” Then with the arrival of the pandemic and stalling retail stores drinks were sitting on the shelf for a while.

By mid-year though the massive investments in the sector were starting to bear fruit. Truss’ first offerings hit the shelves in August 2020 and smaller players like Prentice began to fine-tune their emulsions. In Proper’s case they began working with Vertosa a nano-emulsion supplier from the United States.

Getting nano-emulsions right was the key Prentice says. Vertosa in particular claims that their nano-emulsion technology solves the oily drinks problem and their reactions with the can lining.

Companies have tapped other suppliers but the idea has been consistent—Versus’ Black Cherry Rapid Seltzer the second-best selling product in Ontario uses nano-emulsions from a Seattle-based company called SōRSE.

The early generation of drinks often had onset times between 30 minutes and two hours—like other edibles. Nano-emulsions on the other hand allowed cannabinoids to enter your system as soon as they touched the inside of your mouth (many budtenders recommend swishing drinks in your mouth as you sip).

This also essentially squashed the more ambitious unproven suggestions to brew infused drinks directly from cannabis plants.

“The technology we used has been consistent since we launched” says Melanie Smith director of innovation at Truss. “We did a lot of due diligence. We really do have beverage experts that are used to working within these formats.”

If you ask Prentice solving the nano-emulsion issue helped the industry clear the biggest hurdle: efficacy. To compete with alcohol they had to solve the age-old problem of slow-acting unpredictable edibles. “Efficacy is always important” says Prentice. “Always. In my opinion it is right on the same level as flavour.”

2022: Pot drink summer?

With most of the industry employing nano-emulsion production tech the technical issues for a cannabis drink with a 15-minute or less onset have eased.

The industry now turns to the next: getting people to actually drink them.

On that front progress has been slow. According to recent data from Headset drinks account for only 1.9% of cannabis sales in Ontario; in B.C. It’s 1.5%. This past April Labatt Breweries pulled out by shuttering Fluent their cannabis drinks arm.

The push however is on to boost the category with Truss president Dave Schlosser calling 2022 the “summer of cannabis-infused beverages.” The category seems poised to find its footing and the return of more social events makes cannabis drinks a viable alternative to alcohol. “Year to date drinks are growing by 45%” Smith says.

In Ontario drinks have quietly doubled their market share in the past year with Truss saying their data shows a 2.4% market share. “The trends are definitely heading in the right direction with drinks” she says.

Part of that is the increased selection and improved offerings. Collective Project made by artisanal brewery Collective Arts line of cannabis drinks has been a quick hit with consumers currently the top-selling beverage in Ontario. (Their Yuzu Blood Orange Vanilla was recommended by several budtenders I’ve queried.) Sweet Justice Cherry Cola produced by independent company Electric Brands is the second top seller in B.C.

“There has been a massive boom of new brands and new products coming online. I think consumers have more choices than they’ve ever had. It’s gotten more competitive and you have to step up your game. This spring/summer we’ve launched 15 new products alone.” – Melanie Smith director of innovation at Truss

Where the boom settles is still anyone’s guess. The industry has lobbied heavily for regulation changes— consumers are currently capped at purchasing five 355 ml drinks—to improve access and hopefully bring consumers’ cost-per-drink but there’s not been much reaction from Health Canada. They’re also improving production Smith says.

Beverage formulators are refining their methods and manufacturers have pivoted towards more potent drinks that approach the 10 mg cap without compromising flavour. Growing the cannabis drinks category is slow but its proponents believe there’s still a lot of potential—approaching 4 or 5 % market share is probably not unrealistic Smith says.

Craft producers like Prentice see that upside too. “From a longevity perspective the beverage category will continue to grow” he says. Like other parts of the cannabis industry he believes the second wave of producers many of them independent will improve upon the foundations sketched out by larger producers.

“I definitely think this is here to stay. I’ve talked to so many people who have quit drinking alcohol and switched to cannabis beverages” he says. “If you want a low-calorie beverage there’s that. If you want a low-sugar drink there’s that too. There’s a different drink for everybody.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyZWVodWdnZXIuY29tL2JlZXItY2FuLW1hcmtldC11bnN1c3RhaW5hYmxlLTU2ODIxOTfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Beer Can Is an Unsustainable Tale of Convenience Corporate Concentration and Profit,"In the United States only about 3% of beer is sold in returnable bottles. North of the border in Canada until recently it was a very different story. When I first wrote about this a decade ago as much as 88% of the beer was sold in returnable and refillable bottles.

Refillable bottles are much better this is for the environment: Studies have shown that using a refillable bottle uses 93% less energy than making a new container. And the washing water? It takes between ""47 percent and 82 percent less water than is needed to manufacture new one-way bottles for the delivery of the same amount of beverage.""

By 2021 cans are outselling bottles by well over 2:1. Ontario Beer Store Sustainability Report

But recently I went into the local craft brewery and there was not a bottle to be found. Everything was being sold in cans and they told me they were not bottling anymore. When you go to the Brewers Retail store—now branded as “the Beer Store"" operated by the consortium owned by the breweries that until recently sold all the beer in Ontario—it seems all you can buy is canned beer except for a few big classic brands.

They blame the pandemic and claim people are not bringing back empties but I suspect that is just a convenient excuse. The bottle seems to be disappearing from the Ontario scene.

The Disappearing Refillable Bottle Is a Tragedy

Only one lone brand of bottled beer left in our local store. Lloyd Alter

This is in many ways an environmental tragedy. According to Brewers Retail stewardship reports the returnable bottles would be reused 35 times and it was by far the most energy and carbon-efficient system. I have always claimed it was a model for how we should be living with every product; let’s put deposits on everything and get our milk and pop the way our grandparents did in returnable bottles.

But we live in a culture of convenience and beer bottles are not as convenient as they used to be. The Ontario government recently allowed beer to be sold in grocery stores and soon it will be available in corner stores which do not want to deal with bottle returns. The real estate market is nuts and many beer stores are being redeveloped into condos so there are fewer places to return the bottles.

I would never buy cans for all these reasons and pleaded with my kids to avoid them for health reasons; they are of the age when they can have children and the cans are lined with a Bisphenol-A epoxy that is an endocrine disruptor.

I would rattle on about how much lower the carbon footprint of beer in bottles is compared to that of beer in cans and just got blank stares in return because nobody drank crappy mainstream stuff in bottles when you could get the cool craft stuff in cans. And the other day I bought six cans of beer from the local Lake of Bays Brewery for the first time.

I blame Bill Coors.

The History of the Beer Can

The eponymous head of a beer company hundreds of miles away in another country in another century. In 1959 he unleashed the 2-piece aluminum beer can that changed the world.

Bill Coors didn’t invent the beer can—that is usually credited to the American Can Company. They started working on steel beer cans in 1909 but faced two problems: the tendency to explode (fixed by a change in the steel and solder) and the taste of the beer which reacted with the steel resulting in “metal turbidity” rendering the beer discolored and undrinkable. The turbidity and taste problem was resolved through the use of enamels waxes and synthetic vinyl (Vinylite). None of these did a very good job and the lining of cans remains a problem to this day.

There wasn’t much of a market for them either. Beer was mostly sold in taverns until prohibition turned off the taps. When prohibition ended in 1933 one could buy beer but most of the taverns were gone so the brewers switched to returnable and refillable bottles and people started drinking at home. American Can approached the Gottfried Krueger Brewery in Richmond Virginia which reluctantly agreed to try the cans offering them for sale in 1935.

They were evidently a hit: “Compared to glass the cans were lightweight cheap and easy to stack and ship. Unlike bottles you didn't have to pay a deposit and then return the cans for a refund.” Instead they could just be thrown away. It was convenient but it still tasted tinny. And they were expensive compared to returnable bottles which dominated the take-home market.

Bottled beer worked because the bottles didn’t have to travel very far; they are heavy and the round trip from brewery to beer store could get expensive if the trip were long. There had to be lots of breweries to service the keg and bottle market; in Ontario Canada where I live the O’keefe brewing company had five breweries in Ottawa Windsor and Toronto. Even national brands were essentially local. Highways were narrow and slow and refrigerated trucks and trailers were cooled by heavy ice or expensive dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide.)

This all changed after the Second World War with the building of the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways and the refinement of the refrigerated truck and trailer (reefers) invented in 1935 by Frederick McKinley Jones. His company boomed throughout the Second World War and Jones became recognized as the first African-American to receive the National Medal of Technology.

It wasn’t the can on its own that changed Coors and the beer world forever but the confluence of the highways and the reefers. When you read the official history of Coors they describe how Bill Coors had “a passion for the environment” and developed the can to solve this problem.

“In the 1950s cans were made of steel and thrown away with abandon. Everywhere. The steel cans not only littered the environment and became a health hazard but they lent a metallic taste to the beer. Bill Coors sought a solution for both issues.”

But Bill Coors had another problem: His beer was unpasteurized and because of the seams on steel cans he couldn’t get them sterile enough to keep his beer fresh. It also had to be kept cold.

Consequently he could only supply beer to 11 states. A relative Darren Coors writes that Bill Coors realized “the costs savings associated with cans allowed him to compete in markets farther away from Golden Colorado like Chicago so he knew it was quite a valuable container for the future of his family business.”

Coors invested millions in refining the two-piece aluminum can and brought it to market in 1959 transporting it to market in reefer trailers on the marvelous highways built by the U.S. government. The highway and the reefer changed the economics of the beer business and soon Coors was available coast to coast.

Bill Coors didn’t patent the can but offered it for free to other brewers so that the economics of scale would drive down the cost of making and shipping cans. The economics of scale worked in the breweries too and Coors could supply the entire country from Golden Colorado.

Over the next few decades all those local breweries disappeared. Our O’Keefe breweries became part of Carling-O’Keefe which was absorbed by Molson which merged to form Molson Coors the largest brewer in North America. The disposable aluminum can cheap fossil-fueled transport and concrete highways changed the world of beer forever.

Alas the story and this chapter don’t end here; it just gets worse.

Recycling Aluminum Isn't Effective

From Bill Coors in 1959 to today everyone talks about how recyclable aluminum cans are and how energy-efficient the process is. And by the standard of any other product the recycling rate of aluminum cans is high. But still only 50% of cans are recovered and since the world consumes more aluminum than is recycled only 73% of the aluminum in the average can is recycled content. The rate of recycling is also dropping every year as cities give up on recycling programs since they lose so much money; aluminum is about the only thing of value in the recycling bin.

Meanwhile the builders of airplanes Teslas and MacBooks want virgin aluminum that exactly meets their specifications. The aluminum rolling mills get more money for virgin than they do for recycled aluminum so the cans are piling up and beer can makers can’t get enough sheet aluminum. Instead they are importing it much of it from Saudi Arabia where it is not made with hydropower. The director of packaging procurement for Molson-Coors told the Wall Street Journal “We’d prefer to purchase domestic can sheet but as of right now there is not enough to supply the domestic market.”

In the U.S. people have been drinking from single-use packaging for years but north of the border not many did until the pandemic hit. Now refillables are hard to find and it is doubtful they will ever return as the beer stores are turned into condo sites and the grocery store oligopolies take over the market.

And every step of the way we pay a price in embodied carbon: in the mining and processing of the virgin aluminum; in shipping longer distances; and in the collecting de-inking melting rolling and extruding of new cans and then lining them with epoxies made from gender-bending bisphenol-A. All in the name of convenience corporate concentration and profit.

And after writing all this I need a beer."

Committed to Mindful Snacking Mondelēz said it has long invested in offering wellbeing choices for consumers from launching portion-control pack formats to adding Snack Mindfully icon to all packs and supporting consumers with information.

Mondelēz said teams of makers and bakers have developed non-HFSS products for its iconic candy brands in the form of Maynards Bassetts Wine Gums Juicies Maynards Bassetts Sports Mix Juicies and The Natural Confectionery Co. Juicy Snakes each of which includes 30% less sugar.

These new launches contain fruit juice natural colours and flavours which do not compromise on taste.

The Natural Confectionery Co. Juicy Snakes will be available in UK & Ireland retailers from this month along with Maynards Bassetts Wine Gums Juicies and Maynards Bassetts Sports Mix Juicies. The company releases these new non-HFSS products alongside the original products that have been established in the UK for over a century.

Louise Stigant UK Managing Director at Mondelēz International said: “I’m proud of the non-HFSS ranges that we are developing in categories such as biscuits confectionary and drinking chocolate. This is a result of a significant amount of work and investments that we have made to find opportunities to innovate and reformulate products so that we can give consumers more choice.​

“As custodians of some of the UK’s most beloved and iconic brands we need to carefully balance the journey towards more non-HFSS products alongside the need to meet the expectations of our consumers we want to ensure we don’t compromise on taste or quality. This remains a complex challenge for the industry and one which requires ongoing partnership with government.”​

Drinking chocolate

Mondelēz also said that in 2023 it will further continue its journey to provide consumers with greater choice including through offering products with improved nutritional profiles by reformulating its Cadbury Drinking Chocolate and Cadbury Instant Hot Chocolate packs to make them non-HFSS.

This move complements the existing non-HFSS products it already offers in the category including Bournville Cocoa Cadbury Highlights Milk Choc Highlights Bournville Green & Blacks Cocoa and Green & Blacks Hot Chocolate.

Biscuits

The launch also includes new line extension of belVita Soft Bakes Apricot Filled and a new sub-range belVita Fruit Crunch Range with Apple & Pear 30% less sugar and 70% less saturated fat and Raisin & Currant 70% less saturated fat.

Much of the R&D work has been carried out at the company’s Bournville and Reading facilities which are home to two of 15 global research hubs Mondelēz International runs worldwide.

In a statement it said the business is reformulating products where possible to give consumers a broad portfolio of choice for different needs and occasions.

“However reformulating chocolate is very difficult given the role that sugar plays in the product contributing to the texture bulk and structure as well as the taste. Chocolate formulation is also prescribed by statute which prohibits the use of starch artificial sweeteners polyols and other sugar replacers​” Mondelēz explained.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2RidXNpbmVzc25ld3MubmV0L2FydGljbGVzLzIxODkzLW1lZXQtdGhlLXRoaW5rLXRhbmstcGFpcmluZy1icmFuZHMtd2l0aC10aGUtd29ybGRzLXNtYXJ0ZXN0LW1pbmRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet the think tank pairing brands with the world's smartest minds,"NEW YORK — A think tank is tapping high IQ individuals to develop new products for brands across a range of industries. ProdigyWorks offers access to a network of Mensa International members helping companies like Mondelez International The Coca-Cola Co. Dunkin’ and more accelerate their innovation efforts and stay ahead of the competition.

“Companies come to us with a range of developed problems or issues” said Ted Curtin chief marketing and innovation officer at ProdigyWorks. “It can be very specific where they know exactly what they need help with. Others may come to us and say ‘We’re losing market share’ or ‘We see this trend happening and we want to get in front of it.’”

The think tank works with clients to pin down a goal then looks to its network of nearly 2000 Mensa members to form a small panel of “prodigies.” Potential panelists are vetted with an audition question to determine if they’re the right fit for a specific challenge.

The result is a diverse group of 15 to 20 high IQ individuals with any number of different backgrounds. A panel could span Nobel prize-winning physicists and NASA scientists to farmers teachers professional athletes nurses and more.

“Companies can end up with a panel that doesn’t look anything like them” Mr. Curtin said. “That’s intentional. If a panel looks just like you couldn’t you do it yourself? We find cool combinations of individuals who think differently than most people. They connect the dots where most people can’t.”

After establishing a goal and assembling a team ProdigyWorks brings the panelists into a secure online portal and presents them with the challenge. What follows is two weeks of around-the-clock collaborative ideation.

“This isn’t an afternoon brainstorm” Mr. Curtin said. “They’ve got the portal on their mobile device and on their computer. Whether they’re walking their dog cooking dinner or it’s the middle of the night they’re able to input an idea that everyone else can see.”

The creative sparks fly from there. Clients help steer the panel during the two-week ideation period ranking ideas and concepts to create a feedback loop with the prodigies. Panelists are provided a limited amount of data to help guide their thinking.

ProdigyWorks takes insights and research from the brand team and curates only a small segment of it for the prodigies.

“We don’t want to burden them with the same knowledge and biases the client has but you need some boundaries and guardrails” Mr. Curtin said. “We give them just enough to run free but in the right direction.”

ProdigyWorks in April was acquired by RTI research. Data from the market research company helps validate concepts sparked by the extended brainstorms.

In-market successes

The process stands in stark contrast to the rigid way most companies operate but its playful and organic structure yields real results Mr. Curtin said. Around 90% of challenges result in a new product being introduced to market.

“There’s a reason we’ve worked with all of these companies across different industries and there’s a reason they keep coming back to refill their pipeline” Mr. Curtin said. “The process works if you trust it.”

He pointed to a partnership with Mondelez International as an example. The company asked ProdigyWorks for help creating innovations that could keep the Oreo brand fresh and fun for its core consumers. The panel — comprised of a food blogger professional chefs a millennial cupcake entrepreneur a former marketing executive a candy maker a culinary director and a molecular gastronomer — delivered more than 500 ideas in two weeks.

Those initial ideas were culled down to 220 concepts that were further refined to 30 viable options. Fourteen concepts advanced into testing and several new varieties of the classic sandwich cookie ended up on grocery store shelves. Current in-market successes include Oreo cinnamon bun Oreo blueberry pie and Oreo firework.

A panel featuring a party planner a Lego designer a comic book writer and more helped The Topps Company Inc. develop new concepts for the Juicy Drop and Push Pop brands. The ideation session led to Push Pop gummy roll the brand’s first foray into the gummy category and Juicy Drop re-mix an interactive treat featuring sweet and sour candy in a portable container.

Other successes include a partnership with Chili's. The Brinker International-owned restaurant chain tasked ProdigyWorks with refreshing its menu to appeal to millennials without alienating baby boomers its core customer base. Prodigies including food bloggers marketers and more created nearly 500 new concepts.

After evaluation testing and development five of the panel’s Fresh Mex recommendations were added to the Chili’s menu. One-in-four guests now order an entree identified by ProdigyWorks.

The think tank’s record of success underscores the critical role innovation plays in a rapidly changing marketplace Mr. Curtin said.

“Innovation is often a box-check or an afterthought” he said. “Whether you’re tapping into ProdigyWorks going to an agency or focusing internally it’s important to have innovation at the forefront. It shouldn’t be this occasional thing that blips onto the radar.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJha2luZ2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy81NzAwOC1iZWx2aXRhLW5hbWVkLWZhc3Rlc3QtZ3Jvd2luZy1mb29kLWJyYW5kLWluLXRoZS13b3JsZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BelVita named fastest growing food brand in the world,"LONDON —Mondelez International Inc.’s belVita brand was ranked as the fastest growing food brand globally in “Food & Drink 2022” a report that highlights the top performing global food and beverage brands as measured by consultancy company Brand Finance.

Coming in second for growth was China-based flavoring brand Haitian up 55% with McCormick & Co. in third up 54%.

Vevey Switzerland-based Nestle SA came in first again as the world’s most valuable brand valued at $20.8 billion up from $19.4 billion in 2021 and worth nearly twice as much as the second-place company China-based dairy brand Yili Group which was valued at $10.6 billion.

“Nestle credits their decentralized structure as the reason for its agility in responding to changes in consumer needs customer demands and supply chain challenges which is correlated with its brand value growth” Brand Finance said.

In addition Nestle’s investments in digital transformation and long-term brand strategy have helped it stay in the top position according to the company.

Yili specializes in high-status dairy products which have seen a surge in the past year from an increased perception of immunity building and general health benefits. Coming in third was Lay’s which is part of Purchase NY-based PepsiCo Inc. According to the report Lay’s increased its value by 31% since 2021 up to $8.6 billion. Many consumers underwent a shift in snacking habits during the COVID-19 pandemic which Lay’s was able to capitalize on via an enhanced digital presence.

“People are returning to the brands they love they are hungry for Nestle Yili and Lay’s” said Savio D’Souza head of EMEA consulting at Brand Finance. “Food brand values are back above pre-pandemic levels.”

Beyond growth and value Brand Finance also calculates brand strength based on metrics such as marketing investments stakeholder equity and business performance. Using market research data from more than 100000 respondents in over 35 countries and compliant with international evaluation standard ISO 20671 Brand Finance ranked Hershey’s as the world’s strongest food brand in 2022. Hershey’s score of a Brand Strength Index (BSI) at 89.8 and AAA+ brand rating moved the brand up from its second-place position last year.

“The mass-market American chocolate brand has proven that despite challenging conditions and disruptions worldwide it is more than able to respond to these with confidence and it has delivered another year of very strong performance” Brand Finance said.

Coming in second for strongest brand was PepsiCo’s Quaker Oats Co. with a BSI score of 89.2 and a AAA brand rating. Frito-Lay’s Doritos brand also part of PepsiCo ranked third with an 88.3 BSI and AAA brand rating.

On the non-alcoholic beverage front Coca-Cola earned the top spot for most valuable global brand at $35.4 billion according to Brand Finance.

“Coca-Cola consumption patterns were disrupted by the pandemic with a substantial reduction in social gatherings in many parts of the world” Brand Finance said. “Brand changes made by Coca-Cola during the pandemic such as the acceleration of its business transformation model to reduce sugar in its drink offerings and improve environmental sustainability in packaging and recycling are likely to have an ongoing effect on its brand value.”

Coca-Cola also came in first for non-alcoholic beverage brand strength with a 93.3 BSI and AAA+ rating.

PepsiCo came in second for both brand value — up 12% to $20.7 billion — and brand strength — with a 90.1 BSI and AAA+ rating.

“As pandemic restrictions recede in the rear-view mirror many non-alcoholic brand values are surging” Mr. D’Souza said. “People are once again able to easily get together for a Coke a Pepsi a coffee or cup of tea. This is good for consumers and good for brand values in this sector of the economy.”

Coca-Cola’s Monster Unilever PLC’s Lipton and PepsiCo’s Gatorade brands were the top three fastest growing beverage brands this year. Monster’s value was up 29% to $6.3 billion Lipton’s value was up 27% to $3.2 billion and Gatorade’s value was up 26% to $5.3 billion.

“During the pandemic many consumers would have likely experienced an increase in health and wellness consciousness along with the need to stay energized” Brand Finance said. “Consumers during this period experienced the restrictions of having to consume their drinks at home and not at their favorite restaurants or usual morning coffee shops most likely also saw this as an opportunity to increase their consumption in a more affordable manner.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3JldGFpbC1jb25zdW1lci90cmVlaG91c2UtZm9vZHMtc2VsbC1wYXJ0LWl0cy1tZWFsLXByZXAtYnVzaW5lc3MtOTUwLW1pbGxpb24tMjAyMi0wOC0xMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TreeHouse Foods to sell part of meal prep business for $950 million,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', ConnectionResetError(10054, 'An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host', None, 10054, None)) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3JldGFpbC1jb25zdW1lci90cmVlaG91c2UtZm9vZHMtc2VsbC1wYXJ0LWl0cy1tZWFsLXByZXAtYnVzaW5lc3MtOTUwLW1pbGxpb24tMjAyMi0wOC0xMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyZW5kaHVudGVyLmNvbS90cmVuZHMvdG9ibGVyb25lLWdvbGRlbtIBN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyZW5kaHVudGVyLmNvbS9hbXAvdHJlbmRzL3RvYmxlcm9uZS1nb2xkZW4?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gilded Caramel Chocolate Bars,"Toblerone Golden Offers a Sweet Textural Experience

So what do we know about the launch so far - and the further direction the company's alcohol strategy could take?

CANarchy springboard

Monster started its alcohol journey with the acquisition of CANarchy Craft Beer Collective​ – a craft beer and hard seltzer company – for $330m in January this year.

The acquisition brought key brands such as Cigar City (Jai Alai IPA and Florida Man IPA) Oskar Blues (Dale’s Pale Ale and Wild Basin Hard Seltzer) Deep Ellum (Dallas Blonde and Deep Ellum IPA) Perrin Brewing (Black Ale) Squatters (Hop Rising Double IPA and Juicy IPA) and Wasatch (Apricot Hefeweizen) into the Monster beverage portfolio.

Net sales for Monster’s Alcohol Brands segment which is comprised of the various craft beers and hard seltzers purchased as part of the CANarchy transaction on February 17 2022 were $32.4m for Q2 2022 (this being Monster's first full quarter in alcohol).

Monster labelled this acquisition as its ‘springboard to enter the alcoholic beverage sector’​ gaining a fully in-place infrastructure including people distribution and licenses along with alcoholic beverage development expertise and manufacturing capabilities in the industry.

Less than a year later the launch of The Beast Unleashed is set to follow. While Monster has revealed few details about drink's flavors look or target audience Sacks says it ‘will leverage Monster’s brand equity while carving out its own unique space in the beverage alcohol sector and will be distinguishable from the many hard seltzer brands that have become so ubiquitous over the last several years’.​

There will be four flavors in the line: as of yet unrevealed but 'full-bodied bold flavors' taking their inspiration from Monster’s ‘well-known and popular flavor profiles’ (of which Monster has nearing 40: ranging from a variety of tropical punch style flavors through to coffee/chocolate).

The drink will initially be offered in 16 oz single-serve cans as well as in a 12 can variety pack with 12 oz sleek cans.

The Beast Unleashed will be launched through beer distributors in the US in state-by-state phases starting at the end of the year. Monster aims for the drink to have national distribution by the end of 2023.

'Our alcohol innovation pipeline is robust'

But past the launch of The Beast Unleashed Sacks promises a long-term strategy in alcohol with several other alcoholic beverages in the works.

This year the company has filed for a raft of trademarks in the alcoholic beverage category: including Juice Monster Spiked Hard Juice Monster Khaotic Dragon Tea Eden Apple Aussie Style Lemonade and Pacific Punch: suggesting the company is considering both new brands and line extensions.

“​Our alcohol innovation pipeline is robust with a number of additional innovative product lines currently under development”​ said Sacks in last week’s earnings call. “We look forward to sharing news of such additional alcohol beverage products at a later date.” ​

The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo have both launched into RTD alcohol (more on this below...) through tie-ups with alcohol beverage companies who boast the appropriate know-how in the alcohol beverage sector: knowing this can differ enormously from soft drinks from regulatory processes to distribution set-ups.

Monster however has the infrastructure of its CANarchy acquisition as well as the option acquire other players in alcohol or create partnerships with alcohol beverage players.

From soft drinks to RTD alcohol

Monster’s move into alcoholic beverages is just the latest in a series of plays by soft drinks companies into alcohol: more precisely the booming RTD segment.

Hard Mtn Dew

PepsiCo launched Hard Mtn Dew in February year in partnership with The Boston Beer Company.

The 5% ABV is caffeine-free with zero added sugar and 100 calories per serving with 'new differentiated graphics' to highlight the hard proposition.

It comes in four flavors: Original Baja Blast Black Cherry and Watermelon.

(Monster's drink will come in at a higher 6% ABV; but expect similarly bold designs to tie in with the company's branding. Monster also appears to appreciate the value of zero sugar options given the upcoming launch of Monster Energy Zero Sugar​ back over in the non-alcoholic category at the end of this year.)

Carbonated soft drink Mtn Dew is one of PepsiCo’s top beverage brands: which has been pushing into energy with caffeinated Mtn Dew Rise Energy (launched in March) and Mtn Dew Amp Game Fuel (launched in 2018).

In the case of Hard Mtn Dew PepsiCo has licensed the brand to Boston Beer which is producing the product while PepsiCo has set up a new entity - Blue Cloud Distribution - for the wholesale operations including sales distribution and merchandising.

Speaking in last month's earnings call PepsiCo CEO Ramon L. Laguarta said the company is positive about the potential of the product after the first few months - as well as the wider potential to continue developing in the category.

Another high-profile move into alcohol is that of The Coca-Cola Company: which launched Topo Chico Hard Seltzer​​​ last year in partnership with Molson Coors (in the US Molson Coors takes on responsibility for the manufacture marketing and distribution of the drink).

The company described the launch as a ‘natural evolution’ of its premium Mexican water brand Topo Chico: taking the non-alcoholic brand smoothly into the alcohol category thanks to the alcohol know-how of Molson Coors. Its hard seltzer comes in at 4.7% ABV (again Monster’s 6% ABV will be considerably higher).

And of course as a soft drink company any growth in the alcohol category is incremental with most hard seltzer fans migrating to the category from beer.

Coca-Cola has also launched the drink outside of the US: in fact using Latin America as an early test market and launching in Europe slightly ahead of the US thanks to a simpler distribution system.

Coca-Cola is now building on its moves into alcohol with an alcoholic version of Fresca​​​ this year via a collaboration with Constellation Brands. This will see the zero-calorie grapefruit citrus-flavored soft drink and cocktail mixer – currently the fastest-growing trademark in The Coca-Cola Company’s US soft drink portfolio – launch a line of full-flavored spirit-based RTDs.

In this instance it sees Fresca Mixed appealing to consumers searching for ‘fuller-flavored experiences’ and higher-quality RTD cocktails to bridge the space between refreshing hard seltzers and bar cocktails.

In a similar arrangement as with Molson Coors on Topo Chico Constellation Brands is responsible for producing marketing and distributing Fresca mixed: drawing on its distilled manufacturing and operational capabilities and national distilled distribution network with access to retailers in this category.

And next up will be the launch of a Jack & Coke RTD canned cocktail:​ delivered via a partnership between Coca-Cola and Brown-Forman.

The 5% ABV drink will launch in Mexico at the end of the year in anticipation of a global rollout.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL2VuZXJneS1kcmlua3MtbG93ZXN0LXF1YWxpdHktaW5ncmVkaWVudHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,8 Energy Drinks with the Lowest Quality Ingredients,"We hate to be the bearer of bad news but energy drinks are not very good for your health. According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health these beverages can have myriad negative health effects including ""heart rhythm disturbances and increases in heart rate and blood pressure… [and] anxiety sleep problems digestive problems and dehydration."" Often loaded with caffeine and sugar as well as ingredients like guarana (a source of additional caffeine) and taurine which can cause blood pressure issues for some people per Web MD.

Like almost anything if they're consumed only on occasion—and not at a time of day when they will affect sleep and not mixed with alcohol which can cause a raft of other problems—energy drinks are not that big of a deal. But if you do choose to imbibe the occasional energy drink you may want to eschew the eight we're covering here today because they are made with low-quality ingredients.

Full Throttle

The Original Full Throttle energy drink is one of the least healthy and cheaply made options out there. A 16-ounce can is simply packed with sugar: One serving contains a staggering 58 grams which is twice as much sugar as an adult woman should have in an entire day and 22 more grams than an adult man should have via Harvard Health.

Rockstar

When you have no idea what most of the ingredients in food or beverage are it's probably a good idea to skip it. In the case of Rockstar the eighth and ninth ingredients are both preservatives and 10 of the 13 remaining ingredients will mystify almost anyone who is not an actual food scientist.

Monster

Monster Energy is packed with almost as much sugar as Full Throttle (it has 54 grams to Full Throttle's 58) and 160 milligrams of caffeine which is more than all but the strongest cup of coffee. It's also loaded with preservatives and chemicals like D-Glucuronolactone and Sucralose.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Mountain Dew Game Fuel

This beverage may position itself as an energy and acuity supplement designed for the modern gamer but it's really just a soda loaded up with extra artificial ingredients. The first few ingredients of this drink are the same as a basic Mountain Dew soda but then according to Pepsico Beverage Facts it's packed with things like sucrose aceto isobutyrate an artificial food emulsifier per Live Strong.

NOS

NOS an energy drink made by the Coca-Cola Company features a load of high fructose corn syrup two kinds of artificial color three kinds of preservatives and frankly no ingredient of any redeeming value. It's also packed with 220 calories per can which is another reason to avoid it.

Rip It

With all due respect to members (or veterans of) the USMC of whom Rip It is a favorite this is a cheaper energy drink because it is a cheaply made energy drink. Rip It is widely distributed to members of the armed forces and is often sold stateside for only a dollar a can per Thrillist which is very inexpensive for an energy drink indeed. We don't mind low prices but in this case that translates to cheap ingredients.

C4

With its proprietary ""Carnosyn® Beta-Alanine"" (which is supposed to help with muscle fatigue and strength building) aside C4 Energy Drink is mostly filled with cheap ingredients. These include things like citric acid potassium sorbate (that's a preservative) sucralose (an artificial sugar replacement) and acesulfame potassium (that's another fake sweetener).

Coca-Cola is the most valuable brand globally in the non-alcoholic drinks sector at US$35.4 billion

Coca-Cola (brand value up 7% to US$35.4 billion) is the world’s most valuable brand in the non-alcoholic drinks sector according to a new report from leading brand valuation consultancy Brand Finance. The iconic and world-leading drinks brand is rejuvenating its brand offering to meet consumer and regulatory demand for low sugar content beverages. Formerly famous for its sugary sweet flavour the Coca-Cola brand now offers many zero sugar products to remain relevant in a competitive industry.

Every year leading brand valuation consultancy Brand Finance puts 5000 of the world’s biggest brands to the test and publishes around 100 reports ranking brands across all sectors and countries. The top 25 most valuable and strongest non-alcoholic drinks brands are included in the annual Brand Finance Non-Alcoholic Drinks 25 ranking.

Coca-Cola consumption patterns were disrupted by the pandemic with a substantial reduction in social gatherings in many parts of the world. Brand changes made by Coca-Cola during the pandemic such as the acceleration of its business transformation model to reduce sugar in its drink offerings and improve environmental sustainability in packaging and recycling are likely to have an ongoing effect on its brand value. The brand’s innovative ‘Emerging Stronger’ strategy aims to make Coca-Cola an integral part of people celebrating the return of more shared social experiences while also focusing the company’s efforts on a smaller number of sub-brands.

Savio D’Souza Head of EMEA Consulting Brand Finance commented:

“As pandemic restrictions recede in the rear-view mirror many non-alcoholic brand values are surging. People are once again able to easily get together for a Coke a Pepsi a coffee or cup of tea. This is good for consumers and good for brand values in this sector of the economy.”

Coca-Cola is also the strongest soft drinks brand with elite AAA+ rating

In addition to brand value Brand Finance determines the relative strength of brands through a balanced scorecard of metrics evaluating marketing investment stakeholder equity and business performance. Compliant with ISO 20671 Brand Finance’s assessment of stakeholder equity incorporates original market research data from over 100000 respondents in more than 35 countries and across nearly 30 sectors.

Not only is Coca-Cola the most valuable brand in the ranking but it is also the strongest brand with a Brand Strength Index (BSI) score of 93.3 out of 100 and a corresponding elite AAA+ brand rating. Coca-Cola has created an extremely strong brand awareness across the world with consumers strongly associating the brand with celebrations and positive feelings.

Pepsi remain in second place in both brand value and brand strength rankings

Pepsi (brand value up 12% to US$20.7 billion) has retained its position as the second most valuable and second-strongest brand in the non-alcoholic drinks sector with the evolution of its strategy one that places sustainability and human capital at the centre of how it creates growth and value. The second strongest brand in the non-alcoholic drinks ranking is Pepsi with a Brand Strength Index (BSI) score of 90.1 out of 100 and a corresponding AAA+ rating. Pepsi also acknowledges a new business reality whereby consumers are becoming more interested in the future of the planet and society.

Monster Lipton and Gatorade are fastest growing brands this year

Monster (brand value up 29% to US$6.3 billion) Lipton (brand value up 27% to US$3.2 billion) and Gatorade (brand value up 26% to US$5.3 billion) were the three fastest-growing brands in the non-alcoholic drinks sector this year with each brand growing by just under a third as COVID restrictions have reduced.

During the pandemic many consumers would have likely experienced an increase in health and wellness consciousness along with the need to stay energised. It is therefore not too surprising that energy drinks Monster and Gatorade saw increases in brand values of 29% and 26% respectively.

Certain regions in the US and Europe also experienced record-breaking high temperatures during various stages of pandemic induced lockdowns and this may also have played a part in the high demand for these brands.

Notably Monster (brand value increase of 29%) has attributed its success in the market to its unique packaging and its belief in the need to constantly review it based on new guidelines. On the other hand Gatorade (brand value increase of 26%) has considered changes to its packaging more cautiously with that remaining somewhat consistent over the years.

Consumers during this period experienced the restrictions of having to consume their drinks at home and not at their favourite restaurants or usual morning coffee shops most likely also saw this as an opportunity to increase their consumption in a more affordable manner. Fine tea brand Lipton increased in its brand value by 27% the second highest recorded in the ranking and luxury coffee pod manufacturer Nespresso who recently launched its Nespresso editions digital engagement platform to bring inspirational moments to customers enjoying their coffee at home also increased by 13% in this category.

It can be easy to reach for these popular beverages when you’re feeling like an afternoon pick-me-up but specialists urge you to think twice as it could severely affect your heart health over time.

Hannah Drake a spokesperson for the Heart Foundation has responded to a viral TikTok from a user claiming he developed early onset heart disease after drinking energy drinks everyday for two years.

“People want to know is this real? Can it actually happen?” she said in the clip which has now been viewed over 3.6 million times. “I hate to be the bearer of bad news but yes.”

The consumption of energy drinks has been linked to high blood pressure irregular heart rates and stroke among other health conditions according to Drake.

“A specific example is atrial fibrillation which is a type of arrhythmia. It can lead to blood clots and increase your risk of stroke and heart failure” she explained in the TikTok.

Drake explained that the content of energy drinks are largely considered dietary supplements which means their ingredients are not preemptively screened by the US Food and Drug Association. And while the FDA does put a cap on what they consider a safe limit to caffeine consumption — 400 milligrams or less per serving — it’s hard to know exactly how much caffeine is actually being consumed in energy drinks.

“Discussing caffeine and energy drinks is difficult because there is such a wide range of caffeine content as well as serving sizes and additional ingredients” she said with reference to a 2016 study on caffeine content in energy drinks. “There have even been discrepancies regarding the amount of caffeine that’s listed on an energy drink and the amount of caffeine that the energy drink actually contained.”

Some brands are known to push caffeine content to the limit at a range of 80 milligrams to over 315 milligrams per serving. But it’s some of the other unregulated ingredients added to amplify the effects of caffeine that give Drake pause.

“Some energy drinks make it very easy to consume more caffeine than intended” she explained which may exacerbate underlying heart conditions.

In 2021 the American Heart Association reported that approximately 20% of all heart attacks in the US are “silent” — meaning the person might not even know that they’re having a heart attack.

“But the damage to their heart is still done” she continued. “And they’re left even more vulnerable to having a second heart attack. So there are plenty of people who could be at risk and might not even know it.”

Viewers were shocked by Drake’s PSA with some swearing off their daily energy drink habit. Others shared similar anecdotes to the viral TikTok that inspired the discussion.

“A cardiologist I worked with called it ‘cardiac death in a can’. I never drank an energy drink after that” one wrote.

“I used to drink 3 Red Bulls a day. I now have heart issues as well” another commiserated.

“Worked with a guy that drank 3 or 4 a shift… Died of a heart attack at 26” read one sobering comment.

Your energy drink habit could be harming your heart. @ theheartfoundation

It’s important to remember energy drinks are not a substitution for food Drake addd reminding people to always talk to your doctor about your personal health as well as your family health history.

“You’re never too young and it’s never too late to start living a more heart healthy lifestyle” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZmluYW5jZS9uZXdzL2NvY2EtY29sYS1oYmMtZmxhZ3Mtb25lLTA2MDM0MDYzMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coca-Cola HBC flags one-time $195 million hit from Russian operations,"Coca-Cola bottles are seen on sale in central St. Petersburg

By Amna Karimi

(Reuters) -Coca-Cola HBC AG said on Thursday it took a one-time hit of 190 million euros ($195.4 million) in the first half from costs related to its Russian business after it stopped selling Coke and other Coca-Cola Co products in the country.

The soft drinks bottler also reinstated its forecast for the year expecting annual comparable operating profit between 740 million and 820 million euros above market expectations.

Its shares rose 6% to 2100 pence.

HBC is one of Coca-Cola's many bottlers worldwide and holds local Coca-Cola franchises to bottle and sell drinks produced by the U.S. beverage giant. Coca-Cola holds a more than 20% stake in HBC.

Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co in March joined an exodus of companies from Russia in the wake of the Ukraine invasion which Moscow terms a ""special military operation"".

HBC said it has depleted its stock and stopped producing and selling Coca-Cola products in Russia once its largest market and would now have a smaller presence there.

Chief Executive Officer Zoran Bogdanovic told Reuters that local brands like Dobry Rich and Moya Semya remain profitable and are self-sufficient as it does not partner with Coca-Cola Co for any of its sales in the Russian market.

HBC's net sales revenue grew nearly 30% for the six months to July 1 beating a company-compiled consensus of analysts estimate of 3.95 billion euros as emerging markets remained strong. Comparable operating profit also beat expectations but net profit came in below estimates due to the charge in the first half.

It expects financial charges of about 82 million euros in the second-half related to its Russian operations.

Bogdanovic said the company has had to lay off employees in Russia as it downsized its business there.

Switzerland-headquartered HBC's diverse portfolio ranges from alcoholic beverages such as The Macallan and Jack Daniel's to carbonated drinks Sprite and Monster Energy to Bambi biscuits and wafers.

growing presence in extended warranty service and replacement plans for consumer electronics

and appliances offered through major retailers its own repair shop network and a remote technician

network (Retail and Direct segment). In both segments a growing share of Asurion’s revenue comes

from comprehensive technical support bundled with other product offerings. Asurion has a record

of efficient operations good customer service healthy profit margins and broad access to debt and

equity financing.

Credit challenges for Asurion include its business concentrations among leading wireless carriers

underscored by the recent loss of an account following a merger of carriers foreign exchange risk

associated with its large Japanese business and incremental costs and uncertainty related to its

expanded product offerings. Asurion also has a record of borrowing substantial sums from time to

time to help fund payments to shareholders.

The loss of a major carrier account in late 2021 along with other charges and investments has

caused Asurion’s run-rate EBITDA to decline by a double-digit percentage in 2022 versus 2021. In

response Asurion is reducing its cost structure (mainly through a modest staff reduction) shifting

some resources toward new products and services and reducing its debt by $535 million as part of

the pending transaction.

Giving effect to the pending transaction Moody’s estimates that Asurion will have a pro forma debt-

to-EBITDA ratio of about 6.5x (EBITDA - capex) interest coverage of 2.5x-3.0x and a free-cash-

flow-to-debt ratio in the mid-single digits. These pro forma metrics incorporate Moody's adjustments

for operating leases noncontrolling interest expense and foreign exchange hedging. The rating

agency expects Asurion to return to EBITDA growth and reduce its financial leverage in the year

ahead.

FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS

Factors that could lead to an upgrade of Asurion's ratings include (i) debt-to-EBITDA ratio

consistently below 5x (ii) (EBITDA - capex) coverage of interest exceeding 3.5x (iii) free-cash-flow-

to-debt ratio above 8% and (iv) EBITDA margin exceeding 25%.

Factors that could lead to a rating downgrade include: (i) debt-to-EBITDA ratio consistently above

6.5x (ii) (EBITDA - capex) coverage of interest below 2x (iii) free-cash-flow-to-debt ratio below 4%

(iv) EBITDA margins below 18% or (v) loss of another major carrier relationship.

Draft legislation released Tuesday addresses Budget 2022’s proposal to phase out access to the small business rate more gradually.

Currently access to the small business rate is proportionally reduced when a business has taxable capital of between $10 million and $15 million and ends completely at taxable capital of $15 million. With the legislation access will be fully phased out at $50 million instead.

The measure aims to help smaller businesses grow — though the passive income rules must still be contended with as a company saves for future expansion. (The small business deduction limit starts to be reduced at investment income above $50000 and hits zero at $150000.)

The feds “may have bumped up the capital item but what they really needed to do was have a corresponding bump in the passive income” said Keith MacIntyre tax partner with Grant Thornton LLP in Halifax.

The amendment applies to taxation years that begin on or after April 7 (budget day).

Tuesday’s draft legislation also targets the use of foreign corporations to avoid paying the additional refundable corporate income tax that CCPCs would otherwise pay on investment income.

To no longer be considered a CCPC a corporation could move to a foreign low-tax jurisdiction use a foreign shell company or move passive portfolios to an offshore corporation the budget said.

An anticipated large gain ahead of a business sale at retirement — $50 million say — could motivate such planning because not all the money would need to be taken out of the corporation MacIntyre said. Plus the planning cost wouldn’t be prohibitive for large transactions he said.

With the new legislation planning that results in non-CCPC status will be a reportable transaction so the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) can assess whether the planning is appropriate or whether the corporation is a “substantive CCPC” — factually or legally controlled by one or more Canadian residents.

Not only is the new measure applicable on a go-ahead basis but it could affect those who did this planning previously: the CRA stated it would look at previous transactions with an eye to anti-avoidance.

“What they’re really saying is they don’t like this [planning] at all” MacIntyre said.

For anyone with a non-CCPC who may be concerned he suggested considering whether the CRA would challenge the planning whether that challenge was likely to be successful and how much defending oneself against a challenge would cost. Risk is increased when changes are made to a corporation ahead of a transaction he said.

Based on reportable transactions and CRA commentary regarding past transactions “clearly they have this planning in their sights” MacIntyre said.

The “substantive CCPC” definition applies to taxation years that end on or after April 7 2022. According to the federal budget the measure will increase federal revenues by $4.2 billion over five years.",,,,,,,,,

On August 5 Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas lowered the firm’s price target on Fisker shares from $15 to $10 while downgrading the rating from Overweight to Equalweight.

Fisker CEO posted Wednesday on his Instagram account a screenshot from Fisker’s Q2 Financial results asking the analyst for a correction in his latest report regarding “modeling error & assumptions” about the company.

“Mr. Adam Jonas @morgan.stanley when are u going to correct ur team’s recent research report modeling error & assumptions about @fiskerinc” Henrik Fisker wrote.

Credit: Fisker

Last week Jonas said the EV maker is “in a situation where access to capital in the next 6 months would be highly deterministic to the company’s fundamental performance” estimating the need to raise between $0.5 billion and $1 billion by early 2023.

“We covered largely in-line results and a reiterated start of production (SOP) and cash burn guide in our reaction note. In this note we update our earnings forecasts and price target to reflect the need for substantial outside capital (we estimate between $500mm and $1bn by early next year) in order to fund the ramp of the Ocean as well as development/capex related to other products we have given Fisker credit for in our forecasts” the analyst said.

In addition the analyst warned of the continuing macro and geopolitical risk including the European gas shortage risk elevating the near-term execution risk considering Fisker‘s vehicles will be produced in Gratz Austria.

“While the supply chain situation may be improving and the company may be benefiting from easing material costs and a weak Euro we believe the company is in the situation where access to capital in the next 6 months would be highly deterministic to the company’s fundamental performance. Continuing macro and geopolitical risk compounded by European gas shortage risk (100% of Fisker’s production is in Austria) elevates the near term execution risk”.

“As such we now assume FSR raises $1bn in 4Q22 at the current share price of $10/share compared to a $1.5bn debt raise in FY23 that we modeled previously creating substantial dilution. This coupled with a more modest outlook for volume through 2030 reduces our price target to $10 (vs. $15 previously) and rating to EW vs. OW previously.”

On August 3 Fisker reported its second quarter earnings results where it confirmed the sold-out of the 5000 units special units for the Ocean model amid a non-refundable $5000 reservation.

The company said it has over $850 million of cash and cash equivalents reflecting its “prudent liquidity management and is sufficient to fund the production launch of the Fisker Ocean in November 2022 and for additional vehicle development throughout 2022”.

“We are delighted to announce that the 5000 limited edition Fisker Ocean One pre-order units are completely sold out thanks to pioneering customers in all nine launch markets: Austria Canada Denmark France Germany Norway Sweden United Kingdom and the United States” Henrik Fisker Fisker CEO stated.

Earlier in the week Fisker CEO unveiled that the upcoming Ocean Model will bring streaming apps like Youtube Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video but also the web browser Google Chrome.

The US-based company’s residential whole energy storage system the Franklin Home Power system debuted in January of this year and integrates its lithium iron phosphate “aPower” battery with its aGateX intelligent control system.

The 13.6 KWh battery is compatible with any PV inverter technology the company reports and it can connect with existing solar systems while scaling up to 15 units for a total of 204 KWh of capacity. In the event of a power failure its black start feature creates a micro-grid for the home.

With Franklin WH being added to Mosaic and GoodLeap’s Approved Vendor Lists (AVL) FranklinWH installers can now offer customers access to lower interest rates on energy storage systems. The two financing companies have provided more than $18 billion in loans combined for solar sustainable home improvements in the United States.

Their big idea: Break a world record.

And after coming across an article about students in San Diego setting a Guinness World Record in 2016 by creating the largest mosaic ever assembled from cereal boxes the pair had their record to break.

Kotcher 15 and Shiffman 16 decided they’d build their mosaic into the Ukrainian flag — and like the students in San Diego who used their project to raise awareness about homelessness — would aspire to also help their local community in the process.

“We thought it would be a fun way to bring everyone together as a community and support the people of Ukraine” Kotcher said.

The students also created a GoFundMe page to raise money for Razom a New York-based nonprofit Ukrainian-American human rights organization.

On Wednesday the boys and nearly two dozen other students from around the city who are part of the group Chicago Children United for Ukraine got together at the Wintrust Grand Banking Hall at 231 S. LaSalle St. to put their mosaic together. They completed the project Thursday.

The final mosaic measured by independent surveyors came out to 34 feet by 86 feet and required 4932 boxes of cereal.

Those measurements will be used by Guinness to rule on records for the largest packaged food mosaic and largest cardboard box mosaic though the process could take a week or more according to Ryder Shiffman’s mother Lara Shiffman.

To craft the mosaic the students used boxes of Rice Krispies and Corn Pops to represent the Ukrainian flag’s blue and yellow colors. The boxes were donated by Kellogg’s and will be regifted by the students to the Greater Chicago Food Depository on Friday.

“The Greater Chicago Food Depository thanks Kellogg’s for the donation and commends the Chicago Children United for Ukraine students for their philanthropic spirit” Sheila Creghin vice president of operations for the food bank said in a statement.

Shiffman said he felt confident that his group’s mosaic would grab the record noting that their project was larger in size and used more boxes than the one created by the San Diego students but said the record was really a secondary goal.

“It was nice being able to team up with my peers to pull off this mosaic and donate to different causes” Shiffman said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXN0b25jaHJvbmljbGUuY29tL25ld3MvaG91c3Rvbi10ZXhhcy90cmVuZGluZy9hcnRpY2xlL3dvcmxkLXJlY29yZHMtMTczNjQwNzIucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These 11 incredible and bizarre world records were set in Houston,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/trending/article/world-records-17364072.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXN0b25jaHJvbmljbGUuY29tL25ld3MvaG91c3Rvbi10ZXhhcy90cmVuZGluZy9hcnRpY2xlL3dvcmxkLXJlY29yZHMtMTczNjQwNzIucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Actually with students in some parts of the state set to return to the classroom today it’d be more appropriate to call it “back-in-school” season.

After you wave goodbye to the kids at the bus stop or drop-off line take a minute to read about the people in Tallahassee who make Florida schools what they are — and remember every day is a school day if you learn something new.

Florida is the third-largest state and unlike many others its school districts are organized at the county level. That has led to the Sunshine State being home to some of the largest school districts in the country. Miami-Dade is the fifth-largest in the nation followed by Broward at No. 7 Hillsborough at No. 9 and Palm Beach at No. 12.

Each of those school districts — and several others — have their own lobbying team. Miami-Dade is represented by Ron Book Rana Brown and Kelly Mallette of Ronald L. Book P.A.; Michael Corcoran Jacqueline Corcoran Matt Blair Andrea Tovar and Will Rodriguez of Corcoran Partners; Thomas Cerra of Florida School Services; Eduardo Gonzalez and William McRea of Sun City Strategies; and Yolanda Cash Jackson and LaToya Sheals of Becker & Poliakoff.

Jackson and Sheals also represent Broward Schools as do Brian Ballard Katherine San Pedro and Stephanie Zauder of Ballard Partners. Hillsborough Schools meanwhile have contracted with Alan Suskey RJ Myers Amy Maguire and Jim Taylor of Shumaker Advisors Florida as well as John White of Catalyst Consulting Group.

When it comes to K-12 education there’s no more influential group than the Florida Education Association. The teacher union is not only the largest of its kind in the state but the largest union in the entire Southeast. FEA represents more than 150000 workers including teachers school staff higher education faculty and graduate assistants.

When FEA needs representation in the state Capitol it relies on Jonathan Kilman Carlos Cruz and Elnatan Rudolph of Converge Public Strategies as well as its in-house team which includes Catherine Schipman Boehme Tina Dunbar Stephanie Kunkel Chadwick Leonard Michael Monroe Alexis Montalvo Yale Olenick and Eric Riley.

One of the top issues in education today unfortunately is school safety. The Florida Department of Education has a division — the Office of Safe Schools — dedicated to school safety and the state has taken many steps in the wake of the Parkland shooting to ensure Florida public schools are.

One of those steps is a requirement that all public schools implement a mobile panic alert system. After the requirement also known as Alyssa’s Alert was signed into law in 2020 DOE approved eight vendors that provide such systems. They include AppArmor/Cutcom Software Ares Security Corporation AT&T Centegix Everbridge Intrado Motorola Solutions Raptor and 911 Cellular.

Each of those companies has had a Florida lobbying team at one point or another and a few of them still do —Everbridge is represented by Shawn Foster of Sunrise Consulting Group and Raptor Technologies is represented by Sheela VanHoose of The Southern Group.

AT&T’s and Motorola Solutions’ business in the Sunshine State extends far beyond panic alerts and they of course have lobbyists too. Motorola Solutions is represented by Ken Granger of Capital City Consulting while AT&T has nearly four dozen lobbyists. A non-exhaustive list of firms the telecom giant has on retainer: The Advocacy Group Ronald L. Book PA Flagler Strategies Converge Government Solutions Metz Husband & Daughton The Fiorentino Group Becker & Poliakoff The Mayernick Group and Liberty Partners.

On a lighter note the first day of school wouldn’t be the same without the annual back-to-school sales tax holiday. This year’s was two weeks long and was no doubt a boon for Florida brick and mortars which are represented by the Florida Retail Federation.

FRF relies on an in-house lobbying team but it also has a handful of contract lobbyists assisting it in Tallahassee. They include Angela Bonds and French Brown of Dean Mead as well as Jon Johnson and Darrick McGhee of Johnson & Blanton.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnRlbGxpZ2VudGNpby5jb20vbm9ydGgtYW1lcmljYS8yMDIyLzA4LzEwL2NvbHVtYmlhLWFuZC1tb250b3VyLWNvdW50aWVzLWpvaW4tbmV3LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zdGF0ZXdpZGUtcDI1LXJhZGlvLW5ldHdvcmsv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Columbia and Montour counties join new Pennsylvania Statewide P25 Radio Network – Intelligent CIO North America,"The Columbia and Montour Counties 9-1-1 Center operating as the East Central Emergency Network (ECEN) has announced its cutover to the Pennsylvania Statewide Radio Network (PA-STARNet) the commonwealth’s state-of-the-art Project 25 (P25) radio network for public safety and emergency response communications. The network was built and is maintained by Motorola Solutions which operates over 1100 standards-based public safety networks in North America.

“Our relationship with Motorola Solutions spans many years as we’ve worked to establish a modern affordable and comprehensive mission-critical radio network for emergency operations” said Jeremy Brown Director ECEN. “Our investment in land mobile radio paired with the dedication of our local teams – including our 9-1-1 team first responders Montrose Broadcasting (WPGM) and Capital Area Communications – has made it possible for us to join PA-STARNet in an efficient and cost-effective way so our communities can realize the benefits of more reliable and collaborative public safety communications.”

“The Columbia and Montour Counties 9-1-1 Center merger was one of the first in the commonwealth which saved the local taxpayers millions of dollars” said Ken Holdren Commissioner Montour County. “Broadening the partnership to include the PA-STARNet radio system continues this effort by enhancing the quality of service in the most cost-effective way.”

That coupled with 67 terminations suggests that either it’s the summer doldrums or the Western District of Texas/Waco reshuffling order is having an immediate impact on filings as would-be plaintiffs reassess venue choices—at least in the short term. Of the terminations a large chunk are IP Edge (per usual); the IPRs represent mostly defendants in litigation challenging claims asserted against them with a few notable exceptions. In the district courts a new Jeff Gross entity was the biggest filer with some other activity highlighted below. One entity Alidouble appears to have ties with both Israeli and Hong Kong-based predecessors-in-interests with Hong Kong-based Keystone Intellectual Property Management recorded.

Missed Serve: In what looks like capitalizing on a major procedural blunder semiconductor giant Trend Micro filed a declaratory judgment (DJ) action against Taasera Licensing LLC in the Northern District of Texas on at least nine patents that had previously been asserted—but not served—in the Eastern District of Texas’ Marshall division.

According to the complaint “On November 30 2021 Taasera filed suit in the Eastern District of Texas against Trend Micro Japan [….] Taasara has not served Trend Micro Japan. While Taasara did not name Trend Micro as a defendant in the Complaint Taasara’s allegations of infringement as to Trend Micro’s products which are sold in the United States by Trend Micro establish a justiciable case or controversy between Taasara and Trend Micro of sufficient immediacy and reality.”

The failure of service has opened the door for DJ jurisdiction elsewhere by other defendants if necessary which in an ostensibly high-stakes semiconductor litigation has put the would-be plaintiff on the back foot.

Gross Files Aggressive New Campaign Tests West Texas Order: With yet another new single-patent non-practicing entity (NPE) campaign from Jeffrey Gross Focus Global Solutions LLC the aggregator has sued HP Dell Solarwinds Extreme Networks Cisco and Broadcom. The suits were filed by Issac Rabicoff in the Western District of Texas and were assigned randomly; Dell went to Judge Montavlo in El Paso Broadcom went to Judge Pulliam in San Antonio and Cisco went to Senior Judge Ezra in San Antonio; all three were voluntarily dismissed unilaterally by Rabicoff less than a week later. HP was assigned to Judge Ezra as well and has yet to be dismissed; Extreme Networks was assigned to Chief Judge Orlando Garcia (also sitting in San Antonio) still pending; and Solar Winds was assigned to Judge David Counts III in Midland (also still pending). It’s unclear if this was meant more to test the random assignment or if the filings were made without considering the new regime and then quickly dismissed.

Buying the Farm: A western dispute between Farmers Edge and Farmobile LLC spilled into court this week on five patents. Per the complaint Kansas-based Farmobile LLC sued Manitoba-based Farmers Edge (whose US subsidiary is based in Minnesota) this week in Marshall in the Eastern District citing extensive sales employees and business operations in the state. Accused products include farm information recordation systems such as for example CanPlugs which are “installed in or on agricultural equipment” and are designed to “record and transmit data during a farming operation including real-time data generated by the agricultural equipment as well as the related FarmCommand software platform that the user may access to retrieve and/or view the recorded data using a mobile device such as a tablet or laptop computer.”

Deal volume here climbed 74 per cent to US$5.6 billion ($7.72 billion) in the three months to June 30 - a record level for a single quarter - as institutional investors piled in.

The report from MSCI Real Assets a part of index compiler MSCI showed investment across the region totalled US$45.1 billion a 24 per cent decline from the same quarter in 2021.

MSCI said this drop was led by a sharp fall in trades of individual properties which totalled only US$33.1 billion compared with an average of around US$40 billion a quarter for most of 2021.

""Singapore was the star in Asia-Pacific's gloomy second quarter"" said MSCI which based its report on sale and purchase data of office retail industrial hotel apartment and senior housing properties.

Demand for Singapore property was broad-based with Central Business District offices garnering most investment while shopping centres and hotels performed well too.

Overall transaction volume reached US$7.8 billion for the first half of 2022 in Singapore up 53 per cent year on year.

""Global investors have been the driving force behind Singapore's stellar showing this year"" MSCI noted.

Offices continued to be the most sought-after property type it added citing the sale of Income At Raffles at over $3600 per square foot.

Other key deals included Tanglin Shopping Centre Cross Street Exchange Westgate Tower and Twenty Anson.

Mr Benjamin Chow head of Asia real assets research at MSCI said: ""Commercial real estate investment in Singapore went quiet during each of the previous two downturns but 2022 has proven to be third time lucky with a record level of activity so far.

""While the broader regional slowdown has largely been attributable to fall-off in smaller deals Singapore's institutionally dominated market has shrugged off the macroeconomic headwinds.""",,,

Camping World Holdings Inc. Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc. and Deckers Outdoor Corp. saw impressive gains possibly reflecting family summer camping before the start of school and decreasing gas prices. Markets in general saw significant gains compared to previous months.

Here’s a look at what happened in July.

Tracking the Monthly OBJ Outdoor Index

Below is the OBJ Outdoor Index for July 2022. The Index shows how 28 public corporations—mostly parent companies of outdoor brands with a couple of retailers a ski resort giant and a trade show operator included as well—performed in the calendar month.

The chart includes the companies’ share prices at the close of the last business day of the previous month (June 30) their share price at the close of the last business day of the tracked month (July 29) and the percent change during that period. The OBJ Outdoor Index unlike other indices such as the Dow doesn’t use a market-cap weighting system.

Foreign companies’ shares are presented here in U.S. dollars and designated as OTC (over-the-counter) securities since they aren’t listed on U.S. stock exchanges. Two exceptions are Dometic Group AB and Fenix Outdoor International Group whose share prices can be found only on Nasdaq Stockholm and are represented as U.S. currency converted from the Swedish krona.

But when multiple insiders are buying like they did in the case of Veeco Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ:VECO) that sends out a positive message to the company's shareholders.

While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.

Veeco Instruments Insider Transactions Over The Last Year

In the last twelve months the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Independent Director Peter Simone sold US$175k worth of shares at a price of US$27.08 per share. While insider selling is a negative to us it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$20.99). So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.

Over the last year we can see that insiders have bought 12.50k shares worth US$259k. On the other hand they divested 8.35k shares for US$224k.

Backup storage is the physical hardware that houses the data copies made during a backup process. Storage solutions made specifically for backups are adaptive to rapid retrieval and regular updating of content.

Unlike cold storage or digital archiving solutions backup storage is used to house data for recovery in case of natural disasters or cyberthreats.

See below to learn all about the global backup storage market:

Backup storage features

Backup storage refers to a variety of data storage solutions that can be divided into two key categories depending on the storage location:

On-premises backup storage

On-premises backup or on-site backup is a common type used by large companies working in data-sensitive industries such as finance and insurance.

Instead of transporting data off-site for backup the storage servers are located somewhere within the vicinity of the main offices or remotely.

Multiple types of storage solutions can be used for on-premises backups such as hard disk drives (HDDs) tape drives and solid-state drives (SSDs) depending on the storage capacity.

Cloud-based backup storage

Cloud backup storage can be achieved by outsourcing the backup needs to a third-party service provider or by leasing private public or hybrid cloud space to manage for data backup purposes.

Data is sent to the cloud server where it can be accessed and recovered when needed.

The service provider is responsible for maintaining the cloud infrastructure. Choosing between public private and hybrid cloud can be influenced by the type of data stored and data management regulations.

AI and backup storage

On their own backup storage solutions are reliant on human guidance. Whether it’s the management of stored data or the scheduling of maintenance that doesn’t interfere with set update times.

By introducing machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) into the equation data backup solutions become more self-sufficient and automated. Not only will smarter backup storage solutions save time but they could also predict and prevent system failures.

“Automation has played a key role in managing data for a long time. … It then got a bit more sophisticated with things like automated discovery and protection of new workloads” says Simon Jelley a member of the Forbes Business Council.

“AI is also currently helping to predict hardware failures in backup storage devices and enable relevant hardware to be replaced before failure to avoid backup performance impact and recovery failures.”

Benefits of backup storage

Having a dedicated solution for backup storage is essential for data-driven companies that handle business and customer data.

Some benefits of data backup storage include:

Achieving regulatory compliance

Reducing on-site IT costs

Reducing the workload on IT teams

Enabling data recovery in emergencies

Mitigating the damages of ransomware and malware

Prompting customer trust

“Organizations that obtain data from their customers such as online stores or insurance agencies have a high risk and a huge responsibility to protect their consumers’ data” according to a post at Rewind.

“With the sudden rise in privacy regulations organizations have an added responsibility to secure their consumers’ data and protect it from loss or breach. Failure to do can result in heavy fines and penalties. In reality every organization should have a backup and recovery plan in place.”

Backup storage use cases

With the widespread demand for backup storage solutions providers are offering a variety of options for organizations:

Point Loma Nazarene University

Point Loma Nazarene University (PLNU) is a private liberal arts school located in San Diego. The university teaches over 60 different fields to its 3000 students.

PLNU had its own tape library and was storing all its critical data on-site. With its storage hardware becoming outdated the university sought a different solution for its infrastructure.

Working with Clumio PLNU diversified its data storage and backup system to include cloud backups on AWS and on-premises backups that can be both managed through the same software.

“The fact that we can unify our backup and retention policies across all of the various different technologies that we use is amazing. I am keenly looking out for the next thing that Clumio adds to the platform” says Joe Alcorn infrastructure manager PLNU.

“While one of our biggest concerns going in was budget we certainly had hoped to find a solution that provided more than just an economical solution.”

PLNU was able to save over 20% of data management costs restore a server within 30 minutes and protect three different data sources.

Woodward

Woodward is a designer manufacturer and provider of industrial control systems and their components. Based in Fort Collins Colorado its products include aircraft engines power generators mobile industrial equipment and industrial engines and turbines.

Woodward was struggling with slow backups and inconsistent data policies that resulted in gaps in its data protection. It also sought centralized management for its backup and disaster recovery.

Working with Commvault Woodward used Complete Data Protection for on-premises and AWS cloud enabling it to unify its backup and data management solutions across 25 locations.

“Our existing backup products were not meeting our needs. … Any restore requests that came in we just crossed our fingers and made a best effort at recovery” says Loren Leveque senior manager IT and system networking Woodward.

“Commvault to the rescue. Our long-standing backup and restore problems are now a thing of the past.”

With Commvault Woodward was able to save 10 hours a week on data administrative tasks cut SQL backup from 24 hours to 15 minutes and achieved over 70% data reduction using duplication.

IGZ

IGZ offers a range of SAP-assisted services and integration with the SAP software suite. Based in Brandenburg Germany it offers solutions for the optimization and management of complex processes in logistics production distribution and transportation.

IGZ works around the clock with its customers to ensure optimal working conditions for its solutions. This creates the need for a data storage and backup solution that can handle massive amounts of data incoming at all times.

Working with NetApp IGZ implemented an all-flash data storage system and used NetApp Snapshot for backup operating in two separate buildings with its four VMware ESX servers and 120 virtual machines (VMs).

“The NetApp concept of data fabric was the sweet spot. No other vendor could offer this kind of future outlook. It also convinced our management” says Matthias Schmidt team lead in system administration IGZ.

“I would always recommend that companies with similar needs use a solution from NetApp. With our current configuration we are ideally positioned for the coming years.”

Switching to NetApp IGZ achieved a 13 times higher IOPS rate gained 200% more storage capacity and shrunk its storage footprint by 85%.

Backup storage providers

Some of the leading providers of backup storage solutions and services in the market include:

CA Technologies

Dell Technologies

Oracle

NetApp

IBM

Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)

Microsoft

Commvault

Unitrends

According to recent findings from analytics company Apptopia 99 percent of the service’s users have never touched a single video game on the platform. If you’ve played any of their titles congratulations: You are the one percent.

Although perhaps not shocking this news is eyebrow-raising. Netflix lost some 970000 subscribers last quarter and it seems the company is unlikely to recoup them by recruiting gamers. The stats obtained by CNBC via Apptopia reveal that games on the platform have an average of 1.7 million daily users—a fraction of Netflix’s subscriber base of 221 million. The total number of downloads for those games is about 23.3 million.

Tech giants dipping into gaming is hardly new. Amazon and Google have tried their hand by hiring all-star talent and working on in-house studios. Yet despite their best efforts big companies with money have been unable to brute force their way to success. Video games are a yearslong endeavor requiring the hard work and talent of teams that can range from a handful of independent creators to hundreds of developers across the globe. Even when they produce decent games as Netflix has it takes more than a few titles to lure people away from their PlayStation Switch Steam or Xbox ecosystems—or even the new season of Bridgerton—to play them. Netflix knows that its biggest competition for attention on your phone comes down to apps like TikTok.

Part of the problem for Netflix at least might be about awareness. Despite acquiring outfits like Oxenfree creator Night School Studio and Dungeon Boss developer Boss Fight Entertainment the company’s investment into games doesn’t show in the way it markets and promotes them. (Just look at sites publishing well-read how-tos for finding Netflix games.) The streamer doesn’t have the best reputation when it comes to luring eyes to some of its more original ventures. The largely unknown fan site it launched in December had barely begun to germinate when it cut the majority of staff. It’s canceled dozens of shows after just one season—a list that continues to grow. With games it seems Netflix barely let users know they were there at all.

It would be easy to say the streaming giant isn’t gaining gamers because their offerings are bad but they’re not. Titles like sci-fi strategy game Into the Breach and card game Exploding Kittens are established hits that have done well on other platforms ahead of their mobile releases for Netflix. Originals that expand the company’s streaming universes like its Stranger Things games have built-in fanbases. Critics have positive things to say seemingly in spite of themselves. The games just haven’t been given time to gain traction.

Netflix did not respond to requests for comment about Apptopia’s findings or its handling of current titles though the giant has been clear about its continued ambition for mobile gaming. The company has plans to offer roughly 50 games by the end of 2022 including new releases such as Telling Lies creator Sam Barlow’s next title Immortality. Netflix is fond of iteration and its self-described “crawl walk run” model. Evidently gaming is still in that infant stage.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMi9kaWdpdGFsL25ld3MvZGlzbmV5LXN0cmVhbWluZy1zdWJzY3JpYmVycy1uZXRmbGl4LTEyMzUzMzg3NTIv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIyL2RpZ2l0YWwvbmV3cy9kaXNuZXktc3RyZWFtaW5nLXN1YnNjcmliZXJzLW5ldGZsaXgtMTIzNTMzODc1Mi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disney Now Has More Total Streaming Subscriptions Than Netflix — but Disney Generates Much Lower Per-Sub Revenue,"One headline number out of Disney‘s quarterly results Wednesday seemed to show a notable milestone: The Mouse House had 221.1 million total subscriptions worldwide across its streaming services (Disney+ Disney+ Hotstar Hulu and ESPN+). At first glance that makes it look like Disney is now just ahead of Netflix which ended Q2 with 220.7 million total paid subscribers.

But the value of those subscriber bases is much different.

Domestically for example Disney+ generated about 39% as much revenue per subscriber as Netflix for the second calendar quarter a measure referred to in the finance world as ARPU (average revenue per user). And overseas the contrast is even starker: Disney+ Hotstar which is available in India and other Southeast Asian countries — and represents 38% of the overall Disney+ customer base — had an ARPU of $1.20/month for the quarter ended July 2 while Netflix had an ARPU of $8.83/month for the Asia Pacific region.

Separately Netflix takes issue with comparing Disney’s subscriptions to Netflix’s subscribers. According to the way Disney tallies its streaming numbers one household that takes the Disney Bundle — with Disney+ Hulu and ESPN+ — is counted as three separate subscriptions. A much better apples-to-apples comparison would show Disney’s unduplicated streaming subscribers (i.e. households) but that’s a figure the company does not disclose.

Popular on Variety

When Disney+ first launched in November 2019 it rapidly amassed market share by pricing the streamer at the low low price of $6.99/month. That was nearly half Netflix’s standard plan at the time.

But that low entry point has meant Disney’s flagship streamer makes less money than Netflix the historical category leader. For the three months ended July 2 Disney+ domestic ARPU (U.S. and Canada) was $6.27 per month a 5% decline from the year earlier likely the result of a skew toward the Disney Bundle and inclusion of Disney+ (and ESPN+) in Hulu’s live TV package. That’s compared with Netflix which reported an ARPU of $15.95 per month in the U.S./Canada region for Q2 up 10% due to price increases.

Now Disney+ is trying to raise its profitability profile as U.S. streaming subscriber growth has slowed for not just Disney+ but nearly every player in the biz. In the U.S. and Canada Disney+ picked up just 100000 paid subs in the recent quarter to reach 44.5 million.

Concurrent with its earnings release Disney announced a 38% price hike for the “premium” Disney+ no-ads version of the service which will go up to $10.99/month on Dec. 8 2022. That same day the media company will introduce Disney+ Basic an advertising-supported tier that will be available at the previous $7.99/month price.

That of course is designed to drive up Disney+’s ARPU with the combo of the price increase (offset by the inevitable resulting churn) and the into of the ad-supported Disney+ Basic tier which could produce higher ARPU if the Mouse House can successfully monetize it at the high ad rates execs have touted.

Hulu also is set for a price hike in Q4: On Oct. 10 the price of Hulu with ads will go up a buck from $6.99 to $7.99 per month while the ad-free tier will go up two dollars from $12.99 to $14.99 per month. For the most recent quarter the ARPU for Hulu’s subscription VOD service (available only in the U.S.) was $12.92 per month — down 2% year over year again likely because of bundle discounts. That’s higher than Disney+ but still below Netflix’s ARPU in the region.

ESPN+ ARPU nosed up 2% to $4.55/month for the quarter ended July 2. As previously announced ESPN+ rates will increase by three dollars monthly in August going from $6.99 to $9.99 per month.

Disney expects Disney+ to reach profitability in fiscal year 2024 (which ends that September). In the most recent quarter the media conglomerate’s streaming losses increased: Disney’s direct-to-consumer revenue was $5.06 billion for the quarter up 19% — but below Wall Street expectations of $5.2 billion per FactSet. The operating loss for the DTC segment ballooned to $1.06 billion versus $293 million in the year-earlier period. (Netflix posted Q2 revenue of $7.97 billion and net income of $1.44 billion.)

“As a result of this slowdown in new subscriber additions we have seen many in the industry pivot to a new wave of sobriety” — with a focus on streaming profitability MoffettNathanson principal analyst Michael Nathanson wrote in an Aug. 11 research note. “We on Wall Street have taken notice. Gone are the sum-of-the-parts models using revenue multiples or even the metric of EV/content spending. From here on out we hope the focus for streamers is return on invested capital and free cash flow generation.”

Also note that while Disney expects “core Disney+” growth to continue on its expected trajectory through 2024 the company cut projections for Disney+ Hotstar over that time period given the loss of Indian Premiere League cricket rights. With the warning about a slowdown in India Disney lowered the subscriber target for Disney+ over to 215 million-245 million global subscribers by the end of its fiscal year 2024 down from 230 million-260 million previously.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvZGlzbmV5LWp1c3QtcGFzc2VkLW5ldGZsaXgtaW4tdG90YWwtc3RyZWFtaW5nLXN1YnNjcmliZXJzLTEyMzUwODkzNjEv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC9kaXNuZXktanVzdC1wYXNzZWQtbmV0ZmxpeC1pbi10b3RhbC1zdHJlYW1pbmctc3Vic2NyaWJlcnMtMTIzNTA4OTM2MS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disney’s Streaming Services Passed Netflix In Total Subscriptions – Update,"UPDATED with subscription vs. subscriber clarification: Walt Disney‘s total DTC subscriptions all in totaled 221.1 million for the company’s fiscal third quarter ended in June. That was a big beat for Disney+ and its parent.

It also passed Netflix in total subscriptions. That streamer noted today that subscriptions and subscribers are not apples to apples. Netflix most recently reported 220.67 million total global subscribers. The main difference is Netflix doesn’t have bundles.

Disney counts subscribers to SVOD bundles as one for each service included. (As in subscribers to Hulu Live TV + SVOD offerings are counted as one each for Hulu Live TV + SVOD Disney+ and ESPN+.) “When we aggregate the total number of paid subscribers across our DTC streaming services we refer to them as paid subscriptions” Disney’s earnings release says.

Disney’s numbers include Disney+ (152M) ESPN+ (22.8M) and Hulu total including Live TV at (46.2M).

Disney will shed some subscribers down the line after losing a bidding war for streaming cricket rights in India where a big chunk of Disney+ subs are based.

So the numbers may shift but ebb and flow shows just how volatile the streaming business is.

Netflix the established leader set off a wave of jitters with an unexpected loss of 200000 subscribers in the first quarter of 2022 and warned of a potentially steeper loss for the following quarter of up to 2 million. When it came out with loss of just under 1 million subs — about 970000 — that was viewed in part as a victory. It was the biggest sub loss in the company’s history (saved in part by fourth season of Stranger Things that was released in May).

The Reed Hastings and Ted Sarandos-led giant is also in the process of rolling out a ad-supported streaming tier.

Media stocks rallied today along with broader markets. Disney is up nearly 5% and Netflix is flat in after-market trading. Disney announced its quarterly numbers just after market close."

FOURTH QUARTER COMPANY RESULTS

The Company reported total quarterly revenues of $3.03 billion a 5% increase from the $2.89 billion reported in the prior year quarter. Affiliate fee revenues increased 4% with 7% growth at the Television segment and 2% growth at the Cable Network Programming segment. Advertising revenues increased 7% primarily due to stronger pricing and higher ratings at FOX News Media higher political advertising revenues at the FOX Television Stations and continued growth at TUBI. Other revenues increased 4% primarily due to the impact of the consolidation of entertainment production companies and higher FOX Nation subscription revenues partially offset by the timing of sports sublicensing revenues.

The Company reported quarterly net income of $308 million as compared to the $272 million reported in the prior year quarter. Net Income attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders was $306 million ($0.55 per share) as compared to the $253 million ($0.43 per share) reported in the prior year quarter. Adjusted net income attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders1 was $413 million ($0.74 per share) as compared to the $381 million ($0.65 per share) reported in the prior year quarter.

Quarterly Adjusted EBITDA2 increased 7% to $770 million from $717 million reported in the prior year quarter led by higher contributions at the Television segment.

FULL YEAR COMPANY RESULTS

The Company reported total full year revenues of $13.97 billion an 8% increase from the $12.91 billion reported in the prior year. Affiliate fee revenues increased 7% with 10% growth at the Television segment and 5% growth at the Cable Network Programming segment. Advertising revenues increased 9% primarily due to higher pricing at FOX Sports and FOX News Media continued growth at TUBI and the return of a full schedule of live events at FOX Sports. These advertising gains were partially offset by lower political advertising revenues. Other revenues increased 15% primarily due to higher sports sublicensing revenues and FOX Nation subscription revenues at the Cable Network Programming segment and the impact of the consolidation of entertainment production companies at the Television segment.

The Company reported full year net income of $1.23 billion as compared to the $2.20 billion reported in the prior year. This was primarily due to the change in fair value of the Company's investments recognized in Other net. Net Income attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders was $1.21 billion ($2.11 per share) as compared to the $2.15 billion ($3.61 per share) reported in the prior year. Adjusted net income attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders was $1.59 billion ($2.79 per share) as compared to the $1.71 billion ($2.88 per share) reported in the prior year. The effective income tax rate was higher for both the quarter and the full year primarily due to a remeasurement of the Company's net deferred tax assets associated with changes in the mix of its jurisdictional earnings.

Full year Adjusted EBITDA was $2.96 billion as compared to the $3.09 billion in the prior year as the revenue increases noted above were offset by higher expenses. The increase in expenses primarily reflects increased digital investment at TUBI and FOX News Media costs associated with the launch of the USFL and higher programming rights amortization associated with normalized sports and entertainment schedules that were impacted by COVID-19 in the prior year.

NOTE 1 – ADJUSTED NET INCOME AND ADJUSTED EPS

The Company uses net income and earnings per share (""EPS"") attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders excluding net income effects of Impairment and restructuring charges adjustments to Equity (losses) earnings of affiliates Other net and tax provision adjustments (""Adjusted Net Income"" and ""Adjusted EPS"" respectively) to evaluate the performance of the Company's operations exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period.

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are not measures of performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to and not as substitutes for net income attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders and EPS as reported in accordance with GAAP. However management uses these measures in comparing the Company's historical performance and believes that they provide meaningful and comparable information to management investors and equity analysts to assist in their analysis of the Company's performance relative to prior periods and the Company's competitors.

The following table reconciles net income and EPS attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS for the three months ended June 30 2022 and 2021:

NOTE 2 – ADJUSTED EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling general and administrative expenses. Adjusted EBITDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution investments Depreciation and amortization Impairment and restructuring charges Interest expense net Other net and Income tax expense.

Management believes that information about Adjusted EBITDA assists all users of the Company's Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company's portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net income thus providing insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. Adjusted EBITDA provides management investors and equity analysts a measure to analyze the operating performance of the Company's business and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors' data although historical results including Adjusted EBITDA may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors including customer tastes and preferences and the impact of COVID-19 and other widespread health emergencies or pandemics and measures to contain their spread).

Adjusted EBITDA is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for net income cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items such as depreciation and amortization and impairment charges which are significant components in assessing the Company's financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Money,"Since its creation nearly nine years ago The Information has built itself into a solid subscription business that consistently delivers analysis and scoops about the tech world primarily to a lucrative audience of high-flying C-suite-ers. Founder and CEO (and Vanity Fair New Establishment alumna) Jessica Lessin wouldn’t cough up just how many subscribers the publication now has but she did share a personnel move that stands to take its reader-revenue mojo to the next level: The Information has hired News Corp veteran Karl Wells as its first chief commercial officer a role that reflects according to Lessin how “we’re really gonna ramp up on the business side.”

By the looks of his résumé Wells has been a subscription wizard at News Corp’s Dow Jones unit for the past seven years most recently as chief subscriptions officer a role that includes consumer oversight of Barron’s MarketWatch and Lessin’s old stomping grounds The Wall Street Journal. Before that Wells worked for The Sun News Corp’s ferocious U.K. tabloid which flirted with a paywall back in 2013 only to do a 180 about two years later. “He’s coming aboard to really build out the next phase of The Information” Lessin told me plugging two other new recruits in a similar vein: Michelle Evers who recently left her post at Time to oversee The Information’s brand partnerships; and George Diguido formerly of Insider as vice president of growth. “I’m thrilled with the growth of our subscription business and it has been very organic but we’re just scratching the surface on the growth of that business the growth of our B2B corporate business our brand-partnerships business around events and so on. So what Karl’s gonna do is ramp that up across the board.”

In the absence of cold hard numbers Lessin said revenues are up 35% year-over-year and that The Information has more than 360000 “active readers” meaning only a certain slice of them are paying readers. (Others get free newsletters and comped articles and such.) The company’s headcount is now north of 50—about two-thirds of those in the newsroom—and Lessin said she thinks they could “easily double” that within the next couple of years. But what to make of the “brain drain” I read about recently a bunch of Information folks—including heavyweights like Jessica Toonkel and Martin Peers—departing for the likes of Bloomberg Politico and the Journal? “I see talent flowing towards us” Lessin countered. “We just hired rock stars from The New York Times and Bloomberg. I think as we become more influential we have a reputation as being a great magnet and platform for talent. I feel pretty good about the direction we’re headed in.”

Apart from the new hires there was something else that Lessin—who moonlights as an angel investor in start-ups including the forthcoming Justin Smith and Ben Smith project Semafor—wanted to riff about in the wake of this week’s news that Axios has sold itself to Cox Enterprises for $525 million. “We’re building this company over the very long term” she said. “We don’t have investors. I own the company. We’re not coming up with ‘We need to hit this number to sell the company in three years.’ Twenty or 30 years from now I think the Times will be around. The Journal. Bloomberg. We’ll be around. I don’t think any of these V.C.-backed start-ups are gonna be around.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vY2Euc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL3J1cGVydC1tdXJkb2NoLW5ldC13b3J0aC1kaWQtMDkzODQwOTcyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What is Rupert Murdoch's net worth? How did he make his money and what companies does he own?,"He is the 71st richest in the world (PA)

Media mogal Rupert Murdoch has become one of the richest in the world.

He owns hundreds of media outlets across the globe including the likes of The Sun and The Times through his media company News Corp.

He clearly has a love for business and famously said “Money is not the motivating force. It’s nice to have money but I don’t live high. What I enjoy is running the business”.

He also owns Twentieth Century Fox Fox News Sky News Australia and publisher HarperCollins.

But how exactly did he get to where he is now and what is his net worth?

How did Rupert Murdoch make his money and what is his net worth?

Rupert Murdoch 91 was born in Melbourne in 1931 before becoming a US citizen in 1985. When he was 22 his father died and he inherited the family business. He was first tasked with running The News a small Adelaide newspaper. He then went on to acquire a number of newspapers in Australia and New Zealand. Over the next fifteen years Murdoch’s portfolio expanded and was valued at more than $50 million.

According to Forbes  his fortune currently stands at a huge $19.1 billion (£15.6 billion) making him the 31st richest person in the United States and the 71st richest in the world.

What are the companies Rupert Murdoch currently owns under News Corp?

News Corp Australia

That includes the likes of Fox Sports Australia Nickelodeon (a joint venture with Paramount Global) and Sky News Australia.

News UK

Including some of the UK’s biggest radio stations such as talkSPORT and Virgin Radio which fall under Wireless Group. He also owns a number of newspapers and magazines under News UK including The Sun The Times and The Sunday Times.

Harper Collins

The list includes 4th Estate Collins Ecco Press Harlequin Enterprises Harper Perennial Harper Voyager and more.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMTEvb3Bpbmlvbi9wZW5ndWluLXNpbW9uLXNjaHVzdGVyLXB1Ymxpc2hpbmcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion | Consolidation of Book Publishers Is a Threat to a Diverse Literary Marketplace,"OXFORD Miss. — Penguin Random House the largest English-language trade book publisher in the world has made an offer to acquire Simon & Schuster another large publisher and one of its rivals. For American consumers this is bad news. Allison Hill the chief executive of the American Booksellers Association a trade association that promotes independent bookstores like mine said the sale “threatens to undermine competition … and put bookstores and authors at risk.” A lawyer for the Justice Department which is suing to block the purchase commented that the lawsuit “will prevent further consolidation in an industry that has a history of collusion.”

The problem is not what we know about these giant publishers or specifically about Penguin Random House or Simon & Schuster; we know that they and the other publishers that make up the so-called Big Five publish many good books and they probably will continue to deal fairly with the bookstore world in the near future. What I worry about are the writers and books that will not get published or could be otherwise marginalized because of this even greater concentration of power.

If the Penguin Random House deal is successful the Justice Department argues that the resulting merged company would control close to half of the best-seller market continuing a longer history of publisher acquisitions mergers and consolidation. This extraordinary shift in the balance of power in one of our nation’s most important industries has gone largely unremarked upon even if it may change the kinds of books most Americans learn about and choose to read.

And who are these remaining publishing giants? Penguin Random House (owned by Bertelsmann a German company) which I will now pair with Simon & Schuster (formerly Paramount Global American-based); HarperCollins (News Corp maybe an American corporation maybe Australian depending upon who’s asking and so convoluted it might as well be another country); Hachette (Lagardère a French group); and Macmillan (Holtzbrinck another German company). Together these four corporations make up 80 percent of the U.S. book market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9iaXp3b21lbi9uZXdzL2xhdGVzdC1uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDgvemV0dGUtbmV3cy1tZWRpYS1zdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zLWdlbnotbWlsbGVubmlhbHMuaHRtbD9wYWdlPWFsbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Media startup Zette targets Gen Z millennial readers with monthly subscriptions - Bizwomen,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/bizwomen/news/latest-news/2022/08/zette-news-media-subscriptions-genz-millennials.html?page=all on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9iaXp3b21lbi9uZXdzL2xhdGVzdC1uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDgvemV0dGUtbmV3cy1tZWRpYS1zdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zLWdlbnotbWlsbGVubmlhbHMuaHRtbD9wYWdlPWFsbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

NEW YORK Aug. 10 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Fox Corporation (Nasdaq: FOXA FOX; ""FOX"" or the ""Company"") today reported financial results for the three months and twelve months ended June 30 2022.

Commenting on the results Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer Lachlan Murdoch said:

""We completed another successful year at FOX with Fiscal 2022 results demonstrating the strength and durability of our core brands and their ability to deliver consistent audiences across the entirety of FOX. These results validate the strategy we embarked on three years ago – to focus on live news and sports while investing in high growth digital initiatives to create a platform for ongoing growth. We begin Fiscal 2023 with strong momentum supported by an enviable schedule of live sporting events and the mid-term election cycle and bolstered by a best-in-class balance sheet. These attributes will serve us well in navigating any macroeconomic uncertainty while continuing to create value for our shareholders.""

FOURTH QUARTER COMPANY RESULTS

The Company reported total quarterly revenues of $3.03 billion a 5% increase from the $2.89 billion reported in the prior year quarter. Affiliate fee revenues increased 4% with 7% growth at the Television segment and 2% growth at the Cable Network Programming segment. Advertising revenues increased 7% primarily due to stronger pricing and higher ratings at FOX News Media higher political advertising revenues at the FOX Television Stations and continued growth at TUBI. Other revenues increased 4% primarily due to the impact of the consolidation of entertainment production companies and higher FOX Nation subscription revenues partially offset by the timing of sports sublicensing revenues.

The Company reported quarterly net income of $308 million as compared to the $272 million reported in the prior year quarter. Net Income attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders was $306 million ($0.55 per share) as compared to the $253 million ($0.43 per share) reported in the prior year quarter. Adjusted net income attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders1 was $413 million ($0.74 per share) as compared to the $381 million ($0.65 per share) reported in the prior year quarter.

Quarterly Adjusted EBITDA2 increased 7% to $770 million from $717 million reported in the prior year quarter led by higher contributions at the Television segment.

FULL YEAR COMPANY RESULTS

The Company reported total full year revenues of $13.97 billion an 8% increase from the $12.91 billion reported in the prior year. Affiliate fee revenues increased 7% with 10% growth at the Television segment and 5% growth at the Cable Network Programming segment. Advertising revenues increased 9% primarily due to higher pricing at FOX Sports and FOX News Media continued growth at TUBI and the return of a full schedule of live events at FOX Sports. These advertising gains were partially offset by lower political advertising revenues. Other revenues increased 15% primarily due to higher sports sublicensing revenues and FOX Nation subscription revenues at the Cable Network Programming segment and the impact of the consolidation of entertainment production companies at the Television segment.

The Company reported full year net income of $1.23 billion as compared to the $2.20 billion reported in the prior year. This was primarily due to the change in fair value of the Company's investments recognized in Other net. Net Income attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders was $1.21 billion ($2.11 per share) as compared to the $2.15 billion ($3.61 per share) reported in the prior year. Adjusted net income attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders was $1.59 billion ($2.79 per share) as compared to the $1.71 billion ($2.88 per share) reported in the prior year. The effective income tax rate was higher for both the quarter and the full year primarily due to a remeasurement of the Company's net deferred tax assets associated with changes in the mix of its jurisdictional earnings.

Full year Adjusted EBITDA was $2.96 billion as compared to the $3.09 billion in the prior year as the revenue increases noted above were offset by higher expenses. The increase in expenses primarily reflects increased digital investment at TUBI and FOX News Media costs associated with the launch of the USFL and higher programming rights amortization associated with normalized sports and entertainment schedules that were impacted by COVID-19 in the prior year.

NOTE 1 – ADJUSTED NET INCOME AND ADJUSTED EPS

The Company uses net income and earnings per share (""EPS"") attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders excluding net income effects of Impairment and restructuring charges adjustments to Equity (losses) earnings of affiliates Other net and tax provision adjustments (""Adjusted Net Income"" and ""Adjusted EPS"" respectively) to evaluate the performance of the Company's operations exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period.

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are not measures of performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to and not as substitutes for net income attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders and EPS as reported in accordance with GAAP. However management uses these measures in comparing the Company's historical performance and believes that they provide meaningful and comparable information to management investors and equity analysts to assist in their analysis of the Company's performance relative to prior periods and the Company's competitors.

NOTE 2 – ADJUSTED EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling general and administrative expenses. Adjusted EBITDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution investments Depreciation and amortization Impairment and restructuring charges Interest expense net Other net and Income tax expense.

Management believes that information about Adjusted EBITDA assists all users of the Company's Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company's portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net income thus providing insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. Adjusted EBITDA provides management investors and equity analysts a measure to analyze the operating performance of the Company's business and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors' data although historical results including Adjusted EBITDA may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors including customer tastes and preferences and the impact of COVID-19 and other widespread health emergencies or pandemics and measures to contain their spread).

Adjusted EBITDA is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for net income cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items such as depreciation and amortization and impairment charges which are significant components in assessing the Company's financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Money,"Since its creation nearly nine years ago The Information has built itself into a solid subscription business that consistently delivers analysis and scoops about the tech world primarily to a lucrative audience of high-flying C-suite-ers. Founder and CEO (and Vanity Fair New Establishment alumna) Jessica Lessin wouldn’t cough up just how many subscribers the publication now has but she did share a personnel move that stands to take its reader-revenue mojo to the next level: The Information has hired News Corp veteran Karl Wells as its first chief commercial officer a role that reflects according to Lessin how “we’re really gonna ramp up on the business side.”

By the looks of his résumé Wells has been a subscription wizard at News Corp’s Dow Jones unit for the past seven years most recently as chief subscriptions officer a role that includes consumer oversight of Barron’s MarketWatch and Lessin’s old stomping grounds The Wall Street Journal. Before that Wells worked for The Sun News Corp’s ferocious U.K. tabloid which flirted with a paywall back in 2013 only to do a 180 about two years later. “He’s coming aboard to really build out the next phase of The Information” Lessin told me plugging two other new recruits in a similar vein: Michelle Evers who recently left her post at Time to oversee The Information’s brand partnerships; and George Diguido formerly of Insider as vice president of growth. “I’m thrilled with the growth of our subscription business and it has been very organic but we’re just scratching the surface on the growth of that business the growth of our B2B corporate business our brand-partnerships business around events and so on. So what Karl’s gonna do is ramp that up across the board.”

In the absence of cold hard numbers Lessin said revenues are up 35% year-over-year and that The Information has more than 360000 “active readers” meaning only a certain slice of them are paying readers. (Others get free newsletters and comped articles and such.) The company’s headcount is now north of 50—about two-thirds of those in the newsroom—and Lessin said she thinks they could “easily double” that within the next couple of years. But what to make of the “brain drain” I read about recently a bunch of Information folks—including heavyweights like Jessica Toonkel and Martin Peers—departing for the likes of Bloomberg Politico and the Journal? “I see talent flowing towards us” Lessin countered. “We just hired rock stars from The New York Times and Bloomberg. I think as we become more influential we have a reputation as being a great magnet and platform for talent. I feel pretty good about the direction we’re headed in.”

Apart from the new hires there was something else that Lessin—who moonlights as an angel investor in start-ups including the forthcoming Justin Smith and Ben Smith project Semafor—wanted to riff about in the wake of this week’s news that Axios has sold itself to Cox Enterprises for $525 million. “We’re building this company over the very long term” she said. “We don’t have investors. I own the company. We’re not coming up with ‘We need to hit this number to sell the company in three years.’ Twenty or 30 years from now I think the Times will be around. The Journal. Bloomberg. We’ll be around. I don’t think any of these V.C.-backed start-ups are gonna be around.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vY2Euc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL3J1cGVydC1tdXJkb2NoLW5ldC13b3J0aC1kaWQtMDkzODQwOTcyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What is Rupert Murdoch's net worth?

Media mogal Rupert Murdoch has become one of the richest in the world.

He owns hundreds of media outlets across the globe including the likes of The Sun and The Times through his media company News Corp.

He clearly has a love for business and famously said “Money is not the motivating force. It’s nice to have money but I don’t live high. What I enjoy is running the business”.

He also owns Twentieth Century Fox Fox News Sky News Australia and publisher HarperCollins.

But how exactly did he get to where he is now and what is his net worth?

How did Rupert Murdoch make his money and what is his net worth?

Rupert Murdoch 91 was born in Melbourne in 1931 before becoming a US citizen in 1985. When he was 22 his father died and he inherited the family business. He was first tasked with running The News a small Adelaide newspaper. He then went on to acquire a number of newspapers in Australia and New Zealand. Over the next fifteen years Murdoch’s portfolio expanded and was valued at more than $50 million.

According to Forbes  his fortune currently stands at a huge $19.1 billion (£15.6 billion) making him the 31st richest person in the United States and the 71st richest in the world.

What are the companies Rupert Murdoch currently owns under News Corp?

News Corp Australia

That includes the likes of Fox Sports Australia Nickelodeon (a joint venture with Paramount Global) and Sky News Australia.

News UK

Including some of the UK’s biggest radio stations such as talkSPORT and Virgin Radio which fall under Wireless Group. He also owns a number of newspapers and magazines under News UK including The Sun The Times and The Sunday Times.

For American consumers this is bad news. Allison Hill the chief executive of the American Booksellers Association a trade association that promotes independent bookstores like mine said the sale “threatens to undermine competition … and put bookstores and authors at risk.” A lawyer for the Justice Department which is suing to block the purchase commented that the lawsuit “will prevent further consolidation in an industry that has a history of collusion.”

The problem is not what we know about these giant publishers or specifically about Penguin Random House or Simon & Schuster; we know that they and the other publishers that make up the so-called Big Five publish many good books and they probably will continue to deal fairly with the bookstore world in the near future. What I worry about are the writers and books that will not get published or could be otherwise marginalized because of this even greater concentration of power.

If the Penguin Random House deal is successful the Justice Department argues that the resulting merged company would control close to half of the best-seller market continuing a longer history of publisher acquisitions mergers and consolidation. This extraordinary shift in the balance of power in one of our nation’s most important industries has gone largely unremarked upon even if it may change the kinds of books most Americans learn about and choose to read.

And who are these remaining publishing giants? Penguin Random House (owned by Bertelsmann a German company) which I will now pair with Simon & Schuster (formerly Paramount Global American-based); HarperCollins (News Corp maybe an American corporation maybe Australian depending upon who’s asking and so convoluted it might as well be another country); Hachette (Lagardère a French group); and Macmillan (Holtzbrinck another German company).

news@seacoastonline.com

SEABROOK — An investigation by NextEra Energy confirmed “human error” was responsible for the false alarm that sounded last month at its nuclear power plant in Seabrook.

NextEra Energy spokesman Bill Orlove said Thursday that new procedures are being established at the plant to ensure it doesn’t happen again and to improve communication gaps discovered during the incident.

Orlove said the company underwent a thorough investigation of the July 12 event that led to the inadvertent activation of its emergency preparedness siren system.

New Hampshire Executive Council member Janet Stevens R-Rye previously revealed the specific human error after meeting with nuclear plant officials. She said the inadvertent test siren alarm was ""triggered by a siren technician at the nuclear plant ... and the siren technician activated the PA key on the siren control panel — which is located one row directly above the 'silent test' key.""

Ten of the 121 sirens sent out verbal alerts along New Hampshire’s coastline beaches telling people to leave the area due to a problem at the power plant. The probe indicated the false alarms took place due to “human error” during a regular silent testing of the system that had gone on every two weeks for 30 years without any previous problems he said.

Orlove said it is important to note that at the time of the false alarm there was no problem existing at NextEra Energy Seabrook’s nuclear power plant which was operating normally. He added there was no malfunction of the sirens themselves.

Further Orlove said the investigation showed personnel at the power plant “communicated that there was no plant emergency through local county and state agencies in New Hampshire and Massachusetts and through local and regional media outlets.”

Seabrook Station implements new protocols

As a result of the investigation NextEra is putting into effect new procedures to ensure a similar situation doesn’t happen again Orlove said.

“Seabrook Station and NextEra Energy Seabrook which operates the facility has taken the following measures” according to Orlove. “Revise the process for silent testing of the emergency sirens with additional safeguards including enhanced oversight to verify test procedures and removing pre-programmed commands for siren activation; retrain staff who test the emergency siren system; increase management oversight during a system test; share our lessons with state partners who also conduct emergency tests.”

During and after the July 12 event local officials emergency responders and the public were critical of the time it took to notify all involved that the alarm was a mistake. It took almost an hour for the state’s Emergency Management Office – the entity responsible for sending out that information to the public – to broadcast a press release that the activation was a mistake. It took about two hours for an alert to be sent to cell phones in the regions letting the public-at-large know of the error.

In the meantime local officials in beach communities had difficulty confirming the alert was erroneous and had to deal with some people panicking and those who “poured off the beaches” trying to evacuate the area as the sirens’ message advised.

More reviews of Seabrook incident underway by NH and NRC

On July 19 Tyler Dumont public affairs officer for New Hampshire Commissioner of Public Safety Robert Quinn said the time lag related to the fact that the FEMA-approved state emergency management plan for the nuclear power plant did not have a contingency for an inadvertent siren activation at Seabrook Station. However he said the department was in the process of creating one.

Quinn a Seabrook resident added “Our team is working diligently to conduct a review of this incident and identifying the shortcomings that contributed to this event.”

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission the federal agency which oversees safety operational and environmental issues at nuclear facilities across the country said it’s also investigating the July 12 incident at Seabrook Station.

The gap in the state’s emergency plan for Seabrook Station also exposed other issues such as how best to get out emergency messages in light of modern communication technologies. The sirens’ message informed the public to leave and turn on their radios for more information but in 2022 radios aren’t seen as the most effective way to communicate emergencies.

NextEra working on improving communication methods

According to Orlove prior to the July 12 incident NextEra was looking into that very issue.

“... The company planned to transition to the federal emergency system called IPAWS” according to Orlove said. “This system is currently used for weather alerts or to communicate an Amber Alert that many cellphone users receive on their device and transmits messages via local TV and radio stations. It contacts cellphone users by sending a signal to the cell towers located within a certain area. This would ensure that everyone in a specified area whether they are residents of New Hampshire or Massachusetts or visitors to those states will receive the message.”

According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency the Integrated Public Alert & Warning System or IPAWS unites the nation’s Emergency Alert System National Warning System Wireless Emergency Alerts and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Weather Radio under one platform. It’s designed to modernize emergency warnings and accommodates the way society now gets its information.

According to Orlove NextEra effectively implemented IPAWS at another of its nuclear power plants in Wisconsin and hopes to do the same for its New Hampshire plant in Seabrook.

“At Seabrook Station our top priority is the safety of everyone living and working in our neighboring communities” according to Orlove.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zcGdsb2JhbC5jb20vbWFya2V0aW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlL2VuL25ld3MtaW5zaWdodHMvbGF0ZXN0LW5ld3MtaGVhZGxpbmVzL3BnLWUtY29ycC1zLXBvcHBlLXdhcy1oaWdoZXN0LXBhaWQtdXMtdXRpbGl0eS1jZW8taW4tMjAyMS03MTUzODg1M9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PG&E Corp.'s Poppe was highest-paid US utility CEO in 2021,"PG&E Corp.'s Patricia Poppe unseated NextEra Energy Inc.'s Jim Robo as the highest-paid U.S. utility CEO in 2021 based on a combination of cash compensation stocks and options granted and nonequity incentive plan compensation.

Poppe who left CMS Energy Corp. at the end of 2020 to lead PG&E Corp. following the California holding company's $58 billion financial restructuring received total adjusted compensation of $51.2 million in 2021 including $41.2 million in stock awards according to an S&P Global Market Intelligence analysis of the 10 highest-paid U.S. utility executives in 2021. Nonequity compensation typically describes cash awards unrelated to stock performance.

As part of her move to PG&E Corp. Poppe received a one-time make-whole cash bonus of $6.6 million and 2910205 restricted stock units under the company's long-term incentive plan to account for the compensation she forfeited at CMS. Poppe's base annual salary is $1.35 million.

CenterPoint Energy Inc.'s David Lesar was the second-highest paid utility CEO in 2021 and saw his compensation package increase 200% to $37.8 million up from $12.6 million in 2020. In 2021 the holding company agreed to sell its Arkansas and Oklahoma gas utilities to Summit Utilities Inc. for $2.15 billion including the recovery of $425 million in cash for extraordinary unrecovered natural gas purchase costs that CenterPoint incurred during extreme winter weather in February.

NextEra's Robo saw his compensation increase nearly 7% to $24.3 million in 2021 from $22.8 million in 2020. The renewable energy giant completed the merger of Gulf Power Co. into Florida Power & Light Co. in January 2021 but the combined entity has come under scrutiny in 2022 for alleged secret political spending. Robo announced in January plans to step down as president and CEO effective March 1 and was succeeded by John Ketchum.

Of the highest-paid utility executives in 2021 only American Electric Power Co. Inc.'s Nicholas Akins saw his pay package decrease.

Montauk Renewables Inc.'s Sean McClain meanwhile had the biggest percentage change in compensation earning $9.4 million in 2021 compared to $600000 in 2020. Avangrid Inc. CEO Dennis Arriola's pay increased from $1.8 million in 2020 to $13.9 million in 2021 for the second-highest percentage change followed by Consolidated Edison Inc.'s Timothy Cawley. Arriola departed Avangrid in May.

FirstEnergy Corp. CEO Steven Strah's pay more than doubled from $3.3 million in 2020 to $8.8 million in 2021. Strah was appointed acting CEO on Oct. 29 2020 after the firing of former CEO Charles Jones Jr. and two senior executives as part of an internal review tied to the company's role in a bribery scheme.

PG&E Corp.'s Poppe was awarded the most stock and options of any U.S. utility CEO in 2021 while CenterPoint's Lesar and Avangrid's Arriola saw the second- and third-biggest increases in their stock and options compared to 2020.

SEABROOK N.H. (AP) — Authorities blamed human error Thursday for some sirens that were inadvertently activated at a New Hampshire nuclear power station last month.

The state Homeland Security and Emergency Management agency and plant owner NextEra Energy Resources put out statements more than 30 minutes after beachgoers in nearby Hampton and Rye said they heard announcements about the beaches being closed on July 12 because of a problem at the plant. Ten of the 121 sirens were activated. The announcements sent some beachgoers scrambling but officials said that there was no emergency nor danger to the public.

The plant is about 40 miles (64 kilometers) north of Boston and 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of Portsmouth. It has operated since 1990.

Signed by Trump in 2020 the moratorium banned new leasing for all types of energy off the coasts of Florida Georgia North Carolina and South Carolina. It went into effect last month (Energywire Sept. 29 2020).

The “Inflation Reduction Act” — which the Senate passed over the weekend and is expected to be taken up by the House soon — would strip away the ban on offshore wind lease sales while leaving it in place for oil and gas drilling.

But wind power has not generally experienced warm welcomes in the Southeast. Just one onshore wind farm — the Avangrid-owned Amazon Wind Farm near Elizabeth City N.C. — currently generates electrons across the four moratorium states. Interest in offshore wind also has been mixed.

Lifting the moratorium may not transform that reality even if Democrats’ climate bill becomes law some clean energy advocates and environmentalists acknowledge.

In places such as Florida Georgia and South Carolina state officials largely haven’t enacted measures to promote offshore wind. This is in stark contrast to the state guarantees to buy offshore wind power that were crucial to the industry’s emergence in the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic.

North Carolina stands out as the region’s clear exception taking concrete steps to embrace the industry. One of its major utilities Duke Energy won the right to generate power from federal lease areas for offshore wind in May as did French oil and gas major TotalEnergies SE. The state’s Democratic governor Roy Cooper also has laid out specific targets for the sector: 2.8 gigawatts by 2030 and 8 gigawatts a decade later.

Across other states however little groundwork has been done to establish offshore wind’s foothold as a future resource. And it remains unclear if or how quickly official indifference might transform into boosterism.

In South Carolina for instance Republican Gov. Henry McMaster recently signed a law calling for a first study of how offshore wind’s need for locally made parts and staging ports could benefit the state economically.

That could help convince South Carolinians that their state is well positioned to host the industry said Hailey Deres program associate at the Southeastern Wind Coalition.

Still Deres added “I don’t think that there is going to be any immediate push for an offshore wind project even if the moratorium is lifted.”

Action on offshore wind is probably farthest off in Georgia where initial explorations from Georgia Power a decade ago haven’t led to firm commitments and Florida where the federal government has yet to begin preliminary offshore wind scoping that would allow for commercial development.

The Southeastern states also face a physical disadvantage in their wind conditions at least compared with blustery waters like those off Massachusetts.

Generally speaking “Southern states have lower wind speeds on land and at sea so the potential is lower than the Northern states” said Walt Musial offshore wind research lead at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).

That might make developers less willing to attempt projects although Musial noted that wind conditions are still considered economic for power generation in many areas.

Still many offshore wind advocates are optimistic about ending the moratorium.

“The Southeast has historically not been viewed as the best place for wind energy development” but ending Trump’s moratorium would give states a chance to change that as North Carolina has already begun to do said Chris Carnevale climate advocacy director at the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.

Offshore wind could also complement solar — a focus of many Southern utilities’ development — by generating power at times when sunlight grows weaker allowing for a higher concentration of renewables on the grid he said.

“It would be a very positive thing for our region if the moratorium is lifted” said Carnevale.

Utility engagement

Offshore wind’s future in the Southeast might depend on a handful of factors different from those governing its rise in the Northeast.

First is the central role of utilities and state regulators.

Where climate commitments from Democratic governors and legislators — along with independent developers — drove growth in New England large utilities like Duke Energy Dominion Energy Georgia Power and NextEra will determine much of what happens in the southern Atlantic said South Carolina-based Aaron Barr global head of onshore wind research for Wood Mackenzie.

“It’s really hard to build anything particularly these massive offshore wind projects without some involvement from the regulated utilities in all of these states” Barr said. “The pathway for offshore wind in the Southeast is really through these regulated utilities.”

The moratorium removal is one of several dominoes falling in the Southeast to get the offshore wind industry — and its supply chain — moving he said.

“Now that this moratorium may be going away it really opens up a lot of doors” he said.

The cost of offshore wind power may also be more of a consideration in the region than in the Northeast where governors were often eager to profile themselves as climate leaders. Transmission costs to bring the electricity generated offshore to population centers inland can push up price tags.

Jennette Gayer of Environment Georgia said falling costs as the industry matures might demonstrate the case for offshore wind to officials in Georgia although her state shouldn’t wait for that proof she argued.

As turbines multiply across the East Coast “I expect we’ll see costs come down significantly” said Gayer. “We’re on pace to install a lot of offshore wind over the next couple of years. We should be doing that right now in the state of Georgia.”

Another special consideration for the Southeast — especially for Florida — may be vulnerability to hurricanes.

But that may be a challenge that diminishes over time. Technology is developing to deploy typhoon class turbines with larger rotors that can withstand hurricane-force winds said Musial of NREL. Those are also likely needed for the western and central Gulf of Mexico where the Biden administration is planning its first lease sales next year he said.

Florida’s offshore wind outlook may be limited by other unique pressures like its huge tourism industry sensitive environmental and wildlife implications shipping lanes and fishing impacts said Barr of Wood Mackenzie.

Put together those issues mean Florida may be a challenging offshore wind market he said. Yet it has extensive coastlines to offer and its two largest utilities both have strong wind credentials: Duke which is leading offshore wind in North Carolina and NextEra the largest onshore wind producer in the country.

None of the complications in Florida would entirely rule out offshore wind there particularly with the Biden administration’s push for offshore wind.

“I haven’t seen the same momentum for [the Interior Department] to create an offshore lease area off the coast of Florida as I have in the Carolinas” Barr said. “But you know this moratorium is over. That could easily happen.”

North Carolina exception

In North Carolina the offshore wind outlook has been picking up steam and some argue that the removal of the moratorium will only accelerate that.

That’s mostly due to Duke’s activity. The utility has long been the bellwether determining whether offshore wind could take off and its recent commitment to the sector — when it secured the highest bid for a lease off the state’s coast earlier this year — was seen by wind advocates as a turning point for the state. That’s in addition to the passage of a law last year mandating North Carolina utilities cut emissions by 70 percent by the end of the decade which offshore wind could help secure.

North Carolina Rep. Deborah Ross a Democrat who led the push to remove the moratorium said the ban had represented a threat to reaching those state targets.

“It would just be leaving a utility-scale resource you know off the table as we’re going through this energy transition” she said. “That’s the real reason for offshore wind is because it’s utility scale.”

Ironically the Trump-era moratorium may have helped offshore wind reach this pivotal moment in North Carolina.

A few months before it went into effect the Biden administration added two new lease areas to the North Carolina wind footprint with a combined capacity to power 500000 homes (Energywire May 12).

That came partly at the behest of Cooper North Carolina’s governor who wrote in March to the Interior Department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management urging it to finish work on the lease areas before the ban kicked in. Members of the state’s delegation made similar pleas.

“We saw … the lease sale make it over the finish line because of the moratorium. If anything it might’ve hastened that” said Carnevale of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.

The lease sale also introduced a new player into North Carolina’s offshore wind space to drive investment: France-based TotalEnergies which won one of the two leases.

TotalEnergies is one of the largest oil companies in the world and is experienced in offshore energy development. But importantly for North Carolina it’s also eagerly diversifying its portfolio to offset its carbon emissions on a quest to reach 100 gigawatts of renewable power by 2030.

Ross said removing the moratorium would mean a chance to scale up allowing the southern Atlantic states to compete for a slice of the U.S. offshore wind supply chain that’s going to be needed in the coming years from construction experts to build the first fleet of offshore wind farms to companies to service them once they are in action. There also will be the manufacturers that make the thousands of turbines blades towers foundations and nacelles needed to create this industry in the United States.

“It’s a shame because the moratorium was unnecessary” Ross said. “It really delayed things. But you know we’re getting it fixed pretty darn quick.”"
NKE,Nike,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ1bm5lcnN3b3JsZC5jb20vZ2Vhci9hNDA4NjI2ODQvdHJhaWwtcnVubmluZy1zaG9lLXNob290b3V0LWhva2EtbmlrZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trail Running Shoe Shootout | Nike and Hoka,"We’re living in a golden age of running when there are so many great running shoes that not only help you run faster but can make the miles more enjoyable. And while you may be tempted to just grab a single pair of trail running shoes and stick with it I argue that you’re better off employing the right shoe for specific uses.

Shoes are a tool after all. Just like you wouldn’t use scissors to cut your lawn you shouldn’t wear a on singletrack trails. And don’t use just any old pair of trail kicks when you’re climbing almost vertically up a black diamond ski slope in the summer.

I witnessed this firsthand when participating in the Whiteface Mountain Races in New York’s Adirondack Mountains. The event consisted of two unique challenges: A vertical kilometer which went straight up the ski slopes of the mountain that hosted the 1980 and 1932 Winter Olympics plus a 6.9-mile race that took runners up to the summit and back down to the base lodge—with nearly 4000 feet of climbing and descending.

The problem: What kind of shoe can claw into such steep terrain while still having enough underfoot comfort for such a punishing descent.



The options: As a gear tester here at Runner’s World I have access to lots of running shoes. I’ve run in 86 different models so far in 2022 as of when this article was published. So I dug through my shoe closet to find the trail shoes that I was enjoying most and the pairs that might work for the unique terrain.

I quickly narrowed down my pile to just three pairs: the ZoomX Ultrafly Trail (not yet publicly available)  and .

Looking at that list you see a trend emerge—thick and soft. I needed something that could bite into the ground when going up the slippery slopes but a shoe that might also save my aging legs on the way back down. It may come as a surprise to learn that running down a hill that’s 20 percent steep is harder than going up—or at least it leaves you far more sore the following few days.



The solution: There’s no better way to pick a shoe than to test it on comparable terrain. So that’s what I did. I don’t have an Olympic ski hill near my home in Easton Pennsylvania but I do have a local incline known on Strava as Marble Mtn Rat Jaw . I have no idea why it’s called that but here are the stats:

Distance: 0.34 miles

Elevation Gain: 425 feet

Average Grade: 23.4%

KOM: 5:13

Surface: Double-track road grass scree

Rat Jaw follows a power line which has just about as much in common as a ski resort if you think about it. Both are constructed on inhospitable terrain that nobody really wants to use for any other reasonable purpose. And the landowners don’t really care what the ground looks like. In the case of a ski resort it’s usually covered by many feet of snow. Power lines are nearly impassable and require little upkeep though you’ll often find a small two-track road following them.

This steep running segment gives me a mix of everything. The dirt is loose on the climb requiring fairly toothy lugs. And then there are grassy sections that are slippery unless you can fully plant the sole of your shoe flat on the ground. On the way down you unleash baseball-size rocks that careen downhill faster than you. It’s just not as long as Whiteface which worked okay for me so I could do several repeats while changing shoes on subsequent trips up and down.

Let’s take a look at how each shoe performed.

Trevor Raab The Nike ZoomX Ultrafly Trail left me feeling out of control coming down the steep hill.

Nike ZoomX Ultrafly Trail

This shoe is outmatched on this kind of terrain if you look at the specs on paper. It’s designed like most of what Nike builds for what I lovingly refer to as “western technical.” Here on the East Coast those are basically dirt roads or rail trails. The Ultrafly is built to zip along on trails that are buffed out heavily traveled and don’t really feature a ton of rocks or technical obstacles. It has the same bouncy ZoomX foam found in the Vaporfly but it’s wrapped in fabric to help boost durability and to contain it so you don’t get such a squishy uncontrollable sensation underfoot. The lugs are just a little too short and uniform to really excel on such steep and loose ground.

Trevor Raab The Nike ZoomX Ultrafly Trail has an outsole that’s best suited for non-technical trails.

So why the heck would I even consider this shoe?

Well it was new. The Ultrafly just arrived and I was having a ton of fun with it on some other local trails that are somewhat technical. I found the shoe to be nimble and lets me dance over rocks and roots at fast paces. The ZoomX midsole feels great—almost as comfortable as a road shoe.

How did it fare? Not so great to be honest but better than I expected. On the downhill I felt like I had good cushioning and perhaps the best runnability of the three shoes here but the lugs as I suspected weren’t long enough for the ascent or descent. On the loose stuff I had to fully plant my foot to get any kind of grip rather than just clawing with forefoot lugs like I hoped to do. On the descent I skidded a few times early and that completely shook my confidence in being able to stay upright.



If the race course was only half as steep this shoe would have been my frontrunner.

The Hoka TenNine has an enormous heel made for running down mountains.

Hoka TenNine

Who remembers this ridiculous shoe ? Was it a gimmick? Would I get laughed off the start line if I rocked up wearing that? Given Whiteface was a USATF Championship race could I even legally wear it (even if I’m no threat for medaling).

When snagging this shoe out of storage now 30 months old I had high hopes that it would crush the descent which is truthfully my weakest skill when racing mountains. After all that’s what this shoe was built for. Just look at that booty. That massive heel is built to make early contact with the ground and let you effortlessly roll onto your heel. Plus it puts an insane amount of sole in contact with the ground to boost stability at high speeds.

After I laced it up I wished for more grip on the climbs in the loose section. Rocks were coming unglued beneath my feet. It fared better than the Nike but I knew I’d be suffering as the mountain race course joined up with the VK path at the top of Whiteface—the steepest slowest section of the course. That giant heel was never a bother on the climb and even though the TenNine is among the top five heaviest shoes I’ve ever worn the shoe didn’t feel beefy at all.

Trevor Raab I wish the Hoka TenNine had just a little better grip when climbing.

The descent nearly earned this shoe a trip Upstate though. I threw caution to the wind unlike wearing the Nike because the first few strides were almost like being suction-cupped to the hill. When I hit loose rocks and gravel I skidded down the hillside but those big-ass skis under me didn’t wobble or veer. I felt controlled and stayed upright until I could get my other foot under me. These shoes really do let you run recklessly.

But before picking my date for race day I had to try one more.

Trevor Raab The Hoka Mafate Speed 4 has excellent traction whether you’re running uphill or down.

Hoka Mafate Speed 4

This is another new trail shoe that had just arrived for testing and I was really curious how it would perform. I’d used the earlier EVO versions and was really eager to see how this completely overhauled model stacked up. In fact I had put the EVO 2 to the test just after trying the TenNine in March 2020 right before the world went into lockdown for COVID-19. Here’s what I wrote in my training log after that first run:

I laced up the current Mafate to see how it compared on the same stretch of trail as the TenNine from a couple days ago. The climb was great but the descent wasn’t so hot. They’re definitely less stable and I twisted my ankle a couple times on the more technical sections. That said I was moving pretty good on the downhill. I wasn’t specifically pushing for a time but turns out I was only 5 seconds off my own Strava KOM for the descent from the power line to the parking lot.

Whether it’s the EVO Mafate or the Mafate Speed the shoes are built to deliver max cushioning and max grip in challenging terrain. Sounds like just what I needed but what about that ankle twisting I’d felt before?

It’s important to note that the Mafate Speed 4 is a new beast. The midsole and outsole have been completely overhauled from the Speed 3 with far more rubber extending into the midfoot which I feel gives even more security on technical terrain. Comparatively the EVO and Speed 3 had much more foam exposed through the midfoot though it was a rubberized EVA for improved durability.

Give me grip I say.

And grip is where this shoe shines. The lugs are tiered with three levels and lots of little edges. Made from Vibram Megagrip the Litebase rubber is grippy on soft ground while the lugs are soft enough to stick to hard ground and rocks.

Trevor Raab The Hoka Mafate Speed 4 has deeper lugs that hold to steep terrain better than the TenNine.

The two-layer midsole is Hoka’s ProFly+ setup which puts a softer foam closest to your foot for comfort and a dense responsive foam at the ground to give you a lively ride. As I took the shoe to the trail I knew I was going to love the protection. On the climb it didn’t feel mushy—I wasn’t wasting energy with each step going uphill. On the descents it didn’t have quite the same stable footplant as the TenNine but the Mafate was far more nimble. I never felt like I was out of control or reckless even when I sent a hailstorm of rocks down toward our photographer Trevor Raab. (Sorry Trevor!)

The Winner and How They Performed



Based on my testing I took a pair of the Mafate Speed 4 to Whiteface. Our video producer Pat Heine ran the Vertical K and he too opted for the same shoe.

Jeff Dengate Pat Heine also wore the Hoka Mafate Speed 4 when he raced the vertical K at Whiteface Mountain.

My route to the summit was a bit different than his but linked up with the VK climb to the summit. Then we took a slightly less steep route back to the base lodge though that route was still pretty treacherous.

Somewhere around 30 minutes into the race I figured it didn’t matter what shoes I wore because the day was going to be a sufferfest on the mountain. I was barely making any forward progress. (Pat told me after his race that his Garmin displayed ZERO for “current pace.”) Even so I was pouring buckets of sweat and my HR was hovering around 10K effort for much of the climb.

On the descent I wiped out only once but I can’t lay fault on the shoe. The first pitch down from the summit was extremely runnable even though it was littered with blow down from the off-season and had turned into a small stream from the run-off of the previous night’s rain. I was pushing the pace pretty good (for me) and I got a little bit cocky. One mountain access road took a big sweeping left-hand downhill turn and I went into it too hot. The shoe did its business holding onto whatever I pressed it against. The problem is that I planted it into a loose pile of dirt and rocks that just blew out from under me like dandelions on a gusty spring day. Buh bye. I somersaulted got my orange CPTC-Tracksmith all sorts of filthy and somehow managed to plant the rubber right-side down on the next stride continuing my downhill pursuit in one fluid motion. Sure I lost a little skin on my hip and knee but all-in-all it wasn’t too bad. I just wish there was a video to see if I was actually as graceful as I’m imagining. (Please don’t ruin my fantasy.)

Somewhere late in the race my left hip flared up from the long downhill pounding and I resorted to kind of dragging my leg along in a slow jog. As the ground flattened out a bit I couldn’t really take advantage of the shoes as I wanted instead just trying to get my butt off the mountain.

The Aftermath

Two days later I toed the line for a downhill road mile in Ticonderoga NY. The race drops 150 feet from start to finish. I was sure I’d be in for a world of hurt. But perhaps thanks as much to the shoes as to a set of Normatec 3 leg sleeves I lived in for the 48 hours between races I felt kind of okay. I was tired and my leg turnover was pathetically slow but in years past I would have been in more pain than I experienced. So if I’m faced with another steep up-and-down trail race I’m reaching for the Mafate Speed 4.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vc25lYWtlcmJhcmRldHJvaXQuY29tL25pa2UtYWlyLW1heC05Ny1hdGxhbnRpYy1ibHVlLXZvbHRhZ2UteWVsbG93LWRxOTEzMS00MDAtcmVsZWFzZS1kYXRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike Air Max 97 OG Atlantic Blue Neon DM0028-400 Release Date | SBD,"Back in 2017 Nike celebrated the 20th Anniversary of the Air Max 97 by reissuing both the “Neon” and “Atlantic Blue” colorways.

With the summer heat in full swing and more people spending time at home homeowners turn to do-it-yourself (DIY) work in and around their yards. National 811 Day is the perfect opportunity to remind folks the importance of calling 811 at least two business days before digging.

In 2021 23% of damages occurred because residents failed to call 811 before starting a digging project. The primary cause of damages in the late summer was due to fence installations and landscaping projects. If you contact 811 before you dig there’s less than a 1% chance of damaging a utility line.

When calling 811 homeowners and contractors are connected to Ohio 811 the local one-call center which notifies the appropriate utility companies of their intent to dig. Requests can also be conveniently made online at oups.org. Professional locators then arrive at the digging site to mark the approximate locations of underground lines with flags spray paint or both. Requests should be made at least two business days before digging this service is provided free of charge.

An underground utility line is damaged every few minutes because someone decides to dig without first contacting 811. Striking a single line can cause injury inconvenient outages incur repair costs and fines. With more people at home during the summer relying on their utilities to work properly outages are important to avoid. Every digging project no matter how big or small warrants contacting 811 by phone or online. Installing a mailbox building a deck planting a tree and laying a patio are just some examples of digging projects that require a call to 811 or a visit to oups.org before starting.

Recently the company blocked off the Miller Road crossing in the Avon/Avon Lake border for almost two hours.

“This incident caused a substantial traffic problem thus the citation into court” according to Avon Lake Police Department Lt. Sean Bockelman. “While a citation to a rail company is not common it does occur a few times a year.”

Bockelman said Norfolk Southern has been cited in the past and that this is the third time this year alone from Avon Lake.

According to Avon Lake court records Norfolk Southern has been cited about 50 times in the past in Avon Lake Municipal Court.

Connor A. Spielmaker a spokesman for Norfolk Southern said he can’t speak about this specific incident but commented overall on the company.

“We never want to inconvenience any member of a community with a blocked crossing” Spielmaker said. “Trains have to stop for a number of reasons including federally-mandated crew times or mechanical issues.

“Our teams work hard to keep trains moving and minimize these impacts when they happen.

The line operates as part of the Cleveland District of Norfolk Southern Railways which extends as far west to Bellevue on the border of Erie and Sandusky counties.

A Norfolk Southern representative must appear in Avon Lake Municipal Court on Aug. 30.

On one side Amtrak says the board should grant its request to run two daily trains between New Orleans and Mobile. Amtrak previously offered service along the Gulf Coast but that service stopped in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Amtrak argues that the other side — CSX Norfolk Southern and the Alabama State Port Authority — has been unsuccessful in proving that the additional service would harm freight rail service and service to and from the Port of Mobile.

“Amtrak’s additional analyses confirm that there will be no unreasonable impairment to freight transportation from the Gulf Coast service. CSX’s and NS’ arguments to the contrary are without merit and their predictions (as well as the port’s) about the impact resulting from two additional round-trip Amtrak trains are greatly exaggerated” attorneys for Amtrak said in a July 27 supplemental brief to the board.

On the other side CSX (NASDAQ: CSX) NS (NYSE: NSC) and the Alabama State Port Authority contend that the service would have adverse impacts to freight and port operations if no additional investments are made to the supporting infrastructure.

“While Amtrak has time and again urged the board to take a ‘wait and see’ approach by granting Amtrak immediate access without any supporting infrastructure this the board should not do. It is the rail shippers not Amtrak who will bear the consequences from additional delays and disruptions in rail service” attorneys for CSX and NS said in their July 27 filing.

STB had held a public hearing in February on the issue and then it held an evidentiary hearing that started in April and ran for several weeks.

In June the board determined that select Amtrak staff should review “highly confidential” market and operations information from CSX and NS so it could respond to questions raised from past hearings. The STB also ordered board-sponsored mediation for all parties.

The most recent filing to this ongoing proceeding was from last Thursday: Eastern U.S. railroads CSX and Norfolk Southern along with the Alabama State Port Authority are asking the STB to wrap up the collection of supplemental evidence on Aug. 31.





Amtrak: CSX and NS haven’t shown how passenger rail service would cause ‘unreasonable impairment’

In late July the parties reiterated their positions on how they think STB should rule in this proceeding.

Attorneys for Amtrak said CSX and NS failed to prove that the restoration of Amtrak service on the Gulf Coast would cause “unreasonable impairment” on the freight railroads. Amtrak said the two railroads must pass that bar in order to prevent Amtrak’s request for service from moving forward per federal mandate.

“Although Amtrak has provided additional evidence and analyses to fulfill the board’s request Amtrak’s position remains that the evidentiary burden is on the host railroads to demonstrate unreasonable impairment to freight transportation” attorneys for Amtrak said. “Because CSX and NS failed to meet this burden after an extensive evidentiary hearing Amtrak is entitled to an order in its favor regardless of the evidence submitted here which is in addition to the evidence Amtrak already provided at the hearing.”

Amtrak continued to say that the only evidence of impairment that CSX and NS submitted has been their rail traffic controller (RTC) model which even though Amtrak labeled the model as flawed “confirms Amtrak’s position” that its new service would result in minimal impacts to freight train speeds recrew rates and potential train delays.

Amtrak’s July 27 filing to STB included this chart. (Amtrak)

“Although Amtrak recognizes and appreciates that the board’s request for supplemental evidence is rooted in the board’s desire to protect the public interest Amtrak respectfully submits that Congress determined what is in the public interest through its statutory enactments concerning passenger rail” Amtrak said.

Amtrak added that it runs passenger trains “on far busier corridors” such as in and out of Chicago “without causing unreasonable impairment.” It also said it offered a capacity study showing there would be sufficient capacity to accommodate service between the two Southern cities.

CSX and NS: Amtrak needs to acknowledge anticipated impairments

While CSX and NS conceded that it must prove to STB that Amtrak’s proposed service would impair freight rail service they argued that Amtrak must also bear responsibility in showing how passenger rail service would affect the regional rail network.





“While Amtrak initiated this proceeding its consistent strategy is to claim that only the freight railroads had the burden of proving anything and to criticize alleged imperfections in the railroads’ RTC model and evidence rather than submitting any competing RTC analysis. But that is not how the statute works” attorneys for CSX and NS said in the July 27 supplemental filing.

They continued “Amtrak is the party seeking a board order. As such it has a burden of proof on all elements of the statute. … While CSXT and NSR have a burden of producing evidence as to impairment Amtrak has the burden of persuading the board that the anticipated impairment to current and future freight service is reasonable.”

Attorneys for CSX and NS said Amtrak “failed to rebut” the railroads’ evidence with its own evidence. That evidence includes forecasts on how freight rail and passenger rail service could be at odds with each other in the future under a do-nothing scenario.

For instance “the 2021 Gulf Coast RTC Model establishes that if the four passenger trains are added to the corridor today in 20 years from now (2039) their presence will result in a systematic failure in CSXT and NSR’s ability to provide freight service based on a modest anticipated growth rate. RTC is able to dispatch the 2039 case only if freight trains are permitted to block grade crossings in the model for up to two and a half hours” CSX and NS said.

Alabama State Port Authority: Port of Mobile’s terminal railway would be impacted by Amtrak service

Although attorneys for Alabama State Port Authority said that the port takes no position on whether CSX and NS have done enough to look at operational adjustments the railroads could do to accommodate Amtrak per board comment about CSX’s and NS’ testimonies to STB the port authority said its involvement in the proceeding was necessary given how Amtrak’s service could impact freight service in and out of the Port of Mobile.

The port authority operates the terminal railway at the port and as a first-mile/last-mile terminal operator the railway’s operations are heavily dependent upon the service demands of its customers and connecting line-haul carriers and CSX’s discretion in allowing the terminal railway access to CSX’s main line trackage in the Mobile terminal according to the July 27 filing from the port authority.

“As such the idea that TASD [the terminal railway at the Port of Mobile] has any true flexibility to adjust its operations to better accommodate Amtrak and avoid freight service impacts on its system are unfounded” attorneys for the port authority said.

“The sort of operating adjustments that Amtrak seems to think a carrier like TASD can undertake to avoid freight service disruption reveal just how badly out of touch Amtrak is when it comes to freight operations in terminal areas like Mobile and how little it understands about how Amtrak’s operations would impact interstate commerce” the port authority continued. “Amtrak’s suggestion that TASD could adapt its operations to accommodate Amtrak ignores the fact that TASD does not and cannot control the service needs of its customers or its freight carrier partners including CSXT over whose lines TASD has absolutely no control.”

Although the board wanted to hear from the port’s customers about the issue the port said it has been unable to procure such evidence for several reasons including “the highly politicized nature of the current dispute pitting freight carriers against Amtrak and a woefully one-track-minded Department of Transportation; (b) concern over the prospect of having to make statements against interests regarding potential harm that would impair investment or raise other such problems for customers that are part of publicly traded companies; (c) uncertainty about how exactly port service will be impacted; and (d) the reality that if the port were to convince customers that service would decline markedly (and that if the board were to allow that to happen in favor of Amtrak) those same customers would likely shift to utilization of other Gulf Coast ports.”

The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim arguing that the plaintiffs’ allegations are insufficient to lead to a finding that they violated their fiduciary duties. Judge Charles Ronald Norgle of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois has denied the motion.

Norgle noted in his opinion that the plaintiffs allege that the defendants violated their duty of loyalty by selecting and retaining plan investment options that generated unreasonable management fees for Northern Trust and by paying unreasonable recordkeeping fees. Specifically the plaintiffs take issue with the defendants’ decision to retain the 11 Northern Trust Focus Funds a target-date fund suite despite being able to offer allegedly better-performing TDFs at the same or lesser cost.

According to the court opinion since 2013 the Focus Funds have been the only target-date retirement investing options in the plan and they were the default investment option for plan participants. Norgle noted that according to the complaint even before their selection for the plan in 2013 the Focus Funds had underperformed relative to benchmark indices and comparable TDFs for three years.

The plaintiffs also allege that the defendants failed to conduct an appropriately competitive bidding process to negotiate low prices and imprudently selected and retained the higher-cost shares of investment options when the “only difference between the shares classes is the amount of fees.”

Norgle pointed out that in their motion to dismiss the defendants largely relied on a 2020 decision in Divane v. Northwestern University in which the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals emphasized that “any participant could avoid . . . excessive recordkeeping fees and underperformance . . . simply by choosing from hundreds of other options.” However he added in a unanimous opinion the Supreme Court vacated and remanded that decision in the case now known as Hughes v. Northwestern University. The high court held that the 7th Circuit’s reliance and “exclusive focus on investor choice” was flawed reasoning.

The defendants also cited wording in the 7th Circuit’s opinion in Divane to emphasize that the Employee Retirement Income Security Act does not “mandate what kind of benefits employers must provide” in an employee benefits plan. Norgle agreed that ERISA does not require that a plan offer TDFs for example but he pointed out that the plaintiffs are not arguing that it does. “They assert that a failure of adequate fiduciary process can be reasonably inferred from the totality of their allegations” he noted. Norgle agreed with the plaintiffs’ assertion.

According to the court opinion in a supplement to their motion to dismiss the defendants compared their case to Smith v. CommonSpirit Health in which the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals opined that “merely pointing to another investment that has performed better in a five-year snapshot of the lifespan of a fund that is supposed to grow for fifty years does not suffice to plausibly plead an imprudent decision.” Norgle noted that in contrast to the CommonSpirit case the plaintiffs in the Northern Trust case “plead consistent chronic underperformance for a decade.” In addition he said that the CommonSpirit plaintiffs compared actively managed funds to passively managed funds which the court described as “comparing apples and oranges” while the plaintiffs in the Northern Trust case compare the Focus Funds to similar TDFs. “The court is not persuaded that this case is comparable to Smith and the motion is denied” Norgle wrote in his opinion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBpb25saW5lLmNvbS9jb3VydHMvZXJpc2EtY2FzZS1hZ2FpbnN0LW5vcnRoZXJuLXRydXN0LWFsbG93ZWQtcHJvY2VlZC1qdWRnZS1yZWplY3RzLXBldGl0aW9uLWRpc21pc3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ERISA case against Northern Trust allowed to proceed,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.pionline.com/courts/erisa-case-against-northern-trust-allowed-proceed-judge-rejects-petition-dismiss on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBpb25saW5lLmNvbS9jb3VydHMvZXJpc2EtY2FzZS1hZ2FpbnN0LW5vcnRoZXJuLXRydXN0LWFsbG93ZWQtcHJvY2VlZC1qdWRnZS1yZWplY3RzLXBldGl0aW9uLWRpc21pc3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb21tZXJjaWFsYXBwZWFsLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvMjAyMi8wOC8xMS90b255LWZpbmF1LWNhbi1kby1uby13cm9uZy1mZWRleC1zdC1qdWRlLWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcC10aGlyZC1zdHJhaWdodC8xMDMwMzMzNTAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tony Finau can do no wrong at FedEx St. Jude Championship,"Adam Schupak

Golfweek

It’s a good thing that Tony Finau learned to fire knife dance as a kid.

His golf game has been on a serious heater of late. The 32-year-old Utah native of Tongan descent has registered victories in his two most recent PGA Tour starts. He fired 6-under 64 two strokes off the lead at TPC Southwind on Thursday to continue his blistering run at the FedEx St. Jude Championship.

“It started with a lowlight duck hooked my first tee shot” said Finau who trails Si Woo Kim and J.J. Spaun during the first round. “But I got lucky had a shot put it on the front of the green and chipped in. It wasn’t the ideal birdie start but we’re off and running.”

Finau who entered the week in seventh place in the FedEx Cup standings recorded his 10th straight round of 68 or lower becoming just the eighth player since 1995 to do so and is four rounds away from matching the longest streak during that time frame held by Tiger Woods.

Finau had gone 143 starts and a span of 1975 days between victories at the 2016 Puerto Rico Open and the 2021 Northern Trust at Liberty National Golf Club in New Jersey. That event was replaced by the St. Jude as the first of three FedEx Cup Playoff events. Technically Finau is considered the defending champion this week.

“Quite a different place” he said Tuesday during his pre-tournament press conference. “It’s definitely strange defending on a golf course that I haven’t won on.”

Finau won the 3M Open and the Rocket Mortgage Classic seven days apart but credits his win a year ago to kick off the playoffs as his breakthrough.

“Usually the hardest one to win is your first one” Finau said. “Mine was the Northern Trust because of how much time was in between the two and my own expectations in my mind of what could be and all the close calls I had. So to overcome that hurdle was huge and I think it’s kind of proven that over this last month.”

Finau skipped last week’s tournament the Wyndham Championship. He hosted his charity fundraiser and celebrated with his family including a birthday party for his daughter at a pool where he was caught on video accidentally dropping his wife’s cell phone in the water while dancing. The phone survived and it led to Finau rehashing the story of his days as a Polynesian dancer.

“My mom had a luau a traveling luau so that’s why I had to learn how to do the fire knife dance” he explained. “I’m not shy to dance and entertain just because I’ve been doing that since I was young and things.”

Finau also made sure he kept his game sharp by playing at home every day.

“I know how big these three weeks are” he said.

“Northrop Grumman-built satellites like Landsat 9 are vital to tracking the state of our planet” said Mike Witt chief sustainability officer Northrop Grumman. “The data they collect is vital to analyzing predicting and addressing changes to ecosystems helping us to better understand the role sustainability plays in securing a safer world.”

Landsat 9 will collect space-based images and data that will aid researchers in areas including agriculture geology land use mapping forestry global change research and water resource management. The Landsat images further support international emergency and disaster relief to save lives of those in areas most affected by natural disasters. Landsat 9 is based on Northrop Grumman’s flight proven LEOStar-3 platform and extensively leverages the design of the Landsat 8 spacecraft which has been in service since 2013.

“Landsat 9 continues the uninterrupted monitoring of our Earth by building on the 50-year legacy of the NASA and USGS Landsat system” said Steve Krein vice president commercial and civil satellites Northrop Grumman. “This is the fourth Landsat satellite built by Northrop Grumman that plays a critical role of global observation for monitoring understanding and managing Earth’s natural resources.

The comment from the CEO of the third-largest cruise company in the United States is a significant step away from what the competition has been doing recently.

Focussing on creating a long-term strategy of offering steady pricing and a competitive onboard environment is the way forward Del Rio said in his second-quarter earnings call.

This is why guests sailing onboard NCLH’s ships will likely not be seeing discounted cruises while paying up to 20% more for a voyage compared to 2019.

Past Experiences Forming Future Strategy

In the second-quarter earnings call held yesterday Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings made it clear it will not be sacrificing profitability in the long term for a short-term effect.

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings has been sailing at around 65% occupancy levels but filling up the ships at all costs is not something the CEO will be considering.

Frank Del Rio CEO and President of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings: “I’ve managed cruise companies in good times and in bad times and I am convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that you don’t sacrifice the long-term pricing power of your brand in order to achieve short-term load factor gains.”

“I’m not willing to mortgage the company for 10-plus years in order to window dress the next quarter’s results I just won’t do it. We’re here for the long term. We’re managing the business on a long-term basis.”

That long-term plan means NCLH and its three brands Norwegian Cruise Line Regent Seven Seas and Oceania Cruises will not be offering guests any discounted cruises to be able to bring occupancy levels to 100%.

That strategy could just be the right call to make looking back at events in the past. During the financial crisis of 2009 cruise companies went all-out to get people to sail. The effects of those strategies took some companies more than ten years to recover from.

Del Rio: “I remind you what happened back in ’08 and ’09 when the Great Recession certain cruise companies did drop their prices to ridiculous levels. And it took them in some cases 10-plus years and in some cases they’ve not yet reached those pre-Great Recession yields.”

Long-Term Bookings Looking Stronger Than Ever For NCLH

Looking at the long term the strategy that NCLH is looking at seems to be the right call as long as the company can survive with lower occupancy rates in the near term.

Del Rio: “Our guiding principle has been a focus on the long-term profitability of the company particularly for 2023 and beyond by protecting our long-term brand equity and building on our industry-leading pricing. This means making intentional tactical sacrifices in the short term in favor of long-term sustainable results.”

Bookings for 2023 are looking stronger than ever; even with 20% more capacity across the fleet Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings is looking at a 40% increase in bookings for the coming year built up by the relaxing of COVID-19 measures and the upcoming maiden voyage of Norwegian Prima.

With ships currently sailing at 65% increasing to 85% lately the 40% increase will mean that ships will be sailing full next year. And NCLH is making those bookings with prices that are 20% higher than they were in 2018 and 2019.

De Rio continued: “In the second quarter our load factor was approximately 65% in line with our expectations and a significant improvement versus the prior quarter of 48%. We expect load factors to increase to the low 80% range in the third quarter with July already coming in at 85%. This steady sequential ramp is expected to continue until we reach historical 100%-plus levels beginning for the second quarter of 2023.”

What Does It Mean For Those Looking To Book?

Pricing strategies aside the fact of the matter remains that the financial markets are showing record inflation numbers a volatile currency exchange market and a fuel market that is reaching record highs.

Put all that together; no matter what cruises will be more expensive. The only thing that Frank Del Rio is saying is that his company will not be lowering prices to get more guests onboard.

Companies that lower pricing forfeit profitability. While this may seem a good idea short-term guests will inevitably pay the price somewhere whether through onboard purchases tour pricing or other additional costs. At a minimum while sailing onboard the NCLH ships guests know what they paid for and why.

There will always be discounted cruises available just not at Norwegian Cruise Line Regent Seven Seas or Oceania. And that may well be a good thing for the company and guests alike.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2EtbWFqb3ItY3J1aXNlLWxpbmUtaGFzLWFubm91bmNlZC1hLTIwMjQtMjUtc2NoZWR1bGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Major Cruise Line Has Announced A 2024-25 Schedule,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/a-major-cruise-line-has-announced-a-2024-25-schedule on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2EtbWFqb3ItY3J1aXNlLWxpbmUtaGFzLWFubm91bmNlZC1hLTIwMjQtMjUtc2NoZWR1bGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9jcnVpc2UtbGluZS1zdG9ja3Mtb25ib2FyZC1wZXJrcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Do you own cruise line stocks? You could get onboard perks,"Many cruise fans choose to invest in cruise line stocks either because they want to support their favorite brand or because they view it as a financially savvy investment. But did you know that owning shares in a cruise company could give you onboard perks each time you cruise?

The major U.S. publicly traded cruise companies Carnival Corporation (which trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CCL) Royal Caribbean Group (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) all offer onboard credits ranging from $50 to $250 for those who own 100 shares or more of their stock.

Stock prices and any money you may or may not make from the investment are unpredictable. What is predictable are the perks. A small investment in a cruise company may pay off in more ways than you think especially if you are a frequent cruiser.

This is not advice about making a financial investment. Before buying any cruise stocks you should talk to your own adviser or broker and do your own research. Any financial investment is at your own risk.

Each cruise company has its own rules and nuances regarding the benefits of owning cruise line stocks. Here's how shareholder perks play out at the top three publicly traded cruise companies.

Carnival Corporation

Carnival Corporation is the parent company of cruise brands including Carnival Cruise Line Princess Cruises Holland America Cunard and luxury line Seabourn. If you hold a minimum of 100 shares of Carnival Corporation stock you'll receive an onboard credit of $250 per cabin for cruises of 14 days or longer $100 for cruises of seven to 13 days and $50 for cruises of six days or fewer. (Note that by ""days"" Carnival means nights on board.)

The current benefit is available on sailings through July 31 2023; reservations must be made by Feb. 28 2023.

You can use the credit for drinks gift shop purchases spa treatments or other onboard expenditures. You can't use the credit in the casino for gratuities or to get cash. The credit applies only to the shareholder-occupied stateroom; you won't get additional credits if you book multiple cabins.

To receive the credit first book your cruise vacation then send the specific cruise line an email fax or mailed letter with your legal name reservation/booking number ship and sailing date. You'll also need to provide proof — such as a copy of your proxy card or a dividend tax voucher — that you own 100 or more shares of stock.

The request needs to be made no later than four weeks before your sail date.

You'll find emails and addresses for each Carnival Corporation brand and specific rules on the company's website. For Carnival Cruise Line the email is shareholders@carnival.com the fax number is 305-406-6102 and the address is Guest Administration 3655 N.W. 87th Avenue Miami FL 33178.

Royal Caribbean Group

Royal Caribbean's shareholder perk applies to cruises on Royal Caribbean and Celebrity Cruises with the exclusion of any charter cruises (such as full-ship theme cruises) and Celebrity's Galapagos sailings.

Any shareholder with a minimum of 100 shares at the time of sailing is eligible for an onboard credit of $250 per stateroom for sailings of 14 or more nights $100 on sailings of six to 13 nights and $50 on sailings of five or fewer nights.

You may request the nontransferable credit each time you cruise. The credit applies only to the stateroom where the shareholder is staying and is based on double occupancy. If shares are held jointly and you are booking more than one stateroom 100 shares are required for each stateroom (based on one credit per shareholder per sailing and double occupancy). Single guests would have to pay 200% of the fare to receive the offer.

The credit can't be used for gratuities (service charges). It also doesn't apply to any activities you pay for prior to setting sail (such as prebooked shore excursions or spa treatments). It's credited to your shipboard account at the time of sailing.

Royal Caribbean suggests you request onboard credit two to three weeks prior to your sail date. The response from the cruise company should come within seven days.

You may make the request using the company's online form. For FAQs about the program visit Royal Caribbean's investor website.

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings

Norwegian offers holders of 100 or more shares of its stock an onboard credit of $250 per stateroom on sailings of 15 days or more $100 on sailings of seven to 14 days and $50 on sailings of six days or less. (Note that by ""days"" Norwegian means nights on board.) As with the other cruise companies you may request the onboard credit each time you cruise.

The offer applies to cruises on Norwegian Cruise Line Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises. Charter sailings are excluded.

To redeem the credit offer you may fill out a shareholder benefit request form online or you can mail or email the company with your name address email address telephone number ship and sailing date plus proof you hold the shares.

The onboard credit request must be submitted at least 15 days prior to your sailing date.

The benefit is only available for the stateroom in which the shareholder is staying and is based on your paying for two people in the cabin. Solo travelers must pay the full double occupancy fare to receive the credit. If shares are held jointly and you are requesting two or more cabins a minimum holding of 100 shares per room is required.

Norwegian does not allow the benefit to be combined with any other offer; shareholders have the option to choose between the shareholder benefit and another offer. The credit appears on your onboard account at the time of sailing and is nontransferable. It can't be used for any activities purchased prior to sailing nor for service charges/gratuities on board.

The email for Norwegian Cruise Line requests is shareholderbenefit@ncl.com. The address to mail in a request is Norwegian Cruise Line Shareholder Benefit Department 7665 Corporate Center Drive Miami FL 33126. Find addresses for the other brands and facts about the program on the company's investor website.

Bottom line

You can receive onboard credit each time you cruise by purchasing 100 or more shares of stock from a major publicly traded cruise company. This is a perk for shareholders not a reason to invest. Before agreeing to buy cruise line stock you should read the rules carefully and weigh the price of the stock versus any savings you will receive as well as understand the potential risks of your investment. Your financial adviser or broker may offer further advice.

Innovation may be at the heart of Norwegian Cruise Line but when it comes to upscale sister brand Oceania Cruises innovation is subtle and more gradual especially when it comes to food and beverages.

“A theme that persists throughout Oceania’s history is that of constant innovation” Howard Sherman president and CEO of Oceania Cruises told a small group of media onboard Oceania’s Marina during a town hall-style meeting this week. But more importantly “what to innovate and at what pace” he added.

“We don’t want people to miss anything” added Franco Semeraro senior vice president of hotel operations. “If anything we want to add something to Vista.”

With that said the line is removing two of its signature dining options from Vista – Jacques and La Reserve – and adding two new venues. To ensure loyal Oceania cruisers aren’t missing the two omitted dining options aspects of each will be added to other venues onboard.

In the case of Jacques the signature restaurant helmed by famed chef Jacques Pepin select dishes will be added to the main menu in the Grand Dining Room.

“The idea will be for dinner to have an appetizer a main course and a dessert which is from Jacques Pepin” said Alexis Quaretti director of culinary programs and development.

In the case of La Reserve a selection of the most popular dishes will be moved to the extra-fee and ultra-exclusive Privée.

Two restaurants that will get the least number of tweaks will be Red Ginger and Toscana both of which have a loyal following among past Oceania cruisers.

“We will never touch our miso sea bass” Semeraro said. “We will never touch our chicken curry. We will never touch our watermelon and duck salad. These are the core of that menu.”

One dish that will be added to the Red Ginger menu will be a chicken ramen noodles option.

“We will tweak our pasta [at Toscana]” Semeraro said adding “without the mistake of taking away the lasagna again.”

At Polo the American sirloin steaks will be replaced by Basque beef sourced from San Sebastian.

New Restaurants

New dining venues onboard will include Ember Aquamar Kitchen and a French bakery located next to the barista.

Ember will be an American-style steakhouse open for lunch and dinner. Aquamar will offer health-focused cuisine for breakfast and lunch along with a selection of zero-proof cocktails – a first for the line. (Zero-proof wines will also be added to the wine menus throughout the ship.)

Also new will be two private rooms one each located in Polo Grill and Toscana. The rooms will be for up to 10 people and will offer the regular menu at each location as well as an exclusive menu with wine pairings that cost extra.

In total between the new dining venues changes at the signature restaurants and tweaks to the Grand Dining Room menu Oceania will try out more than 400 new recipes on Vista Quaretti said. Those that are successful will eventually be rolled out to the rest of the fleet.

One additional new dining venue will roll out first on Riviera when it comes out of dry dock later this year. A new pizzeria and wings place will be located in what now houses the milkshake bar which will move to a more prominent location on the pool deck.

Ship Refurbishments & Innovations

It’s not only the food and beverage programs that get the innovation treatment.

“Beyond the best food at sea we strive for constant innovation in all areas” Sherman said. “One of those for us has always been the ships…Our idea is that as we go forward for our ships to always be better than the day they were delivered. And what that requires is that whenever we dry dock them not only that we replace everything and put it into pristine condition but that we make improvements all the time.”

Already Oceania’s R-series of ships (Regatta Insignia Nautica) have received recent comprehensive refurbs. Later this year Riviera will undergo a total down-to-the-bones refurbishment as will Marina in 2023.

The majority of rooms will be taken down to their bare bones and redone though Oceania Suites and Vista Suites will keep their configuration. But all soft goods throughout the ship including all carpeting and window treatments will be replaced. The colors Semeraro said will be more contemporary though he emphasized the design will remain more traditional and not modern.

“The fleet has never been in better condition than it is today so there has never been a better time to sell Oceania Cruises to your guests than today” Sherman said.

Itinerary Developments

One thing Sherman emphasized; Oceania’s ships are not meant to be a destination unto themselves.

“These are floating five-star hotels that take you from destination to destination so you can explore the world” he said.

He also added that the types of itineraries the cruise line offers have changed over time gradually becoming longer and with more overnights.

“I think when we’re launching our ’24 and ’25 season we’re going to have 73 of these what I call Grand Voyages that’ll range from 18 days in length to 200 days in length. You can take a 200-day voyage without repeating ports.”

In 2023 the line is offering more than 500 overnights as well.

In addition Sherman said Oceania takes great pride in finding new ports including “destinations they didn’t know they wanted to go to until we told them about it… We are going to continue to try and find you those ports that are truly special and aren’t filled with 15000 of your friends from back home.

COVID-19 Protocols

During the Town Hall Sherman also touched on the recent announcement by Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings that all three of its brands (including Oceania) will permit nonvaccinated guests onboard with nothing more than proof of a negative COVID-19 test.

W. Va.) there isn’t much in the way of consequences for big CO2 emitters in Democrats’ new climate bill. But there are huge new rewards for high-emitting companies to pump their greenhouse gasses underground and for facilities that propose to remove emissions directly from the atmosphere. Those provisions have the startups investors and legacy oil companies proposing to provide that service over the moon. “We’re definitely going from a curiosity to a priority” says Steve Lowenthal chief commercial officer of Frontier Carbon Solutions a carbon capture startup. “This changes the game.”

The Inflation Reduction Act which passed the Senate on Monday and is poised to pass the House on Friday includes a dramatic change in a crucial tax credit for the carbon capture industry—increasing the government subsidy for capturing CO2 from polluting sources from $50 to $85 per metric ton. Developers say that raising that incentive could tip many projects that once weren’t worth the investment over the financial finish line. The new bill also simplifies the process for receiving those tax credits and opens the subsidy to smaller carbon capture projects which together essentially fulfill a full industry wishlist for new carbon capture legislation.

“The fact that [the legislation] actually happened isn’t a big surprise” says Adrian Corless CEO of CarbonCapture a direct air capture startup. “The fact that it actually came out in such a good form and actually came out [so soon] is much better than we expected.”

Formerly the tax incentive known as 45Q only paid enough to convince investors to fund the easiest carbon capture projects like pipelines to capture CO2 from ethanol processing facilities which emit almost pure CO2 from tanks where corn is fermented into vehicle fuel. Emissions from power plants and other industrial facilities contribute hugely to climate change but the actual gas escaping from their smoke stacks contains a much lower percentage of CO2 (coal plant emissions for example are about 13% CO2) and the fact that that CO2 has to be first separated out from the other gasses makes it much more expensive to capture it and store it underground.

But raising the incentive to $85 per ton means projects that capture carbon dioxide from industrial facilities with lower CO2 concentrations like natural gas processing facilities and cement plants could become financially viable. “It really can’t be [overstated] how meaningful 85 [dollars per ton] is to the industry at large” says Lowenthal.

The package also gives a good deal of government support to a fledgling industry proposing to remove carbon dioxide directly from the air increasing tax credits for removing CO2 from the atmosphere to $180 per ton. “It’s going to make it easy for us to raise the capital to build the project earlier and to build it faster” says Corless

Massive Industry Boost

The new bill comes on top of last year’s infrastructure law which doled out a huge helping of government support for the sector including $100 million for the Department of Energy to design pipelines to transport compressed CO2 emissions to underground storage sites $2.1 billion in loans and grants for the private sector to build the pipelines and $3.5 billion to construct four “hub” facilities to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (although together those facilities will be able to sequester less than 0.1% of the CO2 the U.S. emits each year).

Taken together the measures could help the fledgling industry grow 13-fold by 2035 according to the Carbon Capture Coalition an industry group representing startups and oil majors like Shell. “Together with the historic investments made in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law this package would provide the most transformative and far-reaching policy support in the world for the economywide deployment of carbon management technologies” wrote the coalition’s external affairs manager Madelyn Morrison in a July 28 press release.

Oil company Shell which has eyed carbon capture as a potential growth avenue lauded the changes as well. “We see the Inflation Reduction Act’s carbon capture-related provisions as key to developing projects that will help reduce emissions in critical industrial sectors” the company’s media representatives said in a statement to TIME.

International players have also taken note. “It will establish the United States as the place to be to deploy such technologies” says Christoph Gebald co-founder of Swiss direct air carbon capture company Climeworks which opened the first commercial CO2 removal plant in Iceland last year. “And I am very convinced that this will also kick off a spiral of action from investors.”

Environmentalists Remain Skeptical

Not everyone sees the industry’s likely expansion as a good thing. Until now carbon capture technology has never really ramped up in a big way despite years of talk by emitters. Many projects have ended in expensive failures while others never were able to achieve the emissions cuts they promised when the energy costs of running the carbon capture equipment were factored in. Carbon capture funding is one of the few climate provisions that tends to get bipartisan support but many environmentalists have long portrayed it as a costly distraction from urgently needed emissions cuts as well as a handout to oil companies that tout the technology as a new revenue stream.

That’s especially true of a controversial provision in the tax code that gives incentives to companies that pump the captured carbon underground in order to extract more oil rather than just to permanently store it. (The new climate bill raises the government’s reward for this so-called “enhanced oil recovery” to $60 per ton.)

Many in the environmental world however agree that we will need some carbon capture to decarbonize hard-to-abate industries like cement production and that we will need to scale up atmospheric carbon removal technology in the decades ahead in order to have any hope of reaching net-zero targets. But those efforts also won’t do much if they’re not also accompanied by dramatic emissions cuts across society.

Jim Walsh policy director at Food and Water Watch says the new legislation relies too heavily on carbon capture. A popular emissions analysis of the legislation from Princeton University’s REPEAT Project counts on companies to quickly scale up carbon capture projects that promise to deliver a fifth of total U.S. emissions cuts by 2030 even though the technology hasn’t been able to achieve significant climate benefits in the past. “The Inflation Reduction Act does not deliver mandates to cut pollution. It creates incentives that may drive up private investment and it delivers billions to fossil fuel corporations based on the notion that their climate pollution can be somehow captured” he wrote in an Aug. 11 statement. “This is a dangerous bet.”

Fueling Local Battles

The incentives and proposed expansion to the industry are likely to also set off local controversies. In Iowa plans to build massive new pipelines to transport carbon dioxide have become a political flashpoint over the past year. Activists and landowners are facing off against investors and a pro-carbon capture governorship over plans to build massive pipelines to transport carbon dioxide released from ethanol plants to underground storage sites in North Dakota and Illinois. Proponents of the pipelines say they will make a serious dent in Iowa’s greenhouse gas emissions and help benefit farmers who grow corn that serves as a feedstock in the state’s ethanol industry. But opponents including local environmentalist groups say the pipelines put Iowans at risk of dangerous CO2 leaks and prop up an obsolete high polluting ethanol industry while trampling on local farmers who will have to allow developers to build through their land.

Last week this battle reached a new pitch when one of the developers Summit Carbon Solutions notified state regulators that it would begin filing for eminent domain in order to take control of private land it needs to build the pipeline.

“Summit showed their true colors today” wrote Food & Water Watch organizer Emma Schmit in an Aug. 5 press release. “Summit may seek eminent domain but [it] is our public institutions accountable to the people that will be responsible for the final decision.”

The genesis of Summit’s project goes back to a 2018 change in the 45Q tax credit which raised the payment from about $24 per ton to $50 giving the developers an economic incentive to start building the pipeline. Speaking with TIME in February Summit executives said another increase in 45Q like the one the Senate just passed might push them to look at building even more pipelines to capture emissions from farther-flung ethanol plants. That would seem likely to throw even more fuel on the fire in Iowa—potentially the first of many such clashes as federal funding helps the industry scale up in the years ahead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8zLXByb3Zlbi13YXlzLXJpY2gtZHVyaW5nLTIwNDUwMDExNi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here are 3 proven ways to get rich during a recession — without having to risk a bunch of money to do it,"Here are 3 proven ways to get rich during a recession — without having to risk a bunch of money to do it

Certain politicians have dismissed the idea that the U.S. is currently in a recession. But if you look up the textbook definition it seems like we can’t avoid using the “R” word anymore.

A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of real GDP contraction. And real GDP in the U.S. decreased at an annual rate of 1.6% in Q1 followed by 0.9% decline in Q2.

Recessions are prolonged downturns in economic activity usually associated with falling retail sales lower industrial production declining wages and higher unemployment.

The good news? Downturns also provide plenty of opportunities for regular people to build wealth.

Warren Buffett likes these 2 investment opportunities outside of the stock market

There’s a ‘perfect storm’ brewing in the multifamily housing market — here are 3 of the easiest ways to take advantage

Stocks

Every investor wants to buy low and sell high. A stock market downturn during a recession might be an opportune time for bargain hunters.

While the GDP contraction in Q1 and Q2 wasn’t too severe stocks have already fallen — by a lot.

The S&P 500 is down about 20% in the first six months of 2022 marking its worst first-half performance since 1970.

Investors who want to scoop up shares on the cheap might want to be cautious and focus on companies that can thrive during a recession.

Warren Buffett for instance loaded up on shares of food giant Kraft Foods (which later merged with Heinz to create Kraft Heinz) and electric utility NRG Energy (NRG) during the Great Recession of 2008.

According to Hartford Funds the S&P 500 actually gained 3.7% on average during the 13 recessions since 1945.

You don’t need a lot of cash to start investing. Some investing apps even allow you to buy fractions of shares with as much money as you are willing to spend.

Real estate

Real estate offers another potentially lucrative opportunity during a recession.

A recession doesn’t necessarily mean we are going to see a drop in property prices. But one specific factor could deter the upward momentum in the real estate market: interest rates.

Right now the Fed is raising its benchmark interest rates aggressively to tame spiking inflation. Higher interest rates are bad news for real estate.

When the cost of borrowing is high it makes people think twice about getting a loan to purchase a home or investment property.

Real estate mogul Sam Zell — also known as the “Grave Dancer” — made a fortune from buying properties when no one else wanted to.

Story continues

In 1973 when the economy fell into a recession the real estate market tumbled as many loans went into default. In that environment Zell was able to acquire a portfolio of high-quality properties at a significant discount.

If you’ve been eyeing investment properties in recent years a recession-driven pullback in prices might provide a good entry point.

These days new services make it easy for you to get into the real estate game no matter how big (or small) your budget is.

Starting your own business

Not everyone wants to start their own business. But according to The Economist 47% of millionaires are business owners.

Being an entrepreneur is not easy and the idea of building a business in a recession — when other businesses might be shutting down — can seem daunting. But going against the herd has its advantages.

“Right now is the time to take advantage of an open field. Your competitors are pulling back — spending less money on marketing and advertising” says Charles Gaudet CEO of business consultant and coaching agency Predictable Profits. “Some started laying off employees. Others are content to sit tight and hope for the best.”

When there’s less competition you have a better chance of establishing a position in the market.

Of course if you’re not ready to quit your job and go all-in on a business idea just yet think about starting a “side hustle” first.

There’s no magic formula to getting rich quickly. Whether it’s investing in stocks real estate or starting your own business it’s important to do your own research and evaluate your financial situation first.

NVIDIA releases the Avatar Cloud Engine as well as updates to PhysX MDL and other technologies.

Recent decades have seen tremendous technological advancements as well as an increase in the number of digitized goods and services. And due to innovative technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) robotics biotechnology and nanotechnology the rate of change appears destined to quicken.

According to Analytics Steps 60% of businesses now employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) a kind of machine learning that enables computers to comprehend and control human speech. Additionally machine learning is now being used actively for business solutions by 70% of the companies.

These technologies have already had a huge positive impact. NVIDIA however wants to strengthen that initiative even more and reshape the future of design and content creation in every industry.

Having said that NVIDIA recently unveiled a comprehensive plan to develop Universal Scene Description (USD) an extensible and open-source language for 3D worlds into a platform for the open metaverse and 3D internet.

“We’ve been talking about the metaverse for a long time and we see the metaverse as the extension of the internet. The internet today is largely two-dimensional – It’s the web and with the introduction of the metaverse we’re making the internet spatial and 3D” said Rev Lebaredian vice president of Omniverse and simulation technology at NVIDIA.

NVIDIA will pursue a multi-year roadmap to increase USD’s capabilities beyond visual effects enabling it to better support industrial metaverse applications in architecture engineering manufacturing scientific computing robotics and industrial digital twins.

“We believe that universal scene description (USD) which was invented by Pixar and open source in 2015 is the standard on which the metaverse is being built. We’ve been contributing to it for many years now and have increased our investment in this area” said Lebaredian.

Lebaredian claims that USD will enable 3D artists developers and others to collaborate cooperatively across various workflows and apps as they create virtual worlds in addition to media and entertainment. “Working with our community of partners we’re investing in USD so that it can serve as the foundation for architecture manufacturing robotics engineering and many more domains” he added.

Updates in NVIDIA’s innovative technologies portfolio

In addition to USD NVIDIA also introduced NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) a set of cloud-native AI models and services that facilitate the creation of realistic virtual assistants and digital humans.

By moving these models and services to the cloud ACE gives companies of all sizes instant access to the enormous computing power required to create and deploy assistants and avatars that comprehend multiple languages react to voice commands interact with their surroundings and provide insightful recommendations.

Furthermore the company unveiled the following platform updates:

Omniverse Kit — a toolkit for building native Omniverse extensions and applications:

○ Major improvements to PhysX® in Omniverse such as real-time multi-GPU scalable soft body and particle cloth simulation have helped increase the physical accuracy of virtual worlds and objects.

○ New OmniLive Workflows — An overhaul of USD-based collaboration in Omniverse offering faster 3D workflows across various apps and enabling non-destructive USD workflows to facilitate easier than ever cooperation between artists and developers

The upcoming GeForce graphics card also seemingly wields faster clock speeds than the RTX 4090 accompanied by VRAM specs that point towards GDDR6X memory.

The latest Nvidia RTX 4070 GPU leak from Kopite7kimi comes with a few predicted spec tweaks hammering home the fact the green team isn’t dead set on SKUs. The GeForce card is faster than originally planned as it’ll allegedly rock 2310MHz base clock and 2610MHz boost clock speeds. As the latter isn’t always a solid ceiling the leaker says the GPU’s ‘max’ speed sits around the 2800MHz mark.

Nvidia also seems to have changed its mind on RTX 4070 memory as Kopite7kimi says the graphics card will come equipped with 21Gbps GDDR6X VRAM. That means most of the RTX 4000 lineup might arrive with Micron’s high-spec memory as we’re still waiting to hear if the RTX 4060 will receive a VRAM revamp ahead of release.

An RTX 4000 specs revolving door

Got that usual grain of salt? Good as the ever-changing nature of RTX 4000 rumours adds uncertainty to predictions and insider information. Just last week we heard that a souped-up RTX 4070 Ti could be on the cards but the non-Ti card now appears to boast similar abilities.

RTX 4000 release date information is currently a bit precarious as whispers suggest only the RTX 4090 will arrive this year. In other words we’ll potentially need to wait longer for other best graphics card contenders like the RTX 4080 to arrive.

There’s still a chance they’ll beat AMD RDNA 3 GPUs to the punch as CEO Lisa Su says it’ll unleash its next-gen Radeon cards “later this year.” That said it sounds like Nvidia has a few things to figure out before any sort of RTX 4000 reveal so use a pencil rather than pen when it comes to your gaming PC diary.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vM2R2Zi5jb20vZW4vbnZpZGlhLXdhbnRzLXRvLW1ha2UteW91ci12b2x1bWV0cmljLWRhdGEtbGlnaHRlci1pcy1uZXVyYWx2ZGItdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS1vZi1vcGVudmRiL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA wants to make your volumetric data lighter: is NeuralVDB the future of OpenVDB?,"This article is also available in: French

At SIGGRAPH 2022 NVIDIA unveiled NeuralVDB a new technology aimed at “bringing AI and GPU optimization to OpenVDB”.

As a reminder OpenVDB is an open-source C++ library widely used in the VFX and animation industry for simulating and rendering sparse volumetric data. OpenVDB provides both a hierarchical data structure and a suite of tools in order to store and manipulate this data. To sum it up: OpenVDB is a key component of the way we simulate and render water fire smoke.

NeuralVDB is introduced by NVIDIA as an improvement over OpenVDB with impressive features. According to NVIDIA “NeuralVDB delivers up to 100x reduction in memory footprint”. This dramatic improvement could be a game changer since complex volumetric datasets require a huge amount of memory. NeuralVDB could allow users to work on the same projects on lower end workstations.

Furthermore NeuralVDB also includes the GPU acceleration of NanoVDB which was unveiled last year by NVIDIA. According to the company NanoVDB “opens the door to real-time simulation and rendering”.

NeuralVDB is therefore both faster and lighter thant OpenVDB. It also allows the weights of a frame to be used for the following one which accelerates training by up to 200%. Furthermore by using the network results from the previous frame explains NVIDIA NeuralVDB “enables users to achieve temporal coherency or smooth encoding”. One of the consequences is that users won’t have to rely as much on post-processes such as motion blur to get the result they want.

NVIDIA announced that NeuralVDB was “built to be compatible with preexisting VDB pipelines”: adoption should therefore be quite seamless. NeuralVDB will “soon” be available in beta: in the meantime a form on the official NeuralVDB webpage will allow you to register and get notified of upcoming updates.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC00MDcwLTItOC1naHotY2xvY2tzLTI4NXctdGdwLW1vcmUtdGZsb3BzLXRoYW4tcnR4LTMwOTAtdGkv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vbnZpZGlhLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTQwNzAtMi04LWdoei1jbG9ja3MtMjg1dy10Z3AtbW9yZS10ZmxvcHMtdGhhbi1ydHgtMzA5MC10aS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Allegedly Clocks Up To 2.8 GHz at 285W TGP More TFLOPs Than An RTX 3090 Ti,"Just yesterday we came to learn about a new spec of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card and it looks like Kopite7kimi has more information to share.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Graphics Card ""Rumored"" Specs: 7680 Cores 12 GB GDDR6X 285W TGP & More TFLOPs Than An RTX 3090 Ti

As per the previous rumor we came to know about a third spec change for the GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card which is expected to cost more or less the same as the RTX 3070. Previous rumors have positioned the card as a GeForce RTX 3090 Ti replacement at 1/4th the price ($2000 US MSRP). If that should be the case then the GeForce RTX 4070 has the potential to become a very popular graphics card in the $500 US category.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 'Expected' Specifications

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 is expected to utilize the full-fat AD104 GPU core with 7680 cores or 60 SM units. From previous leaks we also know that the AD104 GPU will come packed with 48 MB of L2 cache and up to 160 ROPs which is simply insane. That's a 25% increase in core count and a 12x increase in cache versus the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti which rocks the GA104 GPU core. The latest information reveals that the chip will have a base clock of 2310 MHz a boost clock of 2610 MHz & a maximum clock speed of up to 2800 MHz. That's over a 1.0 GHz clock difference between the RTX 4070 and RTX 3070 which is impressive but also expected considering NVIDIA is utilizing TSMC's 4N (optimized 5nm) process node for its Ada Lovelace GPUs.

At the maximum clock speed the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 should offer up to 43 TFLOPs of FP32 Compute horsepower which puts it ahead of NVIDIA's current fastest gaming GPU the RTX 3090 Ti. The RTX 3090 Ti features a maximum FP32 compute of 40 TFLOPs while the RTX 3070 features a 20 TFLOPs compute horsepower. That's a 7.5% increase versus the RTX 3090 Ti and a 2x increase over the RTX 3070.

As for memory specs the GeForce RTX 4070 is expected to rock 12 GB GDDR6X capacities that are said to be clocked at 21 Gbps speeds across a 192-bit bus interface for 504 GB/s bandwidth. As for power numbers the RTX 4070 is now rated at 285W TGP which is 65W higher than the TGP of the RTX 3070. The graphics card is expected to be based on the PG141-SKU331 PCB design.

Graphics card shipments are also expected to drop by up to 50% thanks to the recent cryptocurrency crash.

Intel expects to suffer a reduction of between $8 and $11 billion in revenue and has dropped its revenue goal to $65 - $68 billion. The company also estimates a 10% drop in PC sales (compared to 2021). This isn't that surprising — the COVID pandemic artificially boosted demand for computer products in 2021.

Nvidia also expects to take a big hit thanks to both the post-pandemic drop in demand and the major cryptocurrency crash earlier this year. Taiwanese graphics card suppliers estimate their 2022 shipments will fall by between 40 - 50% and sources cited by Digitimes say this will cause Nvidia's revenue to fall ""at a pace beyond imagination.""

Nvidia is also taking a big hit thanks to this issue as well as the major cryptocurrency crash this year. As a result Taiwanese graphics card suppliers have estimated their 2022 shipments will fall by around 40 - 50%. Sources say this will kill Nvidia's revenue throughout the whole year with an estimated fall ""beyond imagination"". Nvidia's preliminary Q2 revenue report released earlier this week showed a significantly worse quarter than projected.

The decline in demand for consumer tech is now affecting demand for less-important chip component manufacturers making display ICs panels and more. One such company notebook MCU and touchscreen controller manufacturer Elan Microelectronics expects a revenue drop of 30% this quarter.

Chromebook shipments are also expected to take a 50 - 60% hit in volume. Vendors such as Lenovo and HP both expect a 50 - 60% decline in shipments for their particular Chromebook models. Windows notebook and PC sales are expected to drop by 10% and 15% respectively throughout the year. Asus Dell Acer and HP are all having difficulty driving higher sales in the gaming and commercial notebook sectors.

AMD and Apple Are Doing Well

While other manufacturers are struggling to keep sales up AMD and Apple have somehow managed to circumvent these otherwise industry-wide problems.

AMD has seen massive growth: the company's Q2 revenue increased by 70% thanks to market share gains ""stolen"" from Intel in data center CPUs and embedded processor growth. (The acquisition of Xilinx has also helped AMD gain more market share revenue.)

But AMD has increased its expectations for shipment losses from 7 - 9% to 14 - 16%. That said AMD still expects its Q3 revenues to see a slight increase overall.

AMD's growth is largely thanks to Intel losing overall market share according to Digitimes' report. Intel still dominates almost 80% of the market but lost a ton of orders from Apple when the latter became its own CPU supplier (with the M1 and M2 ARM chips). AMD's rapid expansion in the data center as well as its revenue stream from Xilinx (which has enabled AMD to circumvent a lot of supply chain issues in 2022) have also contributed to Intel's troubles.

Apple has also been seeing incredible growth on the Macbook side — with a record-breaking 28 million units estimated to be sold in 2022."

Restricted chips from European and US companies have been found in military equipment being used by Russian forces in Ukraine.

Dual use devices that can be used for military designs have export restrictions imposed by the EU and US but there were also many mainstream microcontrollers and power devices used some of which were decades old but others used in modern military drones.

The report by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London found 318 components from 57 US companies the majority commodity parts from Analog Devices and Texas Instruments.

The detailed report is here

There were 57 from Japanese companies 18 from Swiss companies mainly STMicroelectronics and GLONASS navigation module u-blox as well as five from UK companies.

A total of 81 components found in Russian weapons systems are classified as dual-use goods with associated Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCN) from the Bureau of Industry and Security of the US Department of Commerce.

Silicon lifeline

The report calls for governments and companies to cut off this ‘silicon lifeline’ for producing new weapons systems but warns of unintended geopolitical consequences.

“Russia’s military power has been sustained by a silicon lifeline; one that runs from the US through the UK the Netherlands Germany Switzerland and France to Taiwan South Korea and Japan. Without that lifeline the Russian military will be destined to employ increasingly obsolescent technology without the means to deliver precision or efficiency on the battlefield” say the researchers.

“This may see Russia become increasingly dependent on China or its armaments. The critical question this report puts before Western policymakers is whether this silicon lifeline is to be cut and whether states are prepared to exploit the opportunities that severing it creates.”

“Many states had depended on Russia as an arms supplier. The assurance of those arms remains critical to their national security. For countries like India which sources 45% of its defence imports from Russia a loss of access to Russian equipment constitutes a security threat. This may encourage countries in this position to facilitate the evasion of sanctions” say the researchers.

“Alternatively since few countries in this position have large microelectronic industries it could be a catalyst to alter their suppliers. This presents opportunities for the Western alliance if it can bring constructive proposals to these states while avoiding an exploitative approach to foreign military sales. It could also significantly sour relations with several powerful countries if no constructive proposals are forthcoming while Western sanctions undermine national security.”

Weapons systems

The dataset acquired by RUSI covers 27 weapons systems platforms radios and pieces of equipment either captured or expended in Ukraine since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022 up until the end of June.

These systems include several long-range strike assets such as the 9M720 Iskander-M quasi-ballistic missile. It also includes tactical combat platforms such as the 9K331M Tor-M2 air-defence system and a variety of UAVs radio and satellite communication systems such as the R-168 Akveduk tactical radio as well as electronic warfare (EW) and signals intelligence (SIGINT) platforms.

For example the Tornado-S multiple rocket launcher battery uses a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) produced by Altera (part of Intel since 2016) with high speed SRAMs from Cypress Semiconductor (part of Infineon Technologies since 2021). FPGAs from Xilinx (now part of AMD) have also been found in military systems. Intel AMD and Infineon all stopped shipping part into Russia after the invasion of Ukraine.

Many of the controlled components were found in Russia’s most critical weapons systems such as the 9M549 300-mm GLONASS-guided rocket the Kh-59 anti-ship missile (AShM) and the R-330BMV EW system. The 9M549 rocket and Kh-59 contained flash memory and SRAM modules that are ECCN controlled.

The R-330BMV contained a variety of ECCN-controlled components including FPGAs CPLDs microprocessors digital signal processors and A/D converters. Other goods with an ECCN included Dutch semiconductors in the Kh-101 ALCM and a high-performance CMOS static RAM chip inside the 9M727 GLCM. Five separate ECCN components were also found in the Torn-MDM SIGINT system including Western-manufactured microcontrollers and RF amplifiers

CML Microcircuits and Golledge Electronics in Somerset UK are also cited in the report for crystal oscillators and timing circuits although Golledge is now part of the Dutch Techpoint group. Other Dutch semiconductor companies NXP and Nexperia are also cited for the microcontrollers and power devices respectively.

Clandestine procurement

The report highlights the challenges of a global supply chain for commodity semiconductors as well as for tracking the shipments of restricted devices.

The researchers point out that Russia has had a clandestine programme to acquire sensitive components for its military design for many years. Its FSB security agency the successor to the KGB has worked with companies in Hong Kong to supply devices.

“Much of Russia’s procurement of Western microelectronics for military purposes involved the use of false end-user certificates front companies and trans-shipments” say the researchers.

Industry response

The parts were shipped legally via distribution before sanctions were imposed earlier this year say suppliers.

“Microchip is a leading provider of smart connected and secure embedded control solutions with more than 120000 customers across the industrial automotive consumer aerospace and defense communications and computing markets” said the company. “Distributors also sell our products into the marketplace. We take our responsibility as a good corporate citizen seriously. In compliance with export laws and because actions by Russia against the Ukraine are in opposition to our Guiding Values Microchip ceased shipments to customers in Russia Belarus and sanctioned regions in the Ukraine.”

“Our products have many possible customer applications. Microchip sells such products in compliance with applicable laws including export controls and trade sanctions” it said. “At this time we are unable to review all sales transactions related to the products in question. Microchip takes care to maintain supply chain integrity by various methods including screening its customers against restricted party lists. Without access to specific devices we are unable to advise whether they are Microchip products and if Microchip products how they ended up in a particular product or application.”

“We have been aware since 2018 that u–blox modules were found in Russian military drones” said u-blox. “These products were sold to a civilian customer by our Eastern European distributor in 2015 long before sanctions were imposed on Russia.”

“As the market leader for positioning technologies we see it as our duty to prevent the misuse of our products for military purposes. We stick by a clear policy since our foundation that our solutions are not to be used in weapons – whether civilian military or weapon systems for target identifications. Our global sales teams and distributors are contractually obligated to strictly adhere to these restrictions and must follow this directive. Apart from the case mentioned we are not aware of any military use of our products nor would any use be authorized by us.”

“We strongly condemn the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and immediately stopped all exports to Russia Belarus and the territories occupied by Russia in Ukraine as soon as the war began.”

“Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and in compliance with US and EU sanctions Analog Devices ceased business activities in Russia and promptly instructed all of its distributors to halt shipments of our products into Russia. Any post-sanctions shipments into Russia would be in direct violation of ADI’s express instructions. We take this matter seriously and would be interested to investigate any and all information related to any possible distributors who may have violated our express instructions” said a spokesperson for Analog Devices.

Over 50 unique components from TI were discovered in several Russian systems including digital signal processors found in various computing and processing modules in the 9M727 land-attack cruise missile a CAN transceiver found in the electronic detonator of the KUB-BLA ‘kamikaze’ UAV power management modules in an E95M target drone and in the Orlan-10 UAV as well as audio codecs and converters in several of the radio sets used by the Russian Army.

“At least 10 of the Texas Instrument components discovered in these weapon platforms are under US export controls. This includes the TMS320 C25GBA and TMS320 C30GEL digital signal processors both present in the 9M727 GLCM.73” says the report.

Texas Instruments told the Reuters news agency it had conducted “an in-depth review” and found that 36 shipments by the company and six by one of its authorized distributors that arrived in Russia in late February and early March were in transit before the invasion began.

“We stand behind our earlier statement that we are not selling into Russia … and comply with applicable laws and regulations in the countries where we operate” it said.

“We suspended all shipments to and business with customers in Russia since the end of February and Belarus since early March” said NXP in a statement. “We are now in the process of ceasing our operations in Russia and continue to comply fully with applicable measures and sanctions.”

Liberty Live Church which holds services at Smithfield High School on weekends is looking to construct its own building.

Timmons Group a Virginia Beach-based engineering firm has requested a special use permit on behalf of Louis and Un Chon Kil Ramos of Yorktown to construct a roughly 30000-square-foot building on 6 acres behind the town’s Dollar Tree and O’Reilly Auto Parts stores.

Access to the church would be via a cul-de-sac on Wimbledon Lane. The church would include roughly 500 seats and 227 parking spaces. According to the application the church would be used primarily on Sunday mornings for services at 9 a.m. and 10:45 a.m. and on Wednesday evenings for youth group meetings.

Smithfield’s Planning Commission voted unanimously on Aug. 9 following a public hearing to give the requested permit their favorable recommendation. The matter will next head to Smithfield’s Town Council for another public hearing and a final vote.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vbmoxMDE1LmNvbS9wcm9wb3NlZC1ob21lbGVzcy1zaGVsdGVyLWluLWZsZW1pbmd0b24tbmotaGFzLXBlb3BsZS1mdW1pbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Proposed homeless shelter in Flemington has people fuming,"This is one of those moments that should make you stare deep into your soul.

People in Flemington were expected to pack a public meeting Tuesday night over a proposed homeless shelter in a nice residential neighborhood.

The house at 8 New York Ave. is owned by the Cavalry Episcopal Church and at present is used for Sunday school classes and office space.

But Family Promise is a nonprofit that wants to convert the house into a homeless shelter for displaced families.

More than 30 years ago people of different faiths from Hunterdon County churches formed a group to provide temporary housing for homeless folks and they’ve been doing that at a facility in surrounding Raritan Township. Now they want a land use variance in order to use the building on New York Avenue in the middle of a quiet residential neighborhood to house more people.

Some neighbors aren’t having it. Signs reading STOP THE SHELTER have gone up on lawns. People are nervous and angry. The meeting Tuesday night was expected to be so heavily attended they were holding it not at the borough hall but on Stangl Road at a place normally serving as a farmer’s market.

Family Promise says its “proposed supervised transitional housing for children and families experiencing homelessness satisfies a desperate need of the County of Hunterdon.”

They’re not wrong. According to MyCentralJersey.com they are the only homeless shelter serving the entire county. Which happens to be one of the richest counties in the country but that doesn’t mean there aren’t unfortunate souls who fall on bleak times. What are they to do?

Yet I also understand the fear of those fighting against it. I’m sure they’re greatly concerned about their property values. It’s likely they’re worried about potential problems being caused by homeless people in the place they raise their kids.

Family Promise says the stories of those who needed their services are heartbreaking. On their website they share this video of some of them telling their tales.

I understand the neighbors complaining about the project are just looking out for their own families. But isn’t there something to be said for society looking out for each other too? How do you turn your back on people facing this?

Hard questions with no easy answers. And answers will have to wait more weeks. At the last minute Tuesday night a postponement was called until Sept. 13 due to the attorney for Family Promise falling ill according to former Flemington councilman Joey Novick.

The stop the shelter signs will stay up until then and people facing desperate nights will no doubt have more of them.

But Hailie Deegan‘s presence in the story means people notice.

It may be nothing more than breaking up the monotony of a drawn-out season to see if changes in chemistry can improve results and it comes at a point at which there’s little risk of harm.

Nevertheless it’s an intriguing development because Deegan garners attention disproportionate to her performance. Naturally people are curious about what the change says about her future.

Hailie Deegan and Tanner Gray are switching truck series crew chiefs

Drivers Halie Deegan and Tanner Gray will trade veteran crew chiefs beginning this weekend at Richmond Raceway for the second round of the NASCAR Truck Series playoffs David Gilliland Racing announced.

Jerry Baxter the crew chief for the Cup Series cars of Bubba Wallace and Erik Jones the past two seasons will begin working with Deegan atop the pit box of the No. 1 Ford team. Mike Hillman Jr. who has been with Deegan since the start of last season will now work with Gray and the No. 15 Ford team.

Baxter has worked 481 races across the three major NASCAR series. The first of his 18 victories came with Boris Said in the only 1998 truck race he worked. He’s helped Wallace Christopher Bell and Brett Moffitt to third-place series finishes in trucks since 2014.

Hillman has logged 456 races as a crew chief primarily in the trucks series where he has recorded 23 wins. The first five victories came with Todd Bodine in 2005. In fact Hillman’s first 19 victories and both series championships came with Bodine.

Hailie Deegan’s season has been a disappointment

Hailie Deegan began the 2022 truck series season speaking of her desire to move up to rides in the Xfinity Series this season or next at the latest. Instead it’s fair to ask whether she merits hanging on to her ride with David Gilliland Racing beyond November.

Though there’s a case she mostly got caught in messes made by other people Deegan had three of her first seven races end in crashes. She didn’t finish better than 17th until the 11th race. That race was one of four over a seventh-race stretch in which she’s finished between 10th and 15th offering some semblance of hope.

Deegan is 21st in points with six races remaining in her second season and would need a superb late-season run just to climb to 17th where she finished last season.

Tanner Gray’s third season hasn’t been remarkably better but he is 14th in points which is a four-spot improvement from a year ago.

Is NASCAR’s best-known female driver at risk of losing her ride?

Female drivers remain a rarity in motorsports – ESPN offered a good read about W Series star Jamie Chadwick this week – and even the good ones have trouble moving up the ranks.

Hailie Deegan 21 hasn’t distinguished herself in the NASCAR truck series which is a proving ground for moving up to the Xfinity Series cars that are closer to the Next Gen cars of the Cup Series the ultimate goal.

David Gilliland Racing has been operating since 2018 but has yet to have a trucks driver finish better than eighth in the standings. That’s a clue Deegan hasn’t been running with the best combination of equipment and personnel despite the exposure that goes with being one of those rare female drivers.

Does she merit a third crack at the truck series in 2023?

That’s not the right question to ask. Rather will Monster Energy and her other sponsors stand behind Deegan? If the answer is yes then there really is nothing to read into the swap of crew chiefs this year and she will be back next year.

The bet here is she does return. However that goal of advancing to Xfinity Series racing shouldn’t materialize anytime soon.

A listing for the property describes it as a ""19th century block"" building that was constructed in the Civil War era with ""historically significant façade cornice and windows.""

The CVS store at the site went out of business on November 12. Before CVS acquired the business a Hamlin's Red Cross Drug Store had operated there since 1924.

The Pyramid Brokerage Company listing shows the asking price for the property as $875000. That's significantly less than the price some downtown business owners had been told CVS was originally seeking.

The listing indicates the building has about 15000 square feet of space. The available property includes a total of five parcels. It includes a parking lot with entrances off Hawley and Washington streets.

OXY,Occidental Petroleum,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vY29sb3JhZG9zdW4uY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMTEvYnJvbmNvLWNhcC1jb2xvcmFkby1vaWwtZ2FzLWRyaWxsaW5nLXJ1bGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First comprehensive oil and gas drilling plan under Colorado's new regulations gets go-ahead,"Colorado’s first comprehensive oil and gas development plan — a new mechanism aimed at better assessing and managing the cumulative impacts of drilling — was approved by state regulators Wednesday paving the way for more than 200 new wells in Weld County.

Kerr-McGee a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corp. got a greenlight from Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission for its Bronco Comprehensive Area Plan. The company will have six years under the plan to drill its wells.

The comprehensive area plans or CAPs were added to COGCC rules as part of the mandate under Senate Bill 181 for the commission to focus on protecting public health safety welfare and the environment and wildlife.

“The goal of the CAPS is to incentivize a holistic approach to development” commission spokeswoman Megan Castle said.

“It is a good planning tool for the operators for the state and localities” said Lynn Granger executive director of the industry trade group API-Colorado. “It provides some level of certainty for everyone involved.”

Environmental and community groups have pressed for a broader evaluation of impacts of oil and gas activities saying that the commission’s approvals of individual projects fail to capture the pile-on impacts of drilling in a local area or region.

The groups however contend that the comprehensive plans being filed provide only a limited view of impacts while potentially opening thousands of acres to oil and gas drilling.

“The data in the CAPs was supposed to inform new rules on cumulative impacts but there are real questions about the data” said Kate Merlin an attorney with the environmental group WildEarth Guardians. “If we can’t rely on the data how can we rely on the rules to protect us?”

The plans also are ushering in more sources of pollution when the Front Range is already struggling with significant air pollution problems said JoAnn Hackos vice president of the Audubon Colorado Council.

In addition to Kerr-McGee Civitas Resources and PDC Energy have submitted comprehensive plans. The three plans total more than 820 wells across 94000 acres.

Kerr-McGee’s Bronco CAP projects drilling 209 wells on a 24333-acre area in Weld County centered around the Cervi Ranch. The drilling area is bounded on the north by U.S. 34 west of the town of Dearfield and the on south by Interstate 76 near Roggen.

The approval was delayed a week after it was criticized by oil and gas commissioners at an Aug. 3 hearing. Commissioner Karin McGowan scored what she called “squishy” language in the plan.

The initial plan for example said existing old wells would be “evaluated” for plugging and “to the greatest extent possible” gathering lines would follow roads.

Invoking Star Wars McGowan said “I joke about Yoda but he did say it best ‘Do or do not do there is no try.’”

In the revised plan Kerr-McGee committed to plugging wells running gathering lines along roads using pipelines to carry waste water away from drill sites and several other actions that had been tentative.

It also sharply cut its estimated air emissions by switching to natural gas-powered drill rigs using less polluting diesel engines and cutting truck traffic.

CAP was supposed to help get a handle on emissions

In its April draft of the CAP the company estimated in the first five years emissions of nitrogen oxides would total nearly 1400 tons and methane emissions would be 240 tons. In the final plan that was down to 389 tons of NOx which contributes to ozone pollution and 143 tons of methane a powerful greenhouse gas.

Brett Ackerman the commissioner with a wildlife and environment background pressed for the CAP to note that the best management for wildlife during migratory or mating periods is shutting or limiting operations — so-called timing stipulations.

“Timing stipulations are the best management practice in the pronghorn area” Akerman said. There are also two bald eagle winter nesting areas with a mile of the CAP.

Jamie Jost Kerr-McGee’s attorney however pushed back on including the language in the plan saying that the company was in the process of developing a 30-page comprehensive wildlife management plan for the area with Colorado Parks and Wildlife.

The comprehensive plan was expected to identify the specific drilling areas within the plan area and that the whole region and each of the sites would be evaluated together. That would clear the way for an operator to seek drilling permits.

Kerr-McGee’s plan however calls for identifying 11 drill sites later and the company will then seek commission approval for oil and gas development plans for each site. “I don’t think that was the intent of the rules” Commissioner John Messner said.

The next CAP up for review will be Civitas Resources’ Box Elder CAP followed by PDC Energy’s Guanella CAP with a projected 466 wells at 25 locations on 32640 acres southwest of Greeley. The comment period on Guanella is open until Oct. 1.

The Box Elder CAP is already drawing criticism from environmental groups. The plan calls for 151 wells on 20 drill sites across 37520 acres in Adams and Arapahoe counties and Aurora.

While compared to the more limited cumulative impacts data in the Bronco CAP the data in the Civitas plan is “elegantly packaged and extraordinarily long” according to Merlin from WildEarth Guardians. The emissions and impacts report runs 483 pages.

Still in comments filed with the COGCC Merlin said that inconsistencies in the data raise questions about the confidence of the analysis.

For example a Civitas consultant monitored releases off existing company sites and found next to no emissions but ambient air monitors operated by Front Range communities detect both background levels and spikes of chemicals linked to oil and gas operations.

“How can their monitors not even pick-up the background levels?” Merlin asked.

The Civitas air quality study in Broomfield focused on taking measures as the wind blew across the company’s location toward monitors said Brian Cain the company’s chief sustainability officer.

“The goal of this study was not simply to detect methane or other air constituents in the community but to detect and understand any emissions that could be coming specifically from our locations” Cain said.

Civitas has already installed more than 100 air monitors in the Box Elder CAP reporting to the Colorado Air Pollution Control Division Cain said. The monitors will provide an air quality baseline for the area.

As a result of the sprawl of the plan the Box Elder CAP will have impacts on burrowing owls and other wildlife as well as people living in low-income and minority communities said Hackos from Audubon.

“The plan certainly gives us plenty of things to evaluate but what we are concerned about is that they will just pass everything and we’ll have hundreds more wells” Hacko said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvYXJtaWUtaGFtbWVyLWV4ZXMtc3BlYWstb3V0LWluLW5ldy1kb2N1c2VyaWVzLXRyYWlsZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Armie Hammer's Exes Speak Out in New Docuseries Trailer,"A new three-part docuseries is analyzing the allegations against Armie Hammer and the purported generations of abuse present in his family tree.

On Wednesday discovery+ debuted the first trailer for House of Hammer the upcoming doc that ""chronicles the deeply troubling accusations leveled against critically acclaimed actor Armie Hammer and the dark twisted legacy of the Hammer dynasty"" per a press release.

In the trailer two of Hammer's exes who have previously come forward Courtney Vucekovich and Julia Morrison recount their past experiences with Hammer 35 and share troubling text messages and voice notes they say they got from the actor.

For more on Armie Hammer listen below to our daily podcast PEOPLE Every Day.

""In the beginning I felt like this was all perfect; this was amazing"" says Vucekovich as both women claimed he would love-bomb them with compliments. ""But then things changed. He pushes your boundaries a little bit at a time"" added Vucekovich. ""You're his completely. ... I mean he said 'I'm 100 percent a cannibal. I'm freaking out.""

Morrison claimed ""It was all he wanted to ever talk about.""

Vucekovich said Hammer would become ""mad"" and also tied her up until she was ""completely immobilized."" Through tears she added ""I was closing my eyes until it ended.""

The docuseries looks into Hammer's affluent family's history as well. The actor's aunt Casey Hammer — who previously spoke to Vanity Fair for the 2021 exposé ""The Fall of Armie Hammer: A Family Saga of Sex Money Drugs and Betrayal"" — appears in the series sharing the ""dark twisted secrets of the Hammer family"" and comparing it to Succession magnified ""a million times."" (The star's dad is Michael Armand Hammer who is the grandson of oil magnate Armand Hammer who ran Occidental Petroleum Corporation.)

Said Casey in the trailer ""When all of this came out about Armie I was not shocked. You just don't wake up and become this dark controller abuser. This behavior is deep-rooted.""

A rep for Hammer did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.

Elizabeth Chambers who shares two kids with Hammer filed for divorce in July 2020 citing irreconcilable differences. Months later Hammer was embroiled in controversy after messages allegedly from the actor detailing violent sexual fantasies were leaked online. He was later accused of rape which he denied.

A lawyer for Hammer Andrew Brettler previously said in a statement to Vanity Fair: ""All interactions between Mr. Hammer and his former partners were consensual. They were fully discussed agreed upon in advance with his partners and mutually participatory. The stories perpetuated on social media were designed to be salacious in an effort to harm Mr. Hammer but that does not make them true.""

A source told PEOPLE in February that Hammer has been focusing more on his kids since leaving a treatment facility for drug alcohol and sex issues. His ""main priority is to be sober and stay sober for the kids and Elizabeth"" the insider said. ""They're co-parenting effectively and they're very much intertwined in each other's lives.""

""The accusations of rape and abuse brought against Armie Hammer in the last few years are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the Hammer family. With House of Hammer we witness truly disturbing details and sinister secrets that money and power couldn't hide forever"" Jason Sarlanis president of Crime and Investigative Content Linear and Streaming said in a statement. ""This documentary provides an important platform for the incredibly courageous women who came forward to share their stories and we hope their courage inspires others to continue meaningful conversations around abuse in our society.""

House of Hammer will be available to stream Friday Sept. 2 on discovery+.

Berkshire Hathaway is one of the world’s top investment vehicles a virtual cornucopia of public and private companies that are among the biggest and best in the world. Typically Warren Buffett is a fan of buying companies he can understand. One thing he clearly understands now is that while a “green environment” is something all of us would like to see the reality is that demand and the need for oil and petroleum-based products is not going away anytime soon.

Over the past year Berkshire Hathaway has been buying the shares of Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: OXY) and as of this week the “Oracle of Omaha” has amassed a stunning 20% of the company. Berkshire Hathaway now owns 188366460 shares of the stock and it is a good bet that Buffett could add more. The main point is that with over $11 billion invested in the stock clearly he and those making investment decisions at his firm think the price of oil is going higher and demand will remain strong.

Given this huge position and the prospects for the oil industry going forward as well as the fact that West Texas Intermediate crude has dropped 30% from the intraday highs printed in March earlier this year it makes sense for investors to own stock in the sector especially when the companies pay large and dependable dividends.

We found eight stocks rated Buy across Wall Street that are solid ideas for growth and income investors now. It is important to remember that no single analyst report should be used as a sole basis for any buying or selling decision.



BP

This is one of the premier European integrated oil giants and Goldman Sachs analysts are quite positive on the shares. BP PLC (NYSE: BP) engages in the energy business worldwide.

These eight energy sector giants can continue to profit from elevated energy prices and offer investors who are more conservative a way to play the sector. With everything from the world’s largest integrated energy giants to one of the biggest refining companies these are eight ways to generate income and participate in the ongoing biggest rally in the energy and oil space since 2011.

Note that all these companies posted some of the biggest profits in the second quarter of any sector. While some may howl and scream about windfall profits taxes nobody stepped in when oil plunged to under $20 a barrel in April of 2020 when Exxon lost $20 billion and when oil futures were literally trading negative.

The organization also known as NOVA Parks released its five-year strategic plan on Tuesday. The plan includes proposed upgrades to Arlington’s section of the Washington & Old Dominion (W&OD) Trail including the addition of a dual-use trail.

Sometimes called “the skinniest park in Virginia” the old railroad-turned-trail actually starts in Arlington with mile marker zero in Green Valley near the intersection of S. Four Mile Run Drive and Shirlington Road. It extends about five miles running northwest through the county to Benjamin Banneker Park continuing into Falls Church and beyond.

About 2 to 3 million people use the trail each year.

NOVA Parks says it is aiming to “design and expand the capacity of the W&OD Trail in congested urban areas” including the Arlington section of the trail. That could mean a widening of the trail.

The design work for this expansion is expected to be completed within the next two years per the plan. The work will be done in collaboration with the Northern Virginia Transportation Authority.

Plans will also be developed for sections of dual trail along the W&OD in Arlington like what was completed in Falls Church last fall. Dual trails allow for separate pathways for bicyclists and pedestrians.

The idea was first brought up at the Falls Church ribbon-cutting in October 2021 and was embraced by many who bike run and walk on the trail which can get crowded during peak usage times.

There was some opposition to expanding the trail however including from current County Board candidate Audrey Clement who decried a “massive uprooting of vegetation” and runoff from additional paved surfaces.

NOVA Parks Executive Director Paul Gilbert told ARLnow in an email that there’s grant money available to design something in Arlington that is similar to what’s now in Falls Church.

“The goal would be to do like we did in Falls Church and where possible separate cyclists from walkers with parallel paths” Gilbert said. “There may be areas where we just have room to make the single existing trail a little wider and other areas where users can have separate paths.”

In terms of when this might be built that’s not clear with design work still needing to be completed. The hope is to bring those designs back to the community for feedback by 2024 and begin construction “when permits are approved.”

Overall NOVA Parks is pledging to spend more than $6 million on creating and improving trails across the region over the next 5 years.

As the only regional park authority in Virginia NOVA Parks encompasses 34 parks and manages 12335 acres of land in six Northern Virginia jurisdictions including Alexandria the City of Fairfax Falls Church Fairfax County Loudoun and Arlington.

The strategic plan also promises a number of improvements big-ticket projects and expansion of Northern Virginia parkland over the next half-decade.

NOVA Parks is committing to planting 50000 more trees restoring native plantings to at least ten new areas reducing parks’ carbon footprint by 2% and expanding solar energy to three additional parks all by 2027. The plan is also to start introducing electrical vehicles and mowers into its fleet by 2024.

Additionally there are several big money items on the agenda. NOVA Parks is looking to acquire at least five new properties by 2027 as well as build a W&OD Trail Visitors Center.

The center is likely to be built in Loudoun County Gilbert told ARLnow near where a trail maintenance facility is currently located.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vdmlyZ2luaWFtZXJjdXJ5LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzExL3Rob3VzYW5kcy1vZi1sb3ctaW5jb21lLXZpcmdpbmlhbnMtc2V0LXRvLWdldC1hY2Nlc3MtdG8tc2hhcmVkLXNvbGFyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Thousands of low-income Virginians set to get access to shared solar • Virginia Mercury,"Over 4500 low- and moderate-income families in Virginia that were previously unable to source their electricity from solar panels will soon have access to the technology.

On Tuesday Dimension Renewable Energy and Community Housing Partners announced they are partnering to offer shared solar to residents of the housing nonprofit’s more than 70 affordable apartment communities in Virginia.

The agreement marks some of the earliest movement in Virginia’s nascent community solar industry which began developing in the wake of a 2020 law.

“All of our residents that are in the Dominion Energy footprint are eligible” said Michael Sutphin communications manager for Community Housing Partners.

Community solar called shared solar in Virginia is a form of small-scale solar development that allows multiple households to draw power from an array often sited nearby.

Renewables advocates say shared solar is necessary to increase access to the technology which under net metering arrangements with utility companies can drive down customers’ electricity bills.

Besides price barriers households can be blocked from installing rooftop solar if their roof can’t support panels if their lot is too shady or if they live in a multi-family structure like an apartment building.

Janaka Casper CEO of Community Housing Partners in a press release announcing the partnership called shared solar “another way for us to help low-income families in a responsible climate-friendly way.”

Power will be drawn from eight Dimension solar installations around Virginia: the Suffolk project in Suffolk the Halifax project in South Boston the Prince Edwards project in Pamplin the Augusta project in Augusta the White Stone Ocran project in White Stone the Waynesboro Bridge project in Waynesboro the Fairfield Lee project in Fairfield and the recently approved Pittsylvania CSG project in Chatham.

For years shared solar wasn’t an option for Virginia customers. Despite 2017 legislation requiring Dominion and Appalachian Power to develop community solar pilots Dominion didn’t open its program to customers until this May; today subscribers must pay a premium for their participation. Appalachian Power has chosen a solar project for its pilot but spokesperson Teresa Hall said the installation only came online this June “and as a result our pilot program isn’t in place just yet.”

“We are fully dedicated and our goal is to get it implemented over the next few months” she wrote in an email.

In 2020 with little progress apparent Sen. Scott Surovell D-Fairfax and then-Del. Jay Jones D-Norfolk put forward legislation requiring Dominion to develop a program where interested customers could get power from small arrays — defined as those with a capacity of no more than 5 megawatts — developed by non-utility companies. Separate legislation ordered the creation of a shared solar program for multifamily residences like apartment buildings in Dominion and Old Dominion Power territory.

During hearings Dominion argued that because participating customers would pay less for electricity non-participating customers would have to pay more to ensure the utility could recoup its operating costs.

Ultimately a provision was added to the shared solar bill requiring state regulators to set a “minimum bill” for shared solar customers that would “ensure subscribing customers pay a fair share of the costs of providing electric services” and “minimize the costs shifted to customers not in a shared solar program.”

After months of wrangling the State Corporation Commission this July agreed to set the minimum bill at $55.10 an amount that community solar groups say would be the highest such charge in the country and would make the program so expensive as to be useless.

Crucially however one group is exempted from the minimum bill: low-income customers who must make up at least 30% of shared solar subscribers and are the primary group served by Community Housing Partners.

The nonprofit estimates that customers who sign up for shared solar through the Dimension partnership could see a 10% decrease in their monthly electric bill.

Charlie Coggeshall director of policy and regulatory affairs for the Coalition for Community Solar Access said that because the $55.10 minimum bill “makes the economics extremely challenging” for developers low-income projects “might be the only way” to offer shared solar in Virginia.

That “is not a bad thing but (it’s) not necessarily what was envisioned by the legislation” he said.

Households interested in shared solar won’t be able to enroll in a program until July 1 2023 or whenever Dominion completes development of a new customer information system.

An electrical engineer explains how these critical electronic components work and how they ...,"Semiconductors are a critical part of almost every modern electronic device and the vast majority of semiconductors are made in Tawain. Increasing concerns over the reliance on Taiwan for semiconductors – especially given the tenuous relationship between Taiwan and China – led the U.S. Congress to pass the CHIPS and Science act in late July 2022. The act provides more than US$50 billion in subsidies to boost U.S. semiconductor production and has been widely covered in the news. Trevor Thornton an electrical engineer who studies semiconductors explains what these devices are and how they are made.

1. What is a semiconductor?

Generally speaking the term semiconductor refers to a material – like silicon – that can conduct electricity much better than an insulator such as glass but not as well as metals like copper or aluminum. But when people are talking about semiconductors today they are usually referring to semiconductor chips.

These chips are typically made from thin slices of silicon with complex components laid out on them in specific patterns. These patterns control the flow of current using electrical switches – called transistors – in much the same way you control the electrical current in your home by flipping a switch to turn on a light.

The difference between your house and a semiconductor chip is that semiconductor switches are entirely electrical – no mechanical components to flip – and the chips contain tens of billions of switches in an area not much larger than the size of a fingernail.

2. What do semiconductors do?

Semiconductors are how electronic devices process store and receive information. For instance memory chips store data and software as binary code digital chips manipulate the data based on the software instructions and wireless chips receive data from high-frequency radio transmitters and convert them into electrical signals. These different chips work together under the control of software. Different software applications perform very different tasks but they all work by switching the transistors that control the current.

3. How do you build a semiconductor chip?

The starting point for the vast majority of semiconductors is a thin slice of silicon called a wafer. Today’s wafers are the size of dinner plates and are cut from single silicon crystals. Manufacturers add elements like phosphorus and boron in a thin layer at the surface of the silicon to increase the chip’s conductivity. It is in this surface layer where the transistor switches are made.

The transistors are built by adding thin layers of conductive metals insulators and more silicon to the entire wafer sketching out patterns on these layers using a complicated process called lithography and then selectively removing these layers using computer-controlled plasmas of highly reactive gases to leave specific patterns and structures. Because the transistors are so small it is much easier to add materials in layers and then carefully remove unwanted material than it is to place microscopically thin lines of metal or insulators directly onto the chip. By depositing patterning and etching layers of different materials dozens of times semiconductor manufacturers can create chips with tens of billions of transistors per square inch.

4. How are chips today different from the early chips?

There are many differences but the most important is probably the increase in the number of transistors per chip.

Among the earliest commercial applications for semiconductor chips were pocket calculators which became widely available in the 1970s. These early chips contained a few thousand transistors. In 1989 Intel introduced the the first semiconductors to exceed a million transistors on a single chip. Today the largest chips contain more than 50 billion transistors. This trend is described by what is known as Moore’s law which says that the number of transistors on a chip will double approximately every 18 months.

Moore’s law has held up for five decades. But in recent years the semiconductor industry has had to overcome major challenges – mainly how to continue shrinking the size of transistors – to continue this pace of advancement.

One solution was to switch from flat two-dimensional layers to three-dimensional layering with fin-shaped ridges of silicon projecting up above the surface. These 3D chips significantly increased the number of transistors on a chip and are now in widespread use but they’re also much more difficult to manfacture.

5. Do more complicated chips require more sophisticated factories?

Simply put yes the more complicated the chip the more complicated – and more costly – the factory.

There was a time when almost every U.S. semiconductor company built and maintained its own factories. But today a new foundry can cost more than $10 billion to build. Only the largest companies can afford that kind of investment. Instead the majority of semiconductor companies send their designs to independent foundries for manufacturing. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and GlobalFoundries headquartered in New York are two examples of multinational foundries that build chips for other companies. They have the expertise and economies of scale to invest in the hugely expensive technology required to produce next-generation semiconductors.

Ironically while the transistor and semiconductor chip were invented in the U.S. no state-of-the-art semiconductor foundries are currently on American soil. The U.S. has been here before in the 1980s when there were concerns that Japan would dominate the global memory business. But with the newly passed CHIPS act Congress has provided the incentives and opportunities for next-generation semiconductors to be manufactured in the U.S.

“It is unlikely that Beijing will take serious trade actions against electronic exports from Taiwan. Doing so would be China shooting itself in its own foot” Dexter Roberts a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council told VOA.

Taiwan makes 65% of the world’s semiconductors and almost 90% of the advanced chips.

By comparison China produces a little over 5% while the U.S. produces approximately 10% according to market analysts. South Korea Japan and the Netherlands are the other sources of the product which is at the heart of many electronic devices and machinery.

Though China produces some semiconductors it depends heavily on supplies from Taiwan for advanced chips. Taiwan’s TSMC makes most of the advanced chips in the world and counts Advanced Micro Devices Apple and Nvidia among its customers.

Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC) in China which has 5% of the global fabrication market produces 14-nanometer chips. There is also evidence that SMIC has 7-nm technology according to a TechInsights blog. These are considered less advanced than the 3-nm chips produced by TSMC.

Beijing may not block the flow of semiconductors even if the military confrontation escalates analysts say.

“Taiwan-based TSMC is the biggest world producer of chips and China and the rest of the world need TSMC semiconductors. Hence I don’t expect China to target electronic exports” said Lourdes Casanova Gail and Rob Canizares director of the Emerging Markets Institute at Cornell University.

Though China’s People’s Liberation Army says it is rehearsing to impose a military blockade around Taiwan it will be careful not to hurt semiconductor companies like TSMC Casanova said.

“The stoppage of supply of TSMC semiconductors would be the worst scenario for China and for many other countries. TSMC’s semiconductors are used by Foxconn another Taiwanese firm which is the main manufacturer of the iPhone in plants based in China and elsewhere” she said.

Fear of invasion

A military invasion of Taiwan could disrupt supplies of semiconductors and seriously hamper dozens of high-tech companies that depend on them. TSMC Chairman Mark Liu voiced that fear when he said a military invasion would make TSMC factories inoperable.

“Our interruption would create great economic turmoil in China — suddenly their most advanced component supply disappears. It is an interruption I must say so people will think twice on this” Liu said.

“Nobody can control TSMC by force ... because it is a sophisticated manufacturing facility that depends on the real-time connection with the outside world” such as Europe the U.S. and Japan for materials chemicals and engineering software he said.

Even with China’s ban on certain imports from Taiwan analysts said Taiwan is unlikely to retaliate because it is heavily dependent on Beijing in terms of trade and investment.

“Companies like TSMC are deeply reliant simultaneously on both the U.S. and China markets. Unless the situation in the Taiwan Strait badly deteriorates and turns to outright open hostilities Taiwan will try to avoid taking any drastic action which would be cutting off chips to China” said Roberts author of The Myth of Chinese Capitalism.

China’s domestic manufacturing

China has been pushing to boost its domestic semiconductor manufacturing capacity. Beijing has pledged $150 billion to expand the industry and be more self-reliant. Plans are in place for new semiconductor factories.

Just last year China’s chip manufacturing grew by 33.3% according to China’s National Bureau of Statistics.

“China’s rapid growth in semiconductor chip sales is likely to continue due in large part to the unwavering commitment from the central government and robust policy support in the face of deteriorating U.S-China relations” the Semiconductor Industry Association said in a blog.

Much of what will be produced in China is expected to be chips containing more mature technologies analysts say.

US action

Under President Joe Biden the U.S. has intensified efforts to strengthen its chip-making capabilities and reduce the reliance on external sources.

On Tuesday Biden signed the much-awaited CHIPS and Science Act which allocates around $52 billion to promote the production of microchips the powerful driver for high-end electronics used in a wide range of products including smartphones electric vehicles aircraft and military hardware.

Biden said the legislation would help “win the economic competition in the 21st century.”

U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said last month that it was necessary to reduce the dependence on supplies from Taiwan.

“Our dependence on Taiwan for chips is untenable and unsafe” she said on July 22. “This is a Sputnik moment for America” Raimondo said referring to the CHIPS Act. “I mean that very sincerely. And this is a project we’re working on.”

Taiwan’s TSMC website states it is building a fabrication plant in the U.S. state of Arizona with the aim of starting production in 2024. It will produce semiconductor wafers using 5-nm technology. During her recent controversial visit to Taiwan Pelosi met TSMC's Liu. TSMC is expected to be one of the beneficiaries of the $52 billion CHIPS and Science Act.

The U.S. is also countering China’s semiconductor industry in different ways. It recently broadened its ban on sales of chip-making equipment to China according to Tim Archer the chief executive officer of Lam Research Corp. a California supplier of silicon wafer fabrication gear.

The restriction would affect the shipment of machinery to produce 14 nm chips in China. This is an extension of the earlier ban which prevented the supply of machinery for making advanced technology nodes of 10 nanometers. The idea is to cover a wider range of semiconductor equipment going to China.

South Korea a U.S. ally has indicated it would also cut off the chip supply to China in case Washington imposed global sanctions on it. Cutting off supplies would put China and Russia at a major technological disadvantage and hamper their manufacture of advanced military hardware.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV0ZnN0cmVhbS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvd29yc3Qtb2Ytc2VsbC1vZmYtaW4tc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3Rvci1ldGZzLW1heS1iZS1vdmVy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Worst of sell-off in semiconductor ETFs may be over,"Although tensions between the US and China over Taiwan are increasing short-term uncertainty for investors in semiconductor ETFs there is reason to believe bigger concerns about the economic outlook are already priced in.

It was only a few months ago that semiconductor ETFs were riding high on a wave of post-pandemic demand and a chip supply shortage.

That changed as investors began worrying that the Federal Reserve’s war on inflation – sparked in part by the chip shortage that delayed shipments of automobiles and computers – might cause a recession and dent demand for semiconductors.

As a result the three biggest semiconductor ETFs in Europe – the VanEck Semiconductor UCITS ETF (SMH) the Lyxor MSCI Semiconductors ESG Filtered UCITS ETF (SEMG) and the iShares MSCI Global Semiconductors UCITS ETF (SEME) – are all down over 15% this year as at 9 August.

In recent weeks these ETFs began recouping losses and seem to generally have shrugged at this week’s rising worries over Taiwan where most of the world’s chips are made. It is also home to the biggest fabricator Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing which is the top holding in VanEck’s offering.

Recession gigger worry than Taiwan

The semiconductor ETFs haven’t been moving much on the Taiwan noise because investors don’t think a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is probable Sanjay Devgan an ETF portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments told ETF Stream’s sister publication ETF.com.

“It sounds like it is a lot of sabre rattling” he said.

Given the lack of meaningful reaction it seems the deeper issue worrying semiconductor investors is what a US recession would mean for chipmakers and their suppliers and much of this may already be priced in.

“The most recent downturn was the most pronounced and lengthiest since the financial crisis so we do think equity markets have baked in a good portion of the risks for 2023” Angelo Zino senior equity analyst at CFRA Research told ETF.com.

“We believe that price leads fundamentals and the chip industry is among the most forward-looking in nature” he continued. “Often chip stocks are ready to move up as estimates get cut as they have already been discounted in the shares.”

He added he expects a mild correction in the semiconductor industry because of slowing demand for PC’s and low-end smartphones and increasing capacity.

That downturn will likely bottom in the first half of next year he said and his longer-term outlook is bright as demand over the next decade increases along with growth in the data centre automotive and industrial end-markets.

Share price rebound underway

Meanwhile many semiconductor companies have beaten revenue and earnings expectations recently underpinning a rebound the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index has seen in recent weeks Devgan said.

“My gut tells me the worst is behind us” he said noting that eventually demand for semiconductors will return to the growth trend that the pandemic accelerated as more people work and entertain themselves remotely via the internet.

“Investor fear of the consequences of a recession and rate hikes should already be built into the price of semiconductor ETFs and long term there is a clear trend toward accelerated computing regardless of the near-term macroeconomic effects” Richard Gardner CEO of financial services firm Modulus Global said.

US President Joe Biden has signed the CHIPS and Science Act which will invest $52.7 billion into subsidies for US semiconductor manufacturers.

""Today America is delivering and I honest to God believe that 50 75 100 years from now people who will look back on this week they'll know that we met this moment"" President Biden said at the White House signing ceremony.

He added that it was a ""once-in-a-generation investment in America itself.""

The CHIPS and Science Act will provide $52.7 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for semiconductor companies which they will not be allowed to spend on stocks and dividends.

Of that funding $50bn will be allocated over five years for a 'CHIPS for America Fund' where funding must be used to implement the Commerce Department semiconductor incentive—to develop domestic manufacturing capability as well as R&D and developing a workforce.

Within that $50bn $2bn will go to older legacy chips that are crucial for the automotive industry and military. Up to $6bn will be in the form of loans or loan guarantees. $11bn will go to R&D as directed by the National Semiconductor Technology Center the National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program and other such programs.

Separately $2bn will go to a 'CHIPS for America Defense Fund' where funding will help build tools university prototypes and a workforce with Department of Defense-unique workloads in mind.

$500m will go to working with foreign countries to shore up supply chains support standards and develop secure and trusted telecommunications technologies.

$200m will be spent on growing a skilled semiconductor workforce.

$1.5bn will go to support the Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund with a focus on building open-architecture software-based wireless technologies.

And finally there will be a 25 percent investment tax credit for investments in semiconductor manufacturing that includes incentives for the manufacturing of semiconductors as well as for the manufacturing of specialized tooling equipment.

The bill may soon be joined by the $430 billion Inflation Reduction Act which passed the Senate this Sunday."

Cerner agreed to pay $1.86 million in back pay and interest as part of a deal with federal regulators made public this week.

The company entered early resolution to resolve the allegations voluntarily and agreed to split the money among 1870 applicants who sought employment as medical billing account/patient account specialists system engineers software interns and technical solution analysts between 2015 and 2019 according to a Department of Labor (DOL) news release.

The DOL's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs said it found evidence of discrimination after a routine compliance review of the company. Cerner holds federal contracts with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs according to DOL.

An agency order prohibits federal contractors from discriminating in employment based on race color religion sex sexual orientation gender identity or national origin.

The federal regulator alleged that Cerner systemically discriminated against qualified Black and Asian applicants who applied for positions to work at five facilities in Missouri and Kansas specifically at its Cerner Oaks Campus and Cerner Innovations Campus in Kansas City Missouri and at its Cerner Corp. and Cerner Continuous Campus North Tower in Kansas City Kansas.

Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs Regional Director Carmen Navarro said the agency will work with Cerner to ensure that the issues identified in the compliance evaluation are resolved and that Cerner puts into place ""procedures to ensure compliance with equal employment opportunity laws.""

In addition to the distribution of back pay and interest under the agreement the company will ensure that its hiring procedures are monitored and free from discrimination.

Cerner does not admit liability and denies the allegations.

Federal regulators claim they found statistically significant differences in the hiring rates for Black and Asian applicants compared to similarly qualified white applicants in their review of Cerner's hiring practices according to the compliance agreement between Cerner and DOL.

The alleged bias in hiring practices resulted in a shortfall of Black and Asian hires at Cerner during the four-year period according to DOL.

In its review the federal regulator found statistically significant differences in the hiring rates for racial minority applicants when compared to similarly qualified white applicants for medical billing and patient account specialist positions resulting in a shortfall of 35 Black/African American hires and five Asian hires.

Systems engineers had a shortfall of 20 Black hires and 12 Asian hires and technical solutions analysts had a shortfall of 10 Asian hires the DOL said.

Software giant Oracle bought Cerner in a $28.3 billion deal in June. Oracle has ambitious plans to leverage the EHR vendor to build a national health record database that would pull data from thousands of hospital-centric EHRs Oracle's chairman Larry Ellison said.

The database giant also inherited Cerner's $16 billion beleaguered VA tech project and is working to fix the problem-riddled system.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiuwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaWdpdGFsam91cm5hbC5jb20vcHIvc21hcnQtd2F0ZXItZGlzdHJpYnV0aW9uLW1hcmtldC0yMDIyLWluLWRlcHRoLXJlc2VhcmNoLXdpdGgtZW1lcmdpbmctZ3Jvd3RoLXRyZW5kcy1kcml2aW5nLWZhY3RvcnMtYnVzaW5lc3Mtc3RyYXRlZ2llcy1hbmQtaW5kdXN0cnktc2l6ZS1mb3JlY2FzdC10by0yMDMw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Smart Water Distribution Market 2022: In-Depth Research With Emerging Growth Trends Driving Factors Business ...,“”Radiant InsightsInc”” Radiant Insights Inc has announced the addition of the “Global Abrasive Paper Market Report 2023” report to their offering.

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A group representing heavy-duty truck and engine companies withdrew a lawsuit over emissions standards rollouts that it filed against the California Air Resources Board (CARB) court records showed.

The Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association said on Thursday its lawsuit was intended to ensure California regulators provided manufacturers at least four years of lead time before implementing new heavy-duty engine emission standards.

The group said it wanted the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency which must grant a waiver for California to proceed to confirm a federal lead-time requirement applies to CARB.

In December CARB adopted a series of emissions standards that would apply to new 2024 on-road medium- and heavy-duty engines and vehicles.

CARB noted that heavy-duty vehicles greater than 14000 pounds comprised only 3% of all vehicles on California roads but were responsible for more than 50% of nitrogen oxides and fine particle diesel pollution.

The group which includes Cummins Daimler Truck Caterpillar Paccar and others said its members ""support the nationwide implementation of more stringent tailpipe standards and are committed to transitioning the commercial vehicle market to zero-emission technologies.""

CARB chair Liane Randolph said on Twitter the board was pleased the suit had been dropped and that it was confident that the EPA ""will issue a waiver for these crucial rules and set strong nationwide truck emission standards that build on lessons learned in California.""

EPA did not immediately comment.

In March EPA proposed new rules to cut smog-forming and greenhouse gas emissions from heavy duty vehicles. The new standards would begin in 2027.

The truck group had raised concerns about the proposal and said a successful rule ""must be cost-effective technologically feasible and customer-acceptable ...without hurting blue collar jobs.""

The operational centre is being built on a 11.6 ha plot and has been divided into a number of zones tailored to the needs of Hegelmann’s drivers vehicles and carriers. It is located in Żarska Wieś right next to the German border between the A4 motorway and national road 94.

In addition to a three-storey office building which is to feature a room for the company’s business partners and carriers the site will have a “comfortable” hotel with beds for 750 lorry drivers.

In its original press release regarding the new facility Hegelmann said the rooms in the hotel were to be designed according to the requirements of drivers returning from European routes who need to observe their obligatory rest periods in suitable accommodation outwith the cabin.

“There is no other investment like it in Poland. We are building our own operational centre primarily with a view to ensuring the comfort of our employees. However we have been observing the situation of the transport industry in Poland as a whole. We are considering market needs and the difficulties faced by smaller transport companies in meeting the requirements of the mobility package which is why we have decided to give access to the centre to all drivers and entities also our competitors” said Fedir Yurkevych Hegelmann Poland CEO last summer.

Besides the office and hotel the site will also boast a warehouse with spare parts for trucks and 220 lorry parking spaces.

When the hotel is ready Hegelmann will also be able to adhere to the Mobility Package rules with minimum disruption and additional fuel costs. This is primarily thanks to the operational centre’s location near the border with Germany.

Once the drivers are legally required to return from abroad to their home or employer’s base they can simply nip over the border to the Żarska Wieś site. Then after observing their mandatory rest at the facility the drivers can hit the road again and start transporting goods to or around Western Europe.

By contrast other hauliers with bases in countries like Bulgaria and Romania will have much longer return truck journeys using up more time and extra fuel.

Back in January it also emerged that Hegelmann had also purchased a communist-era hospital building in the Polish city of Częstochowa. It is thought that another ‘mobility package hotel’ could be created there too.

The new findings come from Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 threat intelligence team which is tracking the double extortion ransomware group under the constellation-themed moniker Tropical Scorpius.

Cuba ransomware (aka COLDDRAW) which was first detected in December 2019 reemerged on the threat landscape in November 2021 and has been attributed to attacks against 60 entities in five critical infrastructure sectors amassing at least $43.9 million in ransom payments.

Of the 60 victims listed on its data leak site 40 are located in the U.S. indicating a not as global distribution of targeted organizations as other ransomware gangs.

""Cuba ransomware is distributed through Hancitor malware a loader known for dropping or executing stealers such as Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and other types of ransomware onto victims' networks"" according to a December 2021 alert from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

""Hancitor malware actors use phishing emails Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities compromised credentials or legitimate Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) tools to gain initial access to a victim's network.""

In the intervening months the ransomware operation received substantial upgrades with an aim to ""optimize its execution minimize unintended system behavior and provide technical support to the ransomware victims if they choose to negotiate"" noted Trend Micro in June.

Chief among the changes encompassed terminating more processes before encryption (viz Microsoft Outlook Exchange and MySQL) expanding the file types to be excluded and revision to its ransom note to offer victim support via quTox.

Tropical Scorpius is also believed to share connections with a data extortion marketplace called Industrial Spy as reported by Bleeping Computer in May 2022 with the exfiltrated data following a Cuba ransomware attack posted for sale on the illicit portal instead of its own data leak site.

The latest updates observed by Unit 42 in May 2022 has to do with the defense evasion tactics employed prior to the deployment of the ransomware to fly under the radar and move laterally across the compromised IT environment.

""Tropical Scorpius leveraged a dropper that writes a kernel driver to the file system called ApcHelper.sys"" the company stated. ""This targets and terminates security products. The dropper was not signed however the kernel driver was signed using the certificate found in the LAPSUS$ NVIDIA leak.""

The main task of the kernel driver is to terminate processes associated with security products so as to bypass detection. Also incorporated in the attack chain is a local privilege escalation tool downloaded from a remote server to gain SYSTEM permissions.

This in turn is achieved by triggering an exploit for CVE-2022-24521 (CVSS score: 7.8) a flaw in the Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) that was patched by Microsoft as a zero-day flaw in April 2022.

The privilege escalation step is followed by carrying out system reconnaissance and lateral movement activities through tools like ADFind and Net Scan while also using a ZeroLogon utility that exploits CVE-2020-1472 to gain domain administrator rights.

Furthermore the intrusion paves the way for the deployment of a novel backdoor called ROMCOM RAT which is equipped to start a reverse shell delete arbitrary files upload data to a remote server and harvest a list of running processes.

The remote access trojan per Unit 42 is said to be under active development as the cybersecurity firm discovered a second sample uploaded to the VirusTotal database on June 20 2022.

The improved variant comes with support for a broadened set of 22 commands counting the ability to download bespoke payloads to capture screenshots as well as extract a list of all installed applications to send back to the remote server.

""Tropical Scorpius remains an active threat"" the researchers said. ""The group's activity makes it clear that an approach to tradecraft using a hybrid of more nuanced tools focusing on low-level Windows internals for defense evasion and local privilege escalation can be highly effective during an intrusion.

The findings come as emerging ransomware groups such as Stormous Vice Society Luna SolidBit and BlueSky are continuing to proliferate and evolve in the cybercrime ecosystem at the same using advanced encryption techniques and delivery mechanisms.

SolidBit particularly stands out for its targeting of users of popular video games and social media platforms by masquerading as different applications like League of Legends account checker Social Hacker and Instagram Follower Bot allowing the actors to cast a wide net of potential victims.

""SolidBit ransomware is compiled using .NET and is actually a variant of Yashma ransomware also known as Chaos"" Trend Micro disclosed in a write-up last week.

""It's possible that SolidBit's ransomware actors are currently working with the original developer of Yashma ransomware and likely modified some features from the Chaos builder later rebranding it as SolidBit.""

BlueSky for its part is known to utilize multithreading to encrypt files on the host for faster encryption not to mention adopt anti-analysis techniques to obfuscate its appearance.

The ransomware payload which kicks off with the execution of a PowerShell script retrieved from an attacker-controlled server also disguises itself as a legitimate Windows application (""javaw.exe"").

""Ransomware authors are adopting modern advanced techniques such as encoding and encrypting malicious samples or using multi-staged ransomware delivery and loading to evade security defenses"" Unit 42 noted.

""BlueSky ransomware is capable of encrypting files on victim hosts at rapid speeds with multithreaded computation. In addition the ransomware adopts obfuscation techniques such as API hashing to slow down the reverse engineering process for the analyst.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlbHBuZXRzZWN1cml0eS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8xMS9waG90b3MtYmxhY2staGF0LXVzYS0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photos: Black Hat USA 2022,"Here’s a photo gallery that provides a look inside Black Hat USA 2022.

The Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) project revealed today at Black Hat USA 2022 will help organizations detect investigate and stop cyberattacks faster and more effectively.

The OCSF project was conceived and initiated by AWS and Splunk building upon the ICD Schema work done at Symantec a division of Broadcom. The OCSF includes contributions from 15 additional initial members including Cloudflare CrowdStrike DTEX IBM Security IronNet JupiterOne Okta Palo Alto Networks Rapid7 Salesforce Securonix Sumo Logic Tanium Trend Micro and Zscaler. Starting today all members of the cybersecurity community are invited to utilize and contribute to the OCSF.

Detecting and stopping today’s cyberattacks requires coordination across cybersecurity tools but unfortunately normalizing data from multiple sources requires significant time and resources. The OCSF is an open-source effort aimed at delivering a simplified and vendor-agnostic taxonomy to help all security teams realize better faster data ingestion and analysis without the time-consuming up-front normalization tasks.

The OCSF is an open standard that can be adopted in any environment application or solution provider and fits with existing security standards and processes. As cybersecurity solution providers incorporate OCSF standards into their products security data normalization will become simpler and less burdensome for security teams. OCSF adoption will enable security teams to increase focus on analyzing data identifying threats and defending their organizations from cyberattacks.

Member Quotes:

“Security leaders are wrestling with integration gaps across an expanding set of application service and infrastructure providers and they need clean normalized and prioritized data to detect and respond to threats at scale” said Patrick Coughlin Group Vice President Security Market Splunk. “This is a problem that the industry needed to come together to solve. That’s why Splunk is a proud member of the OCSF community — security is a data problem and we want to help create open standard solutions for all producers and consumers of security data.”

“Symantec and Broadcom Software are proud to have contributed our ICD schema as the foundation for the OCSF project. This is another proof-point of how we support open standards across the security industry"" said Rob Greer GM Symantec Enterprise Division at Broadcom. “The OCSF community will streamline Security Operations for the many thousands of organizations that rely on telemetry from a wide range of sources to power their cybersecurity investigations.”

“Having a holistic view of security-related data across tools is essential for customers to effectively detect investigate and mitigate security issues. Customers tell us that their security teams are spending too much time and energy normalizing data across different tools rather than being able to focus on analyzing and responding to risks” said Mark Ryland Director Office of the CISO AWS. “By increasing interoperability between tools the OCSF aims to greatly accelerate our customers’ ability to understand and respond to cybersecurity concerns. Security is our top priority at AWS and we are excited to work with the OCSF community to drive industry standards that make it easier for customers to operate more securely.”

""Every business deserves a simple straightforward way to analyze and understand the security landscape – and that starts with their data"" said John Graham-Cumming CTO at Cloudflare. ""By participating in the OCSF we hope to help the entire security industry focus on doing the work that matters instead of wasting countless hours and resources on formatting data.""

""At CrowdStrike our mission is to stop breaches and power productivity for organizations"" said Michael Sentonas Chief Technology Officer CrowdStrike. ""We believe strongly in the concept of a shared data schema which enables organizations to understand and digest all data streamline their security operations and lower risk. As a member of the OCSF CrowdStrike is committed to doing the hard work to deliver solutions that organizations need to stay ahead of adversaries.""

""Modern cybersecurity operations is a team sport and products must integrate with each other to provide value beyond what a single product can. Sure it's possible to make that happen with open APIs and mapping data structures but development and processing resources are not infinite"" said Mohan Koo Co-founder and CTO with DTEX Systems. ""The OCSF initiative is about eliminating the inefficiencies and making it possible to achieve frictionless integration through standardized data meaning faster time to detection response and resolution at a lower total cost.""

“Cybersecurity is one of the most pressing challenges of the 21st century and no single organization agency or vendor can solve it alone” said Sridhar Muppidi IBM Fellow Vice President and Chief Technology Officer IBM Security. “IBM Security is a long-standing supporter of open-source and open standards and believes that common data formats like the OCSF will help improve interoperability among many different cybersecurity products allowing the 'power of the crowd' to be used as a force multiplier against increasingly sophisticated adversaries.”

“Collaboration is at the heart of IronNet’s mission so we are proud to join Splunk and AWS as members of the OCSF. By developing an open standard for cybersecurity data we can work together to strengthen cyber defenses as a whole” said General (Ret.) Keith Alexander co-CEO and founder IronNet. “As one of the first members of the OCSF we look forward to growing the framework and sharing relevant insights to enable quicker visibility and a higher level of cyber protection.”

“The OCSF initiative is truly unprecedented” said Erkang Zheng CEO and founder JupiterOne. “Normalizing data prior to ingestion has been one of the biggest pain points for security professionals and the universal framework proposed by the OCSF powered by a common domain knowledge across several security vendors simplifies this time-consuming step ultimately enabling better and stronger security for all.”

“At Okta our vision is to enable everyone to safely use any technology. In a world of broad and deep technology adoption seamless integration and interoperability across applications is critical especially in security tooling” said Christopher Niggel Regional Chief Security Officer for the Americas Okta. “Coalitions like the OCSF help security teams make every user and organization more secure by streamlining access to data from the entire ecosystem of applications in the business enabling faster detection and investigation of threats.”

“We as security vendors need to do right by the security teams who work tirelessly to protect not only their organizations but the greater community against a constantly evolving array of threats” said Sam Adams Vice President of Detection and Response Rapid7. “A step towards that is standardizing the data on which these teams rely. If we can minimize the complexity of using security data from disparate sources we can save security professionals millions of hours every year. Rapid7 has a proud history of supporting the open-source community. We are thrilled to join our peers who share this belief and build a solution that will break down data silos removing a heavy burden that hinders security teams’ efforts to stay ahead of threats.”

“Adding speed and efficiency to cybersecurity is one of the key challenges of organizations fighting ongoing threat inflation” said Augusto Barros Vice President Cybersecurity Evangelist from Securonix. “The OCSF simplifies sharing security data and enables organizations to quickly apply new threat detection analytics and hunt for threats regardless of the source providing the underlying data. This common framework also simplifies the adoption of independent data stores as organizations pursue a new non-siloed approach to store and obtain value from their cybersecurity data.”

“Companies have long recognized the need to share threat data across and between systems and the scope of today’s threat landscape requires standardization so that critical information can be integrated and shared to support the highest levels of efficiency and protection” said Dave Frampton VP and GM of Sumo Logic Security Business Unit Sumo Logic. “Our participation in the OCSF enhances the value of security data for all - to deliver trusted insights to detect investigate and stop cyber threats.”

“As our customers and partners continue to standardize on Tanium’s real-time endpoint data it is important for us to adapt quickly to the everchanging cybersecurity landscape” said Rob Jenks Senior Vice President Corporate Strategy at Tanium. “By adding support in our platform for the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework we are committing to a future where disparate data sources come together to improve the ability to detect investigate and thwart cybersecurity attacks.”

“Data silos and misalignment add unnecessary risk to businesses and headaches for security teams” said Mike Gibson Vice President of Global Customer Success and Threat Research at Trend Micro. “The industry needs an open community to break down the silos and minimize risk by making security more manageable. We are proud to join our peers in building this solution so security teams can focus more on intelligence and spend less time worrying about formats.""

""As a leader in zero trust Zscaler is proud to collaborate with partners on the OCSF universal framework to help customers transform IT and Security"" said Amit Raikar VP of Technology Alliances at Zscaler. ""Zero trust is a team sport. The framework proposed by the OCSF will help break down barriers leading to improved analytics and detections resulting in better enforcement policies.""

“A critical challenge modern SOC teams face today is normalizing disparate data across their multitude of security tools. By defining an open and extensible standard for security event data the OCSF simplifies the data normalization required to detect and defend against modern security threats” said Michelle Abraham Research Director Security and Trust IDC. “Customers who adopt tools implementing the OCSF standard will benefit from less complexity in the building of their data ingestion workflows.""

About OCSF

The OCSF is an open-source effort aimed at delivering a simplified and vendor-agnostic taxonomy to help all security teams realize better faster data ingestion and analysis without the time-consuming up-front normalization tasks. The OCSF project is guided by a steering committee with representatives from AWS and Splunk and jointly managed by a team of maintainers in collaboration with contributors.

The goal is to deliver a simplified and vendor-agnostic taxonomy to help security teams ingest and analyze security data faster.

The companies announced the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) during the Black Hat USA conference on Wednesday in Las Vegas. The participating companies are Broadcom (Symantec) Cloudflare CrowdStrike DTEX IBM Security IronNet JupiterOne Okta Palo Alto Networks Rapid7 Salesforce Securonix Sumo Logic Tanium Trend Micro and Zscaler.

Detecting and stopping today's cyberattacks requires coordination across cybersecurity tools but many of these tools are not interoperable and there are too many different data formats. The OCSF specification will normalize security telemetry across various security products and services said Mark Ryland director of the office of the CISO at AWS in a blog post announcing the project.

""Security teams have to correlate and unify data across multiple products from different vendors in a range of proprietary formats"" Ryland wrote. ""Instead of focusing primarily on detecting and responding to events security teams spend time normalizing this data as a prerequisite to understanding and response.""

OCSF which extends the ICD Schema specifications originally developed by Broadcom’s Symantec division offers a collection of data types an attribute dictionary and taxonomy written in JSON according to an overview of the specification available on GitHub. Contributors can utilize and extend the framework and map the various data ingestion and normalization schemas in a common threat detection language.

""As practitioners one of the most challenging problems in technology is connecting finding and event information across multiple vendor tools operating systems and versions"" says Jamie Scott product manager at Endor Labs. ""A standard data format will reduce cost and accelerate incident triage for our industry as a whole""

An Extensible Framework for Interoperability

As an open source project OCSF seeks to provide an extensible framework for providing interoperable core security schema not tied to a specific provider Splunk distinguished engineer Paul Agbabian wrote in a white paper documenting OCSF. Licensed under the Apache License 2.0 OCSF features an agnostic storage format data collection and extract transform and load (ETL) processes. The schema browser represents categories event classes dictionaries data types profiles and extensions.



""Vendors and other data producers can adopt and extend the schema for their specific domains"" Agbabian explained in a separate blog post. ""Data engineers can map existing schemas to help security teams simplify data ingestion and normalization so that data scientists and analysts can work with a common language for threat detection and investigation.""

""Having a common data format for these events to be shared across tooling will make both consumers and producers lives’ easier. Producers can more easily integrate with other solutions and consumers can aggregate and triage incidents"" Scott says.

The OCSF shares some similar taxonomy with the widely used MITRE ATT&CK Framework according to the white paper though it also noted some stark differences. The most notable is that OCSF is extensible by vendors and customers while MITRE releases all content for ATT&CK.

An Enterprise Strategy Group and Information Systems Security Association (ISSA) survey found that 77% of cybersecurity professionals want to see the industry forge support for open standards. The same survey found that 85% see integration among products as essential.

""Cybersecurity is ready to move on from silos and into an open integrated era of inter-operability and cooperation"" Aghabian noted.

Normalizing Security Telemetry

The project is open to other providers wishing to participate and contribute according to Ryland.

""We see value in contributing our engineering efforts and also projects tools training and guidelines to help standardize security telemetry across the industry"" he wrote. ""Although we as an industry can’t directly control the behavior of threat actors we can improve our collective defenses by making it easier for security teams to do their jobs more efficiently.""

The status of the OCSF and when vendors will begin testing wasn’t immediately apparent. And it remains to be seen to what extent the vendors will ultimately contribute to OCSF and implement it.

""The biggest threat to an early-stage effort like OCSF is the steering committee composition itself. Since the committee is made largely of vendors representative consumer organizations will need a seat at the table to help drive adoption across vendors"" Scott says. ""As the OCSF continues to collaborate with the industry it should ensure that the steering committee has reserved spots for industry practitioners who are willing to make an investment in their mission.""

Erkang Zheng founder and CEO of cyber operations platform provider JupiterOne is pledging to embrace and participate in extending OCSF.

""Over time we will continue to contribute to the OCSF initiative by extending the framework to cover both time-series event data and stateful/structural asset data leveraging JupiterOne’s open-source data model"" Zheng wrote. ""Our hope in participating in this initiative is to inspire more cross-industry collaboration.""

Scott adds: ""Solving a problem like this is a journey that will require learnings across the industry. But the destination makes the journey worth it."""

The Italian version of Paramount+ will feature a library of more than 8000 hours of programming including original series such as video game adaptation Halo Sylvester Stallone crime drama Tulsa King and Taylor Sheridan’s highly anticipated Yellowstone prequel. The platform will also have third-party local originals including new Brit series Sexy Beast French thriller Mask: Marie Antoinette Serial Killer and German drama Simon Beckett’s Chemistry of Death.

From Italy Paramount+’s titles will include Cicero a true-crime drama set in 1970s Italy from Gomorrah producers Cattleya made in collaboration with VIS Paramount+ and RAI Fiction; erotic drama 14 Days a Paramount+ original from writer-director Ivan Cotroneo; and the thriller Corpo Libero a co-production between Indigo Film and Network Movie in co-production with ZDFneo and in collaboration with Rai Fiction and Paramount+ in association with All3Media International Limited.

Paramount is pricing the Italian service at $8.25 (€7.99) a month or $82.50 (€79.99) annually.

After bowing in the UK and Nordic territories Paramount+’s Italian launch will kick off the service’s broader European rollout. Marco Nobili executive vp and international general manager of Paramount+ said the streamer would be launching in Germany and France “in the coming months” and that Paramount+ plans to be in “all major European markets by the end of the year.”

By its own estimation Paramount+ had nearly 64 million subscribers as of the end of March and added 5.2 million new customers over the past quarter a figure partially offset by the loss of 3.9 million subscribers in Russia after the studio suspended its business in the country following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvZ2VuZXJhbC9ob3ctbWFueS1zdWJzY3JpYmVycy1uZXRmbGl4LWhiby1tYXgtZGlzbmV5LXBsdXMtMTIzNDc0NDQ0NS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's How Many Subscribers: Netflix Disney+ Paramount+ and More,"Disney really is the happiest place on Earth this quarter when the company’s core streaming service added more than 14 million subscribers from April to June 2022. Its key competition in the streaming wars Netflix went the other direction during the three-month period.

Netflix followed up its shocking Q1 loss of 200000 paid global subscribers with a decline of 970000 subscribers in the second quarter. Despite losing nearly five times as many global paid subscribers in the second quarter as it did in the first Netflix’s Q2 results w reflected a net positive: Netflix forecast losing twice as many.

Subscriber counts from other major streaming services (courtesy of their parent companies’ quarterly earnings) were also hit-and-miss if less dramatic. NBCUniversal’s Peacock remained flat at 13 million paid subs while its free tier shed 1 million monthly active accounts. On the other end of the spectrum Paramount+ added nearly 5 million paid subscribers.

Where does each subscriber video-on-demand service stand? Find out the results for Netflix Peacock Hulu Disney+ HBO/HBO Max and Discovery+ and Paramount+ below. Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV+ do not provide much transparency into their subscriber/usage statistics — but we’ve got them too.

Here find the version we did of this same story on March 16 — back when subscriber-based streaming was still considered the (tidal) wave of the industry’s future.

Netflix

Still the undisputed king of streaming Netflix ended the second quarter with 220.67 million global paid subscribers. Most significantly it didn’t lose the 2 million subs forecast at the time of its Q1 results. The insane popularity of “Stranger Things 4” surely helped stave off some of those expected losses.

Netflix’s password-sharing crackdown and advertising-supported video-on-demand tier are still in their infancies; both are expected to roll out in 2023. The cheaper ad-supported tier is aiming for “early 2023” Netflix said when reporting second-quarter numbers. The company expects to add 1 million global paid subscribers in the ongoing third quarter.

Peacock

Hey Peacock didn’t lose (paid) subscribers in Q2 — but it didn’t add any either. (And it did lose 1 million monthly active accounts from its unpaid tier.)

To be fair to Peacock Q1 was a disproportionately large one for NBCUniversal; the streaming service had the Super Bowl and Winter Olympics in the same quarter leading to a surge of 4 million paid subs. While that number carried over into Q2 the lack of any second-quarter additions is alarming for a service as young and as relatively small as Peacock.

“Going from zero to 13 million paid subs in a couple of years at Peacock is a great achievement” said Comcast chairman Brian L. Roberts during the company’s Q2 earnings conference call.

Help may be on the horizon: NBC shows will begin to stream next-day on Peacock no longer Hulu this fall.

Hulu

Hulu grew from 45.6 million subscribers to 46.2 million subs during Disney’s fiscal third quarter. As we’ve learned from studying Netflix and Peacock up is up. But this ain’t that up and there is more bad news on the way when NBC pulls its programming from Hulu in favor of Peacock. Of Hulu’s new tally 42 million came from straight-up Hulu SVOD while 4 million users elected to add the Live TV service.

Although its operating income declined in Q3 Hulu is the only of the three Disney Bundle streamers that actually makes money. Losses at Disney+ and ESPN+ grew though executives forecast Disney+ profitability in 2024.

Hulu is 2/3-owned by Disney and 1/3-owned by Comcast — yep the parent company of that pesky Peacock again.

Disney+

Disney+ ended fiscal Q3 with 152.1 million overall streaming subscribers experiencing an impressive addition of 14.4 million subs from April 2 to July 2. Getting more granular Disney+ now has 44.5 million subscribers in the U.S. and Canada. It has even more 49.2 million internationally. Disney+ Hotstar adds 58.4 million subs on top of those.

On Wednesday The Walt Disney Company revealed details of its upcoming AVOD tier; find those including launch date and pricing here. Disney+ AVOD will beat Netflix AVOD to market. By the end of 2024 Disney expects to have 135-165 million Disney+ subscribers and another 80 million Disney+ Hotstar subs.

The third member of the Disney Bundle ESPN+ now has 22.8 million subs. Adding the trio of services up Disney as a company now has a grand total of 221.1 total streaming subscribers. Yes combined the individual services making up the Disney Bundle just surpassed Netflix in overall global subscribers.

HBO Max/Discovery+

HBO HBO Max and Discovery+ had a combined 92.1 million subscribers at the end of Warner Bros. Discovery’s first-ever quarter as a new company which is 1.7 million more than what WarnerMedia and Discovery’s separate streaming tallies added up to at the end of Q1. But that doesn’t mean all of the momentum is positive.

The combination of HBO Max and Discovery+ appears to be progressing slower than expected. On the earnings call executives pegged Summer 2023 as the launch date for the new single service. Whatever that ends up being called (and costing) it will be without a number of Warner Bros. productions.

Last week Warner Bros. Discovery chief David Zaslav decided to totally scrap the (almost) complete “Batgirl” using its $90 million budget as a write down against taxable income. He did the same with fellow straight-to-Max movie “Scoob! Holiday Haunt.” Executives also pulled a number of movies and series from HBO Max in another bottom-line decision although this one at least had some viewership statistics to back it up.

Paramount+

Paramount+ added 4.9 million subscribers in the second quarter (excluding the removal of 1.2 million Russia subs). The service now tops 43 million overall subscribers and continues to make up the lion’s share of Paramount Global’s 63.7 million direct-to-consumer (DTC) subs. (Showtime is another major component of the portfolio but niche platforms like BET+ and Noggin are not.)

The former ViacomCBS has a lofty goal for 2024: 100 million DTC subscribers. Paramount will need a major push to get there but pushing they are. Unfortunately it’s pushing the costs way up.

One could reasonably argue (and win) that Paramount’s best streaming service is its totally free one Pluto TV. The free ad-supported streaming service’s monthly active users increased to nearly 70 million in the second quarter.

Amazon Prime Video

Late last year Amazon revealed that more than 200 million Prime members worldwide streamed its shows and movies in 2021. That was the first (and to date last) time we learned that Amazon had more than 200 million Prime members.

Of course the real value draw for most Prime members is still the e-commerce giant’s free two-day shipping. It’s probably safe to say that if more than 200 million Prime members streamed a show or a movie there are significantly more than 200 million Prime members overall.

Based on Nielsen numbers we know that Prime Video’s “Outer Range” performed quite well in the second quarter of 2022. When it premieres on September 2 Prime series “Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power” will make viewership for the Josh Brolin western seem like an Amazon FreeVee original.

Apple TV+

If you thought we didn’t have much substance on Prime Video you’re going to be pretty disappointed in the dearth of available information about Apple TV+.

Apple TV+ has not necessarily revealed its subscriber number (nor its content spend) but it was forced to give some sort of guidance as part of a union contract dispute reported this past fall.

Apple told the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees that Apple TV+ had fewer than 20 million subscribers in the U.S. and Canada as of July 2021 according to the union. Why the big reveal of a relatively small subscriber base? Under the current IATSE contract with fewer than 20 million subscribers in the area Apple is able to pay discounted rates to production crew members vs. the rates paid by larger streamers like Netflix and Hulu.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3RyZWttb3ZpZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8xMC9zdHJhbmdlLW5ldy13b3JsZHMtaXMtbW9zdC13YXRjaGVkLXBhcmFtb3VudC1zdGFyLXRyZWstb3JpZ2luYWwtY2VvLXNheXMtZnJhbmNoaXNlLWp1c3QtZ2V0dGluZy1zdGFydGVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Strange New Worlds' Is Most-Watched Paramount+ Star Trek Original Debut; CEO Says Franchise “Just Getting Started”,"Star Trek: Strange New Worlds wrapped up its freshman season last month to high praise here at TrekMovie along with a lot of positive buzz from critics and fans. So it should be no surprise to hear that the show is also a big hit for Paramount+.

Strange New Hit

Today Paramount+ sent out an announcement revealing that Star Trek: Strange New Worlds had the strongest debut ever for a Star Trek series setting a new record as the most-watched original series in the franchise over its first 90 days. The series is also off to a strong start internationally ranking as one the top two most-watched original series on Paramount+ in the U.K.

Paramount executives showed their enthusiasm for the show in an official statement released today starting off with the chief of programming for Paramount+ Tanya Giles:

‘Star Trek’ fans all over the world embraced this incredible new ‘Star Trek’ journey. We are thrilled that the ‘Star Trek’ universe continues to be one of the most-watched franchises on the service.

Last week the company announced Paramount+ had grown to 43 million subscribers globally with the most sign-up for any US subscription service during the second quarter of 2022. In a call with investors last week Paramount Global CEO Bob Bakish cited Trek among the drivers for Paramount+ saying:

The power and strength of our franchises existing and new was on full display this quarter thanks to strong performances from Star Trek: Strange New Worlds 1883 of the Yellowstone Universe and our latest South Park special South Park: the Streaming Wars as well as Halo which has become a top driver globally for subscriber acquisition and engagement.

Franchise “Just getting started”

In today’s release president and CEO of CBS George Cheeks offered more praise along with a hint of more to come for the franchise saying:

Over the past six years Alex Kurtzman and his amazing team have brilliantly created and carefully curated a new ‘Star Trek’ universe for Paramount+ with five complementary series – each different in tone style story and in some cases target audience. Each series is a success in its own right and now the franchise’s newest edition Strange New Worlds is earning critical acclaim and delivering notable performance achievements on the service both domestically and internationally. We look forward to the franchise’s continuing journey on Paramount+ here in the U.S. and globally where in the case of Strange New Worlds we’re just getting started.”

The second season of Strange New Worlds has already been filmed and is expected to debut in 2023. There is no official word on a pickup for a third season but with this news the future of the show seems almost certain. And executive producers for the series have previously indicated some planning on season three has already started.

Strange New Worlds is now available to stream exclusively on Paramount+ in the U.S. U.K. Latin America Australia South Korea and the Nordics and airs on Bell Media’s CTV Sci-Fi Channel and streams on Crave in Canada.

Aug 11 2022 9:45 AM ET

Key Takeaways

55% of respondents reported that their companies didn't update their benefits package since switching to a remote work format.

The most desired perk was a home office stipend.

65% percent of employees whose benefits had changed since switching to remote work reported an increased level of job satisfaction.

Sure remote work comes with many inherent benefits—flexibility saving money on the daily commute travel possibilities—but are actual ""benefits"" relevant to the remote worker anymore? Take office snacks and coffee day care or even extra vacation time—do these things matter as much to someone working remotely as they would to someone on-site? Since remote work has become a new norm for many in the corporate world employee benefits may need a tune-up.

After surveying more than 1000 employees across the U.S.—from executive through entry level—the team at Paychex has uncovered new insights into the remote employee benefit conundrum. Employees and employers alike were asked how benefits programs have been adjusted to accommodate their new remote workforce and how those decisions have impacted workers and the company at large. Respondents also shared the benefits they'd most like to see incorporated in the future. If you're curious how benefits for remote workers can look keep reading.

Updating Benefits for Remote Employees

Paychex first asked respondents to divulge how their company had adapted benefits to suit their new remote work format if at all. Employees also shared how satisfied they were with these changes and responses were further categorized by company size.

It immediately became clear that updating benefits packages was associated with several advantages when employees start working remotely. While 88% of employees had been satisfied with their benefits while working on-site the number dropped to 71% when they switched to remote work. The percentage increased to 77% for those participants whose companies had updated benefits to reflect their new needs but dropped to 65% when packages remained unchanged.

The survey also found that among companies that had changed their benefits policy nearly three-quarters asked for their employees' input to do so. This process is part of what's known as the employee feedback loop which can help achieve everything from improving employee tenure to uplifting company culture. As indicated by the survey results it can also help improve benefit packages. Large companies were the least likely to make these much-needed changes.

Benefits Remote Workers Want the Most

So what were the updates most desired by employees after switching to remote work? The next section of the survey asked respondents to share the most common benefit changes experienced as well as the ones they wanted most.

The most common benefit updates for remote workers included flexible working hours and performance bonuses. When asked which additional benefits they most wanted however employees placed a home office stipend (31%) and reimbursement for internet costs (30%) in the top two spots.

Setting up a home office can create a highly valuable ripple effect for both employees and their companies. Practical and aesthetically pleasing home offices can improve everything from an employee's family life to their productivity professional appearance and even the value of their home. This kind of stipend was the single most desirable benefit for Gen Zers and Gen Xers with 22% and 35% requesting one respectively.

Internet reimbursement was another benefit commonly desired by remote workers. On average internet access costs anywhere from $47 to $69 per month and with remote work it typically isn't optional. Over the course of the year this can result in an almost $1000 expense if paid out of the employee's own pocket. Certain states already require employers to reimburse employees for any business-related expenses but it seems to have popularity across the country. A third of millennials wanted this stipend making it this generation's top priority; however only 21% of employers gave it top billing when asked to guess their employees' most wanted benefits.

Baby boomers' top desire was a four-day workweek. With more free time available as a result of increased productivity and not having to commute there's a strong argument for why working five days a week may no longer be a necessary norm. Interestingly this was also the benefit the vast majority of employers felt was their workers' top priority. A four-day work week was proposed in Congress in March of 2022 proving that this idea is gaining some serious traction.

Impact of Updated Benefits on Companies and Employees

The last section of the study looks at how companies with updated benefits have been impacted. Respondents were asked to rate everything from their productivity to morale and company culture.

There were serious perks to updating benefits. Everything from employee loyalty to job satisfaction and company culture saw improvements according to both employees and employers. A large number of employees noted productivity levels improving when employers adjusted their benefits package (73%). It seems there's potential for even more productive working hours.

Employers most often noted an improvement in employee morale (67%) after they updated their benefits packages. Considering how severely tested morale has been during the pandemic years it's encouraging to see a path to improvement. Employees also noticed improvements in diversity levels (58%).

Since going remote 24% of employers said they started hiring employees working in other states. However one-third of employers limited to where their remote employees could live.

A wider applicant pool may also have occurred simply as a result of the company going remote. Instead of selecting employees who can commute to the office within a reasonable time frame companies are now able to cast a wider net. That said one-third of employers still reported limiting where their employees could live.

Evolving Benefits for the Remote World

The evidence strongly supports the positive impact of employers adapting their benefits to suit new remote work cultures. But adapting them without careful thought generally won't cut it. Instead employers should listen to the specific wants of their employees and engage in a positive feedback cycle. Employers who do this will likely enjoy benefits ranging from increased productivity to greater diversity and improved morale.

Methodology and limitations

We surveyed 1060 professionals including 203 employers and 857 employees. 47% worked for large companies 30% worked for midsize companies and 23% worked for small companies. In terms of generational breakdowns 14% were baby boomers 17% were Gen Xers 56% millennials and 26% were Gen Zers. Survey data has certain limitations due to self-reporting.

PayPal is one of the most widely recognized payment methods in the digital sphere. Thousands of freelancers and digital nomads use it to manage their online finances. Most ecommerce sites and check-out portals accept it alongside Visa and Mastercard.

Unfortunately though PayPal does not operate in Pakistan. While you can still possible to create an account if you have a foreign bank account there are easier alternatives for Pakistani freelancers.

When choosing the right digital payment solution though you need to keep your eyes open for fraud and scams. Otherwise you could risk losing money.

To help you we have vetted numerous digital payment methods. In this article we present the winners – the five best PayPal alternatives for Pakistani freelancers.

To start with Payoneer is one of the best PayPal alternatives in Pakistan. The company launched in 2005 and has its headquarters in the US.

Like PayPal it offers a solid set of functionalities for sending and receiving money.

In addition it’s accepted by major global enterprises such as Upwork Fiverr People Per Hour Amazon and Google.

Freelancers can opt to manage payments in US dollars or convert everything into PKR through any VISA ATM. It’s also possible to transfer your money directly to your local bank account.

Sending and receiving payments from other Payoneer customers is free on this platform. However credit card transactions in all currencies are charged at 3% per transaction. When it comes to payments from marketplaces such as Fiverr and Upwork individual fees apply.

Next up SimSim by FINCA Microfinance bank is a viable PayPal alternative for Pakistani freelancers. It launched in 2017 as the first free digital wallet in the country approved by the State Bank of Pakistan.

SimSim offers an app for both iOS and Android devices. Both on the mobile and desktop app it’s easy to manage payments.

Freelancers can set up a SimSim wallet using their CNIC and mobile number. Subsequently you can enjoy this solution’s card-less digital payment system.

However SimSim is probably better-adapted to the needs of rookie freelancers with small and dispersed income streams. Currently it has transaction limits between Rs 500 to Rs 5000.

A definite plus of SimSim is that it doesn’t charge transaction fees internally – only when you send money from the platform to your bank account.

A third fantastic PayPal alternative for Pakistani freelancers is 2CheckOut. The company was acquired by Verifone – a multinational payment corporation based in the US – in September 2020. Still it’s one of the most well-known locally established options that works on a global basis.

Like Payoneer and SimSim it offers fast and straightforward payment management options.

Freelancers can link 2CheckOut with MasterCard American Express and Visa. In addition you can easily set up verified payment paths to make sure that both your and your clients’ money is safe.

2CheckOut has different plans available depending on which level of service you need. The cheapest one – 2Sell – charges 3.5% and a flat rate of $0.35 per sale.

Next on this list is Easypaisa – or Easy Pay. It’s the branchless banking services of Telenor Microfinance bank which in turn is part of the Telenor Group one of the largest global communications platforms.

Easypaisa is designed for Pakistani e-commerce sellers and customers in particular and offers some great features for freelancers as well.

Easypaisa fees are 1% per transaction for mobile accounts 2% for the Easypaisa shop as well as 3% for credit and debit transactions.

Another great PayPal alternative for Pakistani freelancers is SadaPay. This digital payment solution even issues MasterCards to its users.

Furthermore it allows seamless financial transactions and online payments at a global level. Large international corporations such as Netflix Facebook Amazon and AliExpress all accept the SadaPay debit card.

Another advantage of this solution is that it’s fast and easy to set up. All you need to do is install the mobile app and upload a selfie and a picture of your CNIC. Once your account is verified you’ll get full access as well as your card.

One final advantage of SadaPay is also that you can set it up send and receive payments and make withdrawals without paying any fees. The only exception is that foreign exchanges for non-PKR purchases are charged at 1.5% per transaction.

Conclusion: The Best PayPal Alternatives for Pakistani Freelancers

As the list above shows there are several great PayPal alternatives for Pakistani freelancers.

You can harness these digital payment solutions to manage your online finances and successfully handle multiple income streams on a global basis.

Once you’ve compared these options and picked the best to meet your individual needs you’re good to go. You can launch yourself straight into the global freelancing world."

Fortunately I’ve had one exception so far in PepsiCo which recently jumped at the chance to discuss its recently-released Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) summary and talk in general about the company’s progress on regenerative agriculture emissions reductions and other sustainability initiatives.

PepsiCo climate and sustainability commitments at a high-level include reducing absolute emissions by “more than 40%” by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2040.

Speaking to AFN Rob Meyers VP of sustainable agriculture global sustainability at PepsiCo makes it clear that achieving these goals as well as many others along the way is an enormous task — for his company and any other agrifood corporates.

“What [those goals] made us do as a company is think about how we make move and sell our products differently” he says. “We’ve had to take some risks we’ve had to innovate and we’re continuing to have to do that.”

An ‘end-to-end’ overhaul

In 2021 the company announced “pep+” which it calls “a strategic end-to-end transformation” of the entire business with sustainability at the center. At its launch PepsiCo chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta gave the following example last year: “Imagine Lay’s will start with a potato grown sustainably on a regenerative field and then be cooked and delivered from a net zero and net water positive supply chain sold in a bio-compostable bag with the lowest sodium levels in the market”

It sounds great on paper. In reality PepsiCo has 23 different brands — all of which have suppliers agriculture partners and other supply chain participants — to get on-board with and start implementing this “transformation.” Besides the aforementioned Lay’s the PepsiCo roster also includes SodaStream Aquafina Walkers and many other high-profile food and beverage names. After generating more than $79 billion in net revenue in 2021 the stakes are high.

“We do try to work in partnership [with suppliers and farmers] and take a shared value approach” Meyers tells AFN. “We don’t mandate or set out all of these expectations and sit back and wait for them to deliver. It’s very important to collaborate with our suppliers because of the challenges climate poses for all of us.”

One of the key areas where PepsiCo does this is with its farmers.

Regenerating ag for the next generation

In 2021 PepsiCo set a 2030 target goal of adopting regenerative agriculture practices across 7 million acres which is about equal to all of the land PepsiCo uses globally to grow crops and ingredients for its products.

According to its ESG progress report 345000 acres of this farmland worldwide are using regenerative agriculture practices. By the end of 2021 the company had 72 regenerative “demonstration farms” and over 600 farmers transitioned from demonstration stage into broader “landscape” impact programs around regenerative farming. In the US PepsiCo has so far helped farmers plant more than 85000 acres of cover crops.

Meyers says that transitioning farmers to regen ag is as much about business risk mitigation as it is about meeting sustainability targets.

“When you look at some of the core practices of not disturbing the soil diverse crop rotation using inputs really efficiently protecting the diversity on and around a farm these are all really important practices that farmers would find important with an eye towards really being able to hand the farming operation off to the next generation.”

“Farmers have that long view” he adds. “They’re not talking about the next quarter’s financial performance; they’re talking about the next generation.”

Meyers suggests PepsiCo has to address three “somewhat interdependent” areas when working with farmers on the transition to regenerative ag:

1.Financial risk. “Any time you make a change on the farm it’s risky” he says. “A lot of what [farmers] have done on the farm is tried and true.” Methods like cover cropping or no-till may greatly differ from how a farmer has previously worked and therefore represent risk that often has a real cost such as investing in new equipment or seed for cover crops.

“Often when you make a change on the farm the benefits to the farmer may not be realized right away” Meyers says. “There may even be a drop in performance.”

PepsiCo has to factor all of this into its goal of farming 7 million acres regeneratively in a matter of years.

2. Technical assistance and agronomy advice. “We work intentionally with high-quality credible implementation farmers that know this space and have been doing it for a long time” says Meyers.

For example PepsiCo has partnered with the Practical Farmers of Iowa organization to better equip farmers with the information and tools they need for cover cropping and other practices that help build resilience.

3. Collaborative engagement. “We don’t believe we’ll be successful by mandating preferences” says Meyers. “We really focus on the outcomes and we try to engage with farmers in our supply chain to understand and contextualize what that outcome is.”

In real life that means PepsiCo goes out of its way to promote farmers making the switch to regenerative ag practices getting them to talk about what they’ve learned and share that information in the larger community.

Along those lines PepsiCo released its Positive Agriculture Playbook to help farmers set achieve and report regenerative farming goals. It does not dictate specific farming practices or mandate certain things for a farm but is instead a set of suggestions.

Mixed bag for emissions reduction

It’s not a climate check-in without talking about emissions reductions.

As noted above PepsiCo climate commitments include a target goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050. Goals for 2030 include reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions or those controlled by the company by 75% and reducing Scope 3 by 40%. (Both goals were measured versus a 2015 baseline.)

In 2021 PepsiCo reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 25% (from a 2015 baseline) according to the ESG report.

Scope 3 emissions which PepsiCo says account for 93% of its emissions increased by 5% “due to largely unprecedented business growth” that increased packaging use transportation and third-party manufacturing.

Meyers says the biggest challenge around emissions reductions so far has been grappling with the risk that the consumer experience would be negatively impacted by changes made to reduce emissions.

Consider the potato chip-making process Laguarta described above: changing that process from how the potatoes are grown to when and where they’re delivered could impact areas that touch the consumer experience like overall taste availability or price point. That in turn could have a massive influence over brand loyalty and eventually PepsiCo’s overall reach and revenues.

“What we probably hold most dear is that consumer experience with our products” says Meyers. He adds however that PepsiCo and other agrifood corporates will “have to overcome that risk and that fear of doing something different” eventually given the urgency of the climate crisis.

Working together as an industry

“One of the things we need to come together around as an industry is keeping benefits within the food system” says Meyer. “For example if we do carbon credits we [should] try to keep the benefit of those outcomes in the food system.”

Moving forward the industry will also need to think about sustainability data claims accounting and governance. “We need to promote independent credible fair systems around claims and accounting around the protection of data.”

Finally Meyers says that equally important as emissions reductions is simultaneously helping farmers adapt to the impacts of climate change and build resilience to them.

“Both emissions [reduction] and this adaptation component are equally important under the heading of food security” he says. “No one cares more for the farmers having a successful transition than those of us that rely on them.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vZGVjYXR1cmlzaC5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC9waG90b3MtcGVwc2ljby1icmVha3MtZ3JvdW5kLW9uLTI2MC1taWxsaW9uLXR1Y2tlci1mYWNpbGl0eS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,(PHOTOS) PepsiCo breaks ground on $260 million Tucker facility,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://decaturish.com/2022/08/photos-pepsico-breaks-ground-on-260-million-tucker-facility/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vZGVjYXR1cmlzaC5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC9waG90b3MtcGVwc2ljby1icmVha3MtZ3JvdW5kLW9uLTI2MC1taWxsaW9uLXR1Y2tlci1mYWNpbGl0eS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9iaXp3b21lbi9uZXdzL2xhdGVzdC1uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDgvcGVwc2ljby1jaGllZi1vcGVyYXRpb24tb2ZmaWNlci1qb2ludHMtdGFyZ2V0LWJvYXIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former PepsiCo chief operations officer joins Target board,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/bizwomen/news/latest-news/2022/08/pepsico-chief-operation-officer-joints-target-boar.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9iaXp3b21lbi9uZXdzL2xhdGVzdC1uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDgvcGVwc2ljby1jaGllZi1vcGVyYXRpb24tb2ZmaWNlci1qb2ludHMtdGFyZ2V0LWJvYXIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBsYXN0aWNzbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9wZXBzaWNvLWN1dHMtYm90dGxlLWRlc2lnbi1jb3N0cy10aW1lLTNkLXByaW50ZWQtbW9sZC1pbnNlcnRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PepsiCo cuts bottle design costs time with 3D printed mold inserts,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.plasticsnews.com/news/pepsico-cuts-bottle-design-costs-time-3d-printed-mold-inserts on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBsYXN0aWNzbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9wZXBzaWNvLWN1dHMtYm90dGxlLWRlc2lnbi1jb3N0cy10aW1lLTNkLXByaW50ZWQtbW9sZC1pbnNlcnRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RvdWdsYXN5dS8yMDIyLzA4LzExL3dlcmUtc2NhbGluZy1yYXBpZGx5LWNlbHNpdXMtZW5lcmd5LWRyaW5rcy1jZW8tdG8tc3RyZWFtbGluZS1sb2dpc3RpY3MtYWZ0ZXItcmVjZWl2aW5nLTU1MC1taWxsaW9uLWludmVzdG1lbnQtZnJvbS1wZXBzaWNvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'We're Scaling Rapidly': Celsius Energy Drink's CEO To Streamline Logistics After Receiving $550 Million Investment ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/douglasyu/2022/08/11/were-scaling-rapidly-celsius-energy-drinks-ceo-to-streamline-logistics-after-receiving-550-million-investment-from-pepsico/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RvdWdsYXN5dS8yMDIyLzA4LzExL3dlcmUtc2NhbGluZy1yYXBpZGx5LWNlbHNpdXMtZW5lcmd5LWRyaW5rcy1jZW8tdG8tc3RyZWFtbGluZS1sb2dpc3RpY3MtYWZ0ZXItcmVjZWl2aW5nLTU1MC1taWxsaW9uLWludmVzdG1lbnQtZnJvbS1wZXBzaWNvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Before the COVID-19 pandemic the end-to-end timeline for bringing vaccine and drug candidates from discovery to market could take 10 to 15 years or more. However this paradigm changed when the SARS-CoV-2 virus was identified as an imminent worldwide threat. Pfizer’s pandemic response — via external partnership reduction of bureaucracy and a purpose-driven culture — exemplifies this shift and provides real-world lessons on how to help avoid a regression to pre-pandemic ways. Credit: Jean Terman

External factors that facilitated this included global sharing of the genome sequence; existing mRNA-related technologies for vaccine development; and earlier coronavirus work (including research by the National Institutes of Health on stabilizing spike proteins) that informed vaccine design and research. Meanwhile Pfizer’s own facilitating factors included deep investments over the past decade in research and development infrastructure; extensive experience in infectious disease research; talented agile teams of scientists engineers physicians and staff; and therapeutic proof-of-concept for protease inhibitors designed against SARS-CoV-1. Despite these advantages many challenges loomed. The mRNA approach was unproven and early vaccines and monoclonal antibody treatments could not account for antigenic change. In the spirit of the adage about desperate times Pfizer took a creative approach to maximize the facilitating factors while mitigating the challenges that remained.

The rapid pace with which Pfizer and its collaborator BioNTech developed tested manufactured and marketed their COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 (Comirnaty) demonstrated that this process can be markedly shortened by streamlining decision-making and running several steps in parallel. This approach which we termed ‘lightspeed’ was similarly used to develop the oral COVID-19 treatment nirmatrelvir and ritonavir tablets (Paxlovid).

For Comirnaty Pfizer’s collaboration with BioNTech leveraged the strength of both companies to rapidly develop the vaccine: mRNA experience for BioNTech and vaccine research and development for Pfizer. For Paxlovid Pfizer used in-house experience with protease inhibitors as well as AI- and structure-based small-molecule design to invent a main protease (Mpro) inhibitor that limited the risk of causing resistance. For both modalities academic partnerships were instrumental in generating data with collaborating coronavirus experts with biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facilities.

The clinical and product-development paradigms were similar for Comirnaty and Paxlovid with resource investment and allocation that far exceeded the norm and little evidence that either modality would work. Both had expedited clinical programs with more clinical sites than would normally be deployed. For Comirnaty a seamless phase I–III clinical study was conducted with several candidates tested simultaneously during phase I. This eliminated the usual transition periods between phases and was achieved in consultation with regulatory agencies. For Paxlovid an adaptive design led to dose selection and to the inclusion of ritonavir to maximize exposure of nirmatrelvir.

While existing infrastructure supported the lightspeed approach changes in Pfizer’s governance structure promoted a clear mission and unified set of goals. The result was a purpose-driven culture that matched the urgency of the approach. Vaccine and Hospital (anti-infective) area heads representing different functions met whenever needed to assess opportunities and drive rapid decision-making within and across lines. These meetings were followed by almost daily check-ins with Pfizer chief scientific officer Mikael Dolsten and weekly meetings with Pfizer chief executive officer Albert Bourla and key members of his leadership team to review activities and obtain endorsements in real-time.

Meeting preparations were minimal in favor of clear constant communication across the organization. At the same time Pfizer worked externally with regulators such as the US Food and Drug Administration to ensure that the data from any successful programs were sufficient to support making the product rapidly available to patients.

Development and supply timelines were driven by manufacturing. With a limited supply chain and accelerated development process the supply of final products initially lagged. Despite these challenges Pfizer achieved in mere months what usually takes years: scaling-up processes from gram-quantities to the tons required to help supply the globe.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1c3F1LmVkdS9saXZlL25ld3MvMTQ4MS1wZml6ZXItaW50ZXJuc2hpcC1jb21iaW5lcy1sb3ZlLW9mLXNjaWVuY2UtcGVvcGxl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer Internship Combines Love of Science People,"August 10 2022

By Haley Dittbrenner ’25

Katherine Fackler ’23This summer marketing major Katherine Fackler ’23 participated in a remote internship with Pfizer. This comes after previous experience with JGS Insurance Utz Brands and Biotronics3D. Fackler interned with Pfizer’s marketing and sales department combining her love of science and people.

“I wanted to work with Pfizer because they’re a cutting-edge company and I would be able to gain great experiences in the pharmaceutical world learning how to market their different products and in my case U.S. vaccines” Fackler of Hummelstown Pennsylvania said.

Fackler who is minoring in professional sales cited her business courses study-abroad experience and professional development class with Allie Grill director of the Career Development Center as exceptionally helpful. Grill’s classes taught Fackler how to handle questions in an interview what questions to ask a company and how to maintain relationships with past employers via LinkedIn.

“I was able to discuss the experiences I had abroad and show what skills I’d be able to bring to Pfizer for the summer” Fackler said. “I also believe that Susquehanna University’s emphasis on teamwork teaches you how to communicate with a group ensure everyone is doing their part and handle any problems that arise in a respectful way.”

Several of Fackler’s projects involved analyzing keywords and how sales representatives use them then working with the sales and marketing departments to develop new content for consumers. She has also created digital display ads for a brand of vaccines that will be implemented once it goes out to market. Additional responsibilities include conducting kickoff meetings scheduling meetings with both brand marketers and sales representatives and creating marketing plans.

The obstacles Fackler had to overcome were brought on by the remote nature of the internship. “One of the biggest challenges is keeping people on top of responding to your messages and emails” she said. “You can’t be afraid to keep reminding people about setting up a meeting time or sending a file you need for a task you’re given.”

Fackler has enjoyed numerous successes at Pfizer including the opportunity to work with multiple brand teams through her projects. Her favorite assignments included working with sales representatives and marketers updating keywords for search engines and conducting website enhancements and reorganization.

Fackler said her internship provided her with real-world experience pertaining to how marketers work with sales representatives. The fast-paced environment gave her the chance to practice adapting to changes quickly whether that be in the workplace market or industry. She also gained new insights into outreach for diverse groups of consumers and healthcare providers.

After graduation Fackler hopes to work in the pharmaceutical industry in marketing or sales.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rc2RrLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvYnVzaW5lc3Mtam91cm5hbC9wZml6ZXItZXhwYW5zaW9uLWItY2hlc3RlcmZpZWxkLWNhbXB1cy1vZmZpY2UtbGFib3JhdG9yeS1zcGFjZS1taXNzb3VyaS82My05NWVkZDZhZi01N2E2LTQxMDEtOWMxZC0zNjcxYTA4MmVmYzPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer expands Chesterfield campus with new spaces included | ksdk.com,"The addition will include three stories of office and laboratory space.

CHESTERFIELD Mo. — Construction is underway on an expansion to Pfizer's $236 million Chesterfield research and development facility.

The Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) campus at 875 Chesterfield Parkway West has been the starting point for millions of Covid-19 vaccine doses in a facility that began operating in 2020. The Chesterfield campus at the intersection with Olive Boulevard is the primary site of raw materials production for the vaccine.

The New York-based company will add a three-story addition of about 30000 square feet to the 31-acre facility which opened in 2019 and replaced two previous Pfizer facilities on Bayer’s campus and the Missouri Research Park in St. Charles County.

With the new space added the affected building will have 291000 square feet according to plans filed with the city of Chesterfield. That brings the building’s footprint to just under what's allowed by the site's zoning: 135000 square feet per level.

In all Pfizer will have 398431 square feet of space across its buildings at the Chesterfield property once the expansion finishes construction according to a city report.

Part of the addition will have three stories of office and laboratory space with another portion consisting of a two-story elevated bridge that will create a covered pedestrian plaza connecting the courtyard to the rest of the site.

Results from this model highlight the importance of both individual factors such as age sex and vaccination status and location-specific factors that reflect the current pandemic landscape such as transmission intensity case incidence and CFR from COVID-19 and COVID-19- and Pfizer vaccine-associated myocarditis. Our model could be used to help inform discussions and decision-making for population health managers individuals and clinicians. In this way the model may aid in policy development public health management increased public awareness and improved shared decision-making in medical consultations.

For Australians ≥12 years we compared the risk of developing Pfizer vaccine-associated myocarditis with the benefit of protection against developing and dying from symptomatic COVID-19 over 2 months under different transmission scenarios if 5% were unvaccinated 5% had a first dose 3 weeks ago 60% had two doses (20% each with the last dose administered 0 to < 2 2 to < 4 and 4 to < 6 months ago) and 30% had three doses with the last dose administered < 4 months ago. Overall an Australian is 471 to 5847 times more likely to develop COVID-19-related myocarditis if infected with SARS-CoV-2 than vaccine-associated myocarditis and 1430 to 384684 times more likely to die from it depending on age and sex (Fig. 2a). Under a transmission scenario where the chance of infection was 5%–10% over 2 months an Australian who is not already infected with SARS-CoV-2 is 5–88 times more likely to develop myocarditis from COVID-19 than the Pfizer vaccine and 13–2466 times more likely to die from it (Fig. 2c d). Under a lower transmission scenario where the chance of infection was 1% over 2 months all age-sex subgroups except for 20–29-year-old males are more likely to develop myocarditis from COVID-19 than the Pfizer vaccine and all age-sex subgroups are more likely to die from it (Fig. 2b) an important finding for informing individual decision-making on Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination. Crucial also for informing public health decision-making modelling showed that under any transmission level younger age groups benefited the most from protection against symptomatic COVID-19 while older age groups benefited the most from protection against fatal COVID-19 (Fig. 3) both critical markers of vaccine effectiveness373839. Younger age groups were at higher risk of developing vaccine-associated myocarditis than older groups and males were at greater risk than females. We note that myocarditis was more common after COVID-19 compared to the background rates especially in younger men. In comparison vaccine-associated myocarditis also has a predilection for younger males but at a much lower prevalence than cases associated with symptomatic COVID-19. Importantly in the main vaccination is justified in all age groups because myocarditis is generally mild in the young404142 and there is unequivocal evidence for reduced mortality in older individuals across all levels of community transmission.

While the above risk-benefit analyses were conducted assuming the Australian vaccine coverage at the time of writing outcomes under other coverage rates can be assessed by the model to further inform public health decision-making. We compared the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths expected if the chance of infection was 10% over 2 months under a scenario where 5% are unvaccinated 5% had a first dose 3 weeks ago 60% had two doses (20% each with the last dose administered 0 to < 2 2 to < 4 and 4 to < 6 months ago) and 30% had three doses with the last dose administered < 4 months ago to those expected under a second scenario where 0% are unvaccinated 5% had a first dose 15% had two doses (5% each with the last dose administered 0 to < 2 2 to < 4 and 4 to < 6 months ago) and 80% had three doses with the last dose administered < 4 months ago (Fig. 4). Younger age groups benefited from the steepest decline in expected case rates with at least 23000 fewer cases per million in 20–29 year olds. In contrast older age groups benefited from the greatest decrease in expected deaths from COVID-19 with 337 fewer deaths per million expected in those aged ≥70 years.

The evidence on the risks versus benefits of COVID-19 vaccination was derived from an range of sources each associated with some level of uncertainty. The use of probabilistic modelling techniques such as BNs can contribute somewhat to communicating this uncertainty by framing the outcomes in terms of probabilities. However the nature of the evolving pandemic landscape means that the most update-to-date evidence will rarely be free of uncertainty. While we have not attempted here to quantify the uncertainty levels of the data used to parameterise individual components of the BN all assumptions surrounding their use have been fully explained and justified. Sensitivity analysis was also used to examine the impact of some of the data uncertainties on the model estimates.

Sensitivity analysis showed model estimates to be robust against minor changes in the number of Pfizer vaccine-associated myocarditis cases (Table 2) but highly affected by changes in vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection and death (Table 3). At a public health level this holds important implications for COVID-19 burden if new variants such as omicron for which vaccine effectiveness is decreased continue to emerge or if vaccine effectiveness proves to wane over time. While vaccine effectiveness would have to drop to a very low threshold for the associated myocarditis risk to outweigh the benefit of protection against symptomatic infection and death from COVID-19 in any age-sex-subgroup this result highlights the importance of updating the model as new evidence becomes available or new variants emerge.

Model estimates must be contextualised within the scope of the BN model which does not currently consider comorbidities or personal behaviour that may influence an individual’s risks of acquiring COVID-19 their response to the infection or their individual risk of myocarditis. Furthermore limitations to the availability of Australian data introduces uncertainty in the model inputs so results may change as more data become available. For example the incidence of vaccine-associated myocarditis in Australia reported by TGA defines myocarditis based on varying degrees of certainty (e.g. confirmed diagnosis by clinical evidence tests and imaging versus ECG versus possible diagnosis based on symptoms and a doctor’s report that myocarditis is the most likely diagnosis in the absence of medical tests and investigations)31. The rate also includes cases of myocarditis that occurred after vaccination but may not be vaccine-related (possibly due to background risk instead)31. This uncertainty in the diagnosis of myocarditis may also introduce reporting bias e.g. self-reporting of adverse events may be influenced by exposure to relevant news in the media resulting in temporary fluctuation in the reported incidence. In another example at the time of writing no Australian data were available on the incidence of Pfizer vaccine-associated myocarditis after the third dose and international data were deemed inappropriate as a substitute (see Table 1 assumptions) necessitating the use of rates for the second dose as a worst-case scenario. In a third example when calculating the delta variant-specific CFR from COVID-19 ideally CFR for the unvaccinated population would be used and the 2-to-3 week lag between diagnosis and death accounted for. This information was not available in Australia so the assumptions were made that the time-window of a few months for the delta wave was long enough to minimise the effect of time lag from infection to death and the great majority of deaths during the delta wave was in unvaccinated people. Other limitations arise from the model development process where the use of expert elicitation may be perceived to introduce bias in the evidence viewed. This was minimised through broad literature searches and frequent meetings with external experts such as cardiologists about the quality of the data sources used in the model assumptions.

Despite these limitations the use of an evidence-based BN to model the risks and benefits of COVID-19 vaccination has many advantages. BNs allow for interactive scenario analysis so the model was well-suited for use in programming CoRiCal a free online tool aimed at better informing the public and helping clinicians to best advise patients on the risks and benefits of COVID-19 vaccination19. Another benefit of BNs is the ease of updating allowing for future model updates to incorporate other outcomes such as long COVID different patient groups such as those < 12 years and those with comorbidities other vaccines such as Moderna or different vaccine adverse events such as anaphylaxis. Finally BNs are advantageous due to their integration of new data and different data sources in informing different aspects of the model. While this model has been designed for the Australian context conditional probability tables (CPTs) can easily be re-populated wherever possible using data from another country.

In summary we developed a BN to compare the risks and benefits of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination in the Australian population that incorporated emerging evidence of waning vaccine effectiveness over time and the recent recommendation of third doses in order to assist clinicians with providing guidance about the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. In a community rather than individual context the final model can also be used to calculate population-level estimates to help inform policy development and public health management. Although designed to compare risks of developing and dying from COVID-19 COVID-19- and Pfizer vaccine-associated myocarditis for the delta variant the model can be updated to consider the omicron or other variants other inputs such as patient comorbidities and other outcomes such as long COVID.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9wZml6ZXItaW5jLXN0b2NrLXJpc2VzLXdlZG5lc2RheS1zdGlsbC11bmRlcnBlcmZvcm1zLW1hcmtldC0wMTY2MDE2NjA3NC0zNDI4YjdhNDNkZGLSAX5odHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vYW1wL2RhdGEtbmV3cy9wZml6ZXItaW5jLXN0b2NrLXJpc2VzLXdlZG5lc2RheS1zdGlsbC11bmRlcnBlcmZvcm1zLW1hcmtldC0wMTY2MDE2NjA3NC0zNDI4YjdhNDNkZGI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer Inc. stock rises Wednesday still underperforms market,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/pfizer-inc-stock-rises-wednesday-still-underperforms-market-01660166074-3428b7a43ddb on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9wZml6ZXItaW5jLXN0b2NrLXJpc2VzLXdlZG5lc2RheS1zdGlsbC11bmRlcnBlcmZvcm1zLW1hcmtldC0wMTY2MDE2NjA3NC0zNDI4YjdhNDNkZGLSAX5odHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vYW1wL2RhdGEtbmV3cy9wZml6ZXItaW5jLXN0b2NrLXJpc2VzLXdlZG5lc2RheS1zdGlsbC11bmRlcnBlcmZvcm1zLW1hcmtldC0wMTY2MDE2NjA3NC0zNDI4YjdhNDNkZGI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL3V0YWgvYXJ0aWNsZS9taXJvLWxpdHRsZS10cmFuc2Zlci1wb3J0YWwtY29tbWl0bWVudC11dGFoLWJheWxvci1wZy10cmFuc2Zlci0tMjMxMzU1NDU3L9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL3V0YWgvYXJ0aWNsZS9taXJvLWxpdHRsZS10cmFuc2Zlci1wb3J0YWwtY29tbWl0bWVudC11dGFoLWJheWxvci1wZy10cmFuc2Zlci0tMjMxMzU1NDU3L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BREAKING: Four-star transfer PG Miro Little has committed to Utah,"On Tuesday Craig Smith and the Runnin' Utes picked up a very valuable transfer portal addition after former Baylor guard and four-star transfer Miro Little announced his commitment to the program. This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

PM,Philip Morris International,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3RoZWNvbnZlcnNhdGlvbi5jb20vY2lnYXJldHRlLWFkdmVydGlzaW5nLWFnZ3Jlc3NpdmVseS10YXJnZXRzLWtpZHMtaW4tbG93LWFuZC1taWRkbGUtaW5jb21lLWNvdW50cmllcy1hLW5ldy1zdHVkeS1maW5kcy0xODY2MjjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cigarette advertising aggressively targets kids in low- and middle-income countries a new study finds,"The Research Brief is a short take about interesting academic work.

The big idea

The world’s largest multinational tobacco companies are advertising cigarettes to kids near playgrounds and schools in 42 majority low- and middle-income countries. That’s the key finding of our recently published paper.

Through our on-the-ground data collection at 19500 points of sale we identified tobacco industry advertising and promotions demonstrating four common tactics. These include displaying cigarettes near snacks sweets and sugary drinks; placing cigarette advertisements near children’s eye level; marketing flavored cigarettes through ads and/or product displays; and selling single cigarette sticks.

We collected data on how cigarettes are marketed and sold within 250 meters or about 820 feet of one or more schools and/or playgrounds in more than 100 cities around the globe. The locations included most capital cities and spanned Africa Asia Central America Europe North America and South America.

Our findings correspond with similar research conducted in high-income countries. Taken together our research and that of others suggests that in the absence of strong restrictions and enforcement the tobacco industry is employing similar marketing strategies all around the world with what we believe is the specific intention to attract and addict children and youth.

Why it matters

Many jurisdictions throughout the world have implemented laws prohibiting advertising of tobacco products on radio television and billboards. As a result comparably less restricted point-of-sale opportunities have become a critical component of tobacco company marketing strategies. This includes the “Big Four” global giants: Philip Morris International British American Tobacco Japan Tobacco International and Imperial Tobacco.

Previous research has established that in the face of advertising restrictions the tobacco industry will refocus its marketing efforts – and dollars – on unregulated channels such as the point of sale. Tobacco companies themselves have acknowledged the effectiveness of the point-of-sale channel developing effective marketing strategies and resources geared toward maximizing potential sales. Tobacco companies provide incentives to retailers to market their products in this manner.

Our findings summarized below show that the tobacco industry uses point-of-sale advertising widely and consistently targets youth.

• In 90% of the countries we studied cigarettes were displayed near junk food or sugary drinks including some self-serve displays within children’s reach.

• We found ads or displays promoting flavored cigarettes which are known to appeal to minors in 76% of the countries we studied.

• Stores selling tobacco in 78% of countries sold single cigarettes making the product more affordable.

• Points of sale in all 42 majority low- and middle-income countries displayed cigarette advertising at kids’ eye level featuring “Big Four” tobacco products or ads.

Research is clear that kids who are frequently exposed to tobacco advertising and promotion at points of sale have higher odds of trying smoking and are more likely to be susceptible to smoking in the future compared to those who are less frequently exposed. Smoking kills 8 million people worldwide each year and is the leading cause of preventable death.

Experts have also established links between point-of-sale advertising and smoking-related behaviors and beliefs like misperceptions that smoking is less harmful than it really is and a lower likelihood of quitting smoking.

What’s next

Our work focused on what consumers see and did not differentiate between products that were on sale legally versus those sold illicitly.

The World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control an international treaty ratified by 182 parties and covering more than 90% of the world’s population recommends a variety of evidence-based strategies to counteract these marketing tactics. These include comprehensive bans on tobacco advertisement promotion and sponsorship plain tobacco packaging large graphic health warnings on tobacco packs bans on single-stick cigarette sales and regulation of flavors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8va2VueWFud2FsbHN0cmVldC5jb20vNi1ibHVlLWNoaXAtc3RvY2stZm9yLXNhZmUtaW5jb21lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,6 Blue Chip Stock With High 4%+ Yields For Safe Income,"This is a guest contribution by ValueWalk for SureDividend

Building the perfect portfolio takes time and insight into the broader macroeconomics of the stock market. During times of economic uncertainty and increased volatility building and managing a portfolio with increased returns and a safe bet against turbulent economic conditions is a challenge.

The market is full of different investors some who enjoy high-growth value stocks while others tend to play it safe investing in household names that offer them better security. The plethora of seasoned investors tends to seek out stocks that offer them some sort of hedge or protection when market conditions are near correction territory.

At the same time external factors such as company performance and the broader economic conditions of the consumer market also play a big role in what investors look to purchase.

A good example of how external factors can influence investors’ sentiment is the recent interest rate hike of 0.75 percentage points the biggest increase since 1994. The decision by the central bank to hike its benchmark interest rate is to help soften the rampant inflation American consumers are currently facing.

Aggressive hikes such as these tend to lead investors into changing their market sentiment and course of investment.

Stocks that can perform amid economic difficulties such as a looming recession or bear market tend to have better investor sentiment. So far 2022 has been a tumultuous year for the stock market and it’s looking to become even more uncertain as experts suggest that America is heading into a recession.

With the market outlook sinking to new lows and investors looking to move their cash from the stock market rather than parking it in safer less volatile places it’s perhaps time that smaller less seasoned investors look to do the same.

With this in mind here’s a look at some of the top blue-chip stocks with a high 4%+ yields for safe income.

Philip Morris International Inc. (PM)

As one of the leading manufacturers and distributors of cigarettes cigars fine-rolling tobacco snuff and smoking accessories worldwide Philip Morris is perhaps a safe choice for investors looking for a company with a 4%+ yield.

For starters PM is priced well averaging between $85.64 (52-week low) and $112.48 (52-week high). At the start of 2022 PM offered a 4.88% dividend yield and in their latest earnings call PM yielded $1.25 with a P/E ratio of 16.95. The latest figures indicate that PM has a dividend yield of 4.71% a bit lower than earlier in the year but still a safe bet in the current market conditions.

Besides the United States Philip Morris holds substantial influence over the tobacco industry especially in Europe and African markets.

Verizon Communications (VZ)

As one of the three largest telecommunications companies in the United States among T-Mobile and AT&T Verizon is perhaps the only of the picks that have held stable performance amid market turbulence.

Besides that VZ currently has an annual dividend yield of 5.22% other market leaders such as AT&T have cut their dividends as it undergoes corporate restructuring and T-Mobile Inc. does not even offer dividends.

Verizon currently holds 40% of the American postpaid phone market and has in recent years increased its fiber occupation in major U.S. metros. Some investors feel that Verizon has tangled itself by offering consumers a mixed amount of services and products which can be difficult to manage and retain revenue from. On the other hand the company has a steady growth strategy that has delivered better profitability than its rivals.

Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM)

Major oil refiners and gasoline producers have seen profits hit new records in recent months amid the ongoing geopolitical tension between Ukraine and Russia. With gas prices at record-shattering highs even higher than the 2008 financial crisis a safe bet is reliable energy companies that offer increased dividend yields.

Current XOM shares offered a 4.33% dividend yield and stocks are priced relatively low considering the return investors are getting. As one of the world’s largest publicly traded international oil and gas companies XOM has seen prices fluctuate between $52.10 and $105.57 per share over the last 52 weeks.

Exxon proves to provide a solid investment low-lying prices and high dividend yields for a company that’s globally recognized. The company is a household name when it comes to energy gas and oil.

Iron Mountain Incorporated (IRM)

Founded back in 1951 Iron Mountain Incorporated is an American information management services company headquartered in Boston Massachusetts.

Iron Mountain Inc. is perhaps one of the few publicly traded companies that have managed to outperform Wall Street estimates. In its Q1 2022 earnings call IRM surpassed predicted EPS by 1.54% and revenue by 1.04%. Iron Mountain stocks currently offer a 5.35% dividend yield as of June 2022.

The company operates in more than 58 countries with offices in Africa Asia Europe and Latin America.

International Business Machines Corporation (IBM)

The multinational tech giant came under direct line of fire in recent weeks as the broader market saw a wave of investors pulling out of tech stocks sparking a major tech sell-off.

While the market has in time recovered IBM has managed to gain some of its earlier losses. Even during the height of the major tech sell-off IBM saw share prices tumble by 6.68%. Shares started June on a high note but have since remained relatively consistent in the $140.00 and $135.00 per share zone.

Currently IBM offers a 4.89% dividend yield as of June 2022. In its Q4 2021 earnings call IBM managed to outperform market estimates by $730.50 million with post earnings per share surpassing $3.35 on $16.70 billion revenue.

National Health Investors Inc. (NHI)

NHI is best known as a real estate investment trust that specializes in sale-leaseback and joint venture financing for need-driven senior housing and medical investments. National Health Investors has a solid balance sheet and is quite reasonably priced.

At the start of 2022 NHI had a dividend yield of 6.34% the highest among blue-chip offerings. Their dividend yield has come down slightly edging closer to 5.90% in recent weeks.

Stock prices have also increased by 9.91% over the last six-month period with a 52-week average of $50.22 (low) and $69.23 (high). NHI is perhaps a safer bet for starter investors who are looking to increase their portfolio yield without having to run major risks.

Why Should You Include Blue Chip Stocks In Your Portfolio?

For most investors who are looking to build a balanced portfolio that has increased value with less risk blue-chip stocks offer a safe foundation in volatile market conditions.

When market sentiment is swaying in various directions blue-chip offerings can be considered a lower risk than per se high valued tech companies that tend to grow slower during a market downturn.

What Are The Characteristics Of Blue-Chip Stocks

As already mentioned blue-chip stocks can offer investors a lower-risk investment opportunity when the market is volatile.

Some of the characteristics of blue-chip stocks include well-established companies marketplace leaders a strong balance sheet reputable market reputation leaders in their field of expertise and oftentimes pay dividends to their shareholders.

While the last characteristic is true some blue-chip companies may offer dividend payouts to shareholders based on their performance. While some may have a dividend yield above 4% there are those larger publicly traded companies that can offer lower dividends anything closer to 0.9% 1% or 2%.

Are Blue-Chip Stocks A Safe Bet In Current Market Conditions?

The answer may offer a mixed bag of results but blue-chip stocks can be both risky and a safe option for any type of investor.

For novice investors there should be a clear distinction between what is considered a “safe” or “secure” investment opportunity. In the world of investments nothing is for sure and trading on the public market does come with its inherent risks regardless of expertise and market knowledge.

Consider choosing blue-chip companies that have a solid track record that offers increased dividends and that are constantly looking to develop and innovate their marketplace.

The Bottom Line

Market conditions may have inched closer towards correction territory and while many estimate that the current bear market is a result of overstimulating the economy during the early months of the pandemic and a rapid increase in consumer spending – nothing is a given when it comes to trading.

Novice investors should consider their current standing in the market and where they would enjoy the most beneficial growth in the long term.

Investing in blue-chip companies does come with some form of risk but when market sentiment is lower these are perhaps the safer options for long-term growth.

RENO Nev. Aug. 10 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- One of the country's most advanced renewable fuel plants will officially launch operations at Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center in Storey County Nevada. New Rise Renewables Reno will produce 44 million gallons per year of renewable diesel made from triglyceride oils from sources such as corn.

The renewable diesel produced by New Rise Renewables Reno is completely interchangeable with diesel derived from petroleum and can efficiently power diesel engines such as semi-trucks and large-scale emergency generators. The fuel burns with clean emissions. Phillips 66 is under contract to supply all of the feedstock for New Rise Renewables Reno and will purchase 100% of the renewable diesel product for use and sale nearby in California according to New Rise Renewables Reno which is owned by Nevada-based RESC Renewables Holdings.

Representatives from Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak Nevada Congressman Mark Amodei and Nevada Senators Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen inaugurated the facility at an on-site event today along with Storey County officials.

""New Rise Renewables and its proven technology represent the future. Renewable diesel is emerging as the renewable fuel of choice as the world begins to move away from fossil fuels. Notably unlike ethanol or biodiesel renewable diesel does not and is not mixed with petroleum products in order to perform"" said Jeremy Gilpin executive vice president of Reno-based Greater Commercial Lending (GCL) which facilitated $112.6 million in government-guaranteed credit for the development of New Rise Renewables Reno.

""GCL is proud to have helped assemble the loan package that made New Rise Renewables Reno possible. It is one of only a few significant renewable diesel plants in the U.S. though there are certainly more on their way. A notable fact about the facility is that once it is in full operation it will require minimal external energy. It will use its own internal energy recovery system to power the production of renewable diesel"" Gilpin added.

Eighty percent of the GCL-arranged financing for New Rise Renewables Reno is guaranteed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) via its 9003 Biorefinery Renewable Chemical and Biodiesel Production Manufacturing Assistance Program. The financing structure includes participation by GCL parent Greater Nevada Credit Union other credit unions insurance companies and secondary market groups.

Said Randy Soule leader of the New Rise Renewables Reno facility ""The USDA-guaranteed financing was what enabled the project. The favorable flexible terms of the government guaranteed loan package were essential. With flexible financing the financials may not have worked out and our team wouldn't have been able to maintain complete oversight and control.""

""Congratulations to New Rise Renewables Reno and thanks to Greater Nevada Credit Union for supporting quality industries in Nevada"" said Nevada Congressman Mark Amodei.

Nevada U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto added ""Northern Nevada's clean energy companies are helping us combat the climate crisis while fueling our economy and creating good-paying jobs for Nevadans. Businesses like New Rise Renewables are proof of what's possible with government-guaranteed loans and when we all come together at a federal state and local level to foster innovation and growth. I'm proud to see this facility come online and I'll keep working to support our clean-energy economy throughout Nevada.""

""Nevada is a leader in clean energy and I'm proud to continue fighting to bring more good-paying clean energy jobs to our state"" said Nevada U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen. ""Renewable diesel plants like New Rise Renewables will help create jobs while helping our country move towards a cleaner energy future. I'm thankful to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for helping clean energy companies like this one in our state.""

The New Rise Renewables Reno plant which was developed by retrofitting an existing fuel plant is projected to save nearly 880 million pounds of carbon emissions the equivalent of removing 88000 vehicles from the roads. The primary plant has been completed and a pre-treatment and energy recovery system designed to increase output and operational efficiency will be fully operational in early 2023. The facility uses the most advanced renewable diesel technology in the U.S.

Renewable diesel is made by causing chemical reactions through the addition of hydrogen to the natural fats and oils. New Rise has deployed proven state-of-the-art efficient and cost-effective technology methods which involves hydrogenating the triglycerides. The process uses hydrogen pressure catalyst and heat in an efficient manner allowing reactions to be uniform and controlled – increasing yield lowering operating costs and allowing for feedstock flexibility.

The fuel plant is located in the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center the largest industrial park in the world. Other occupants include Tesla Walmart Google FedEx Switch and Panasonic.

More than 250 electricians scaffolders and pipe fitters all took part in the walkout at Phillips 66 South Killingholme from around 6am on Wednesday August 10. They took to the gates outside of the refinery where their supervisors and management watching on.

The firm recently reported earnings of $3.2 billion over the second quarter of 2022 leaving its contractors furious at their current pay. The crowd was adamant that their salaries were not reflective of the current cost of living crisis and so they are demanding a 15 per cent pay rise.

Earlier this year the workers were given a 2.5 per cent pay increase but many said that this was simply not enough. One striker who wanted to remain anonymous told Grimsby Live: ""We're earning less money than we were three years ago seeing as tax expenses have gone up.""

Another person in the crowd said: ""Ten years ago this was an alright job but it's behind the times now. The wages just aren't up to date."" Another picketer added: ""We might as well have taken a pay cut without even realising.""

Furious staff even hung up a banner on the A180 Westbound pressuring the company to give into their demands. The banner read: ""PP pay the rate"".

Fuel is just one cost which is crippling some of the workers. As per their policy the company contributes to these expenses however workers said it was not enough. One contractor told us he was spending around £40 a week in travel to get to the refinery from Grimsby and said Phillips 66 only gives him £14 towards this.

Some other contractors travel from Barnsley Middlesbrough and even Leeds to get to the plant. They say they are even more out of pocket.

Fellow contractors from the neighboring Lindsey Oil refinery came out in support of the strikers at around 9.05am. ""The cost of living is supposed to go up 11.6 per cent and we're only going to get a 2.6 per cent pay increase"" said one advocate. ""If it carries on like this there will be people not being able to live. People can't afford to live now.

The government needs to know this is going on.""

Grimsby Live reached out to refinery manager Darren Cunningham after he was spotted watching from the company office block. He refused to comment on the matter.

At around 9.45am some strikers began to go back to work whereas some especially those that were drinking headed home. More strikes are being planned for every other Wednesday until the matter is resolved.

A Philips 66 spokesman said: ""Phillips 66 Limited can confirm that today Wednesday August 10 some workers employed by contractor companies engaged by Phillips 66 Limited at the Humber Refinery have taken strike action. We understand from the relevant contractor companies that this is unofficial industrial action regarding pay.

""The Humber Refinery has in place with its contractor companies an agreed package of contractor rates which follow nationally agreed rates with extra enhancements and bonuses in place for specific planned refinery maintenance events. We will continue to work closely with our contract companies. Refinery safety and operations remain unaffected.""

Or so it would seem.

Videos by American Songwriter

The Los Angeles-hailing rock band The Red Hot Chili Peppers have seen the other side of California the darker and blatantly superficial side of the state. And not only did the band see the flip side of this community but they wrote a song about it. In 1999 the Chili Peppers—whose current lineup consists of members Anthony Kiedis Flea Chad Smith and John Frusciante—released the ever-popular “Californication.”

Read more about the meaning of “Californication” below and a warning it gets pretty dark.

The meaning of “Californication.”

“Californication” is a song about the underbelly of American society. There’s deceit plasticity and desperation under the gilded face of the American Dream. The Red Hot Chili Peppers saw that California represented these extremes—both the elaborate gilded nature of it all and the darkness underneath. In essence it’s a song about the rot that lies just underneath the surface.

Putting pen to paper The RHCP presents this message through a string of clever allusions and metaphors about the Dream of Californication.

Break It Down.

The song was written by band members Kiedis Smith Flea and Frusciante and deserves a quick breakdown of verse to get the full picture of the song. The lyricism in this song after all is poetic in the sense that it shows the listener what is going on rather than just telling them what is happening around them.

Jumping right in the opening verse touches on the wide geographical reach that California holds. Both China and Sweden are mentioned in the first two lyrics:

Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind’s elation

And little girls from Sweden dream of silver-screen quotation.

While the first verse was taken from a personal encounter Kiedis had with a woman on the street it also makes a subtle jab at the increasing amount of consumerism in America. The second verse the reference to Swedish women attempting to make it big in Hollywood makes a comment on the disappointment that many people face once arriving in California. And if you want these kind of dreams it’s Californication.

Shortly after these lines the second verse makes the point that Hollywood sells the idea of California. Hollywood capitalizes on the people believing that California is the pinnacle of western civilization after all it’s the edge of the world and all of Western civilization.

Then arriving at the bridge of the song the RHCP points out the incredible amounts of plastic surgery in California. People are never who they seem even in appearance.

The third verse then comments on the glorification of sexual relationships without the realities of those very relationships. A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information the band sings. In his autobiography Kiedis explained this line in detail: “I had met a young mother at a meeting. She was living in a YWCA with her baby girl trying to get sober but failing miserably. The beauty and sadness and tragedy and glory all wrapped into one of this mother/daughter relationship was evoked by the vibe of that music [‘Californication’].”

Following that the fourth verse dives into some specific figures and phenomena in pop culture. Star Trek Kurt Cobain and Star Wars are all alluded to in this verse—see if you can find each one. Finally the fifth and final verse points to the lasting presence of Californication. Earthquakes and tidal waves couldn’t save the world from Californication.

Not the sunny California you imagined eh?

The success of “Californication.”

“Californication” was released over 20 years ago but its lyrics still ring true. Its relaxed sing-song sound is impressively infectious and the song quickly became one of the RHCP’s most popular tunes. The band continues to play it live and has played “Californication” at almost every show since its release. The album of the same name was also hugely successful for the L.A. rockers.

There must be something to this Dream of Californication.

PITTSBURGH Aug. 11 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- PNC Bank announced today that it will no longer charge any consumer deposit account customers non-sufficient fund (NSF) fees. This marks the company's latest effort to enhance the financial well-being of its customers and extends the benefit it created with Virtual Wallet deposit accounts as part of the launch of Low Cash Mode® in April 2021.

""As a Main Street bank PNC is focused on building a platform that empowers the financial well-being of its customers"" said Alex Overstrom head of Retail Banking for PNC. ""Over the last several years we've made significant enhancements to our overdraft solutions all of which are designed to help our customers and give them better control of their financial future. Eliminating NSF fees on consumer deposit accounts is just another way we are helping our customers strengthen their financial wellness.""

An NSF fee sometimes referred to as a Returned Item Fee occurs when a payment transaction is returned due to insufficient funds. An overdraft fee is charged when the bank completes the transaction by covering the dollar amount of the shortage resulting in a negative account balance. With this change if an item is returned by the bank a PNC consumer deposit account customer will no longer incur an NSF fee.

This strategic move comes roughly a year after PNC was among the first financial institutions to take a major step in addressing overdraft fees with the launch of Low Cash Mode a cornerstone feature of its Virtual Wallet® Spend account that provides consumers with real options for avoiding overdrafts while maintaining overdraft availability for those who need to make payments during temporary cash shortfalls. With the launch of Low Cash Mode PNC already had eliminated NSF fees for customers with Virtual Wallet Spend. Now PNC's additional personal checking account types will receive this benefit.

PNC Bank National Association is a member of The PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (NYSE: PNC). PNC is one of the largest diversified financial services institutions in the United States organized around its customers and communities for strong relationships and local delivery of retail and business banking including a full range of lending products; specialized services for corporations and government entities including corporate banking real estate finance and asset-based lending; wealth management and asset management.

The acquisition is expected to be completed before the end of 2022 subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. The terms of the deal between the private companies were not disclosed. Solenis and Clearon will continue to operate as independent companies until the deal closes.

“Once closed this transaction will align the strong legacy and complementary capabilities of two remarkable companies both of whom are committed to safe reliable and sustainable operations for the betterment of their customers and the communities in which they operate. This combination will allow our customers to be met with a diverse portfolio of solutions while providing tremendous growth opportunities for Clearon’s most precious asset our employees” Kitchen said in a statement.

The acquisition of Clearon comes shortly after Solenis acquired Turkish product supply manufacturer Neu Kimya Anonim Şirketi and earlier SCL GmbH a German producer of dimethylaminoethyl acrylate or DMA3 a primary raw material in the production of a group of water-soluble polymers with a wide range of applications.

Solenis which was acquired by California-based private equity investment firm Platinum Equity last fall for $5.25 billion emerged from former Hercules and Ashland water treatment divisions dating back to 1907 launching its current iteration in 2015.

“This acquisition will help Solenis fulfill a strategic growth initiative following our recent ownership change to Platinum Equity driving value through our branded Pool Solutions sanitization product line while providing an enhanced customer experience through expanded offerings and cost-effective pool solutions” John Panichella CEO of Solenis said in a statement. “We continue to work closely with the Platinum Equity team to identify opportunities to add value for our customers and drive growth for the Solenis team.”

Solenis currently serves two primary segments: consumer solutions for food packaging graphic paper and tissue and towel markets; and industrial solutions for core water treatment and wastewater markets. As a result of its Platinum Equity acquisition it also merged operations with former firm Sigura which specialized in the production and sale of water care solutions and value-added services for residential and commercial pool and spa applications as well as industrial markets.

Solenis now has 47 manufacturing facilities worldwide and employs over 6000 in 120 countries across five continents. It opened a new headquarters at Avenue North off U.S. Route 202 in 2020 and employs about 200 people in Delaware there and a research and development lab leased on the Ashland campus off Hercules Road.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIyMDgxMDAwNTI4OS9lbi9Wb2x0dXMtUGFydG5lcnMtd2l0aC1DaGVzYXBlYWtlLUVuZXJneS1Db3Jwb3JhdGlvbi10by1EZWxpdmVyLTEwLU1XLW9mLUZhc3QtUmVzcG9uc2UtR3JpZC1TZXJ2aWNlcy10by1Pa2xhaG9tYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Voltus Partners with Chesapeake Energy Corporation to Deliver 10 MW of Fast-Response Grid Services to Oklahoma,"SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Voltus Inc.

A small group of students stood nearby signs in hand protesting Lockheed’s presence and informing others about a recent massacre.



Weeks earlier 40 children had been killed when a Saudi-led coalition air strike dropped a 500-pound bomb on a school bus in northern Yemen. A CNN investigation found that Lockheed — the world’s largest weapons manufacturer — had sold the precision-guided munition to Saudi Arabia a year prior in a $110 billion arms deal brokered under former President Donald Trump.

Back in Storrs Conn. Lockheed which has a longstanding partnership with UConn appeared on campus to recruit with TED-style talks flight simulations technology demos and on-the-spot interviews. A few lucky students took a helicopter flight around campus.



UConn is among at least a dozen universities that participate in Lockheed Martin Day part of a sweeping national effort to establish defense industry recruitment pipelines in college STEM (science technology engineering and mathematics) programs. Dozens of campuses nationwide now have corporate partnerships with Lockheed and other weapons manufacturers. Lockheed is the country’s single largest government contractor producing Black Hawks F-35 fighter jets Javelin anti-tank systems and the Hellfire missiles found on Predator drones. With more than 114000 employees the company depends on a pool of highly skilled and highly specialized workers complete with the ability to obtain proper security clearances when needed. In its most recent annual report Lockheed tells investors ​“We increasingly compete with commercial technology companies outside of the aerospace and defense industry for qualified technical cyber and scientific positions as the number of qualified domestic engineers is decreasing and the number of cyber professionals is not keeping up with demand.” Lockheed has hired more than 21000 new employees since 2020 to replace retiring workers and keep up with turnover. Student pipelines are integral to the company’s talent acquisition strategy. As tuition costs and student debt have skyrocketed Lockheed has enticed students with scholarships well paid internships and a student loan repayment program. When the pandemic made in-person recruitment more difficult Lockheed expanded its virtual outreach — after one 2020 virtual hiring event the company reported a 300% increase in offers and a 400% increase in job acceptances among the STEM scholarship program participants over the previous year. And in a self-described effort to diversify its workforce and build an inclusive culture Lockheed has also put new focus on financial support and recruitment at historically Black colleges and universities. Lockheed’s recruitment efforts are intertwined with various types of ​“research partnerships.” Universities receive six- and seven-figure grants from Lockheed and other defense contractors — or even more massive sums from the Department of Defense — to work on basic and applied research up to and including designs prototypes and testing of weapons technology. A student might work on Lockheed-sponsored research as part of their course load then intern over the summer at Lockheed be officially recruited by Lockheed upon graduation and start working there immediately with defense clearances already in place — sometimes continuing the same work. In 2020 Lockheed reported that more than 60% of graduating interns became full-time employees.

LOCKHEED’S CAMPUS RECRUITING TARGETS (DESIGN BY DAVID FOSTER/RACHEL K. DOOLEY)

Lockheed is not alone among corporations or military contractors in its aggressive university outreach but the expansive presence of private defense companies on campuses raises questions about the extent to which corporations — particularly those profiting from war — should influence student career trajectories. In April student and community protesters at Tufts University shut down a General Dynamics recruiting event then protested outside a Raytheon presentation later that month chanting ​“We see through your smoke and mirrors. You can’t have our engineers.” Illah Nourbakhsh an ethics professor at Carnegie Mellon University with a background in robotics presents the question this way: ​“If you have a palette of possible futures for students and you take some possible future and you make it so shiny and exciting and amazing by pouring money on the marketing process of it that it overcomes any possible marketing done by alternatives that are more socially minded — do the kids have agency? Is it a fair balanced field? “Of course not.” Lockheed did not respond by deadline to requests for comment on this article. For more than a year In These Times investigated the presence of Lockheed and other arms manufacturers on campuses combing through company and university annual reports IRS filings LinkedIn profiles budgets legislative records and academic policies as well as interviewing students and professors. Most students requested pseudonyms indicated with asterisks* so as not to adversely impact their career prospects. Several spoke positively of Lockheed. “It’s probably what most engineers especially in mechanical and aerospace who want to go into defense prospects aspire to” says Sam* who graduated with a bachelor’s in aerospace engineering in December 2021. ​“They’re one of the biggest defense contractors in this country so you have the opportunity to work on very state-of-the-art technology.” Other students believe putting their skills to military use is unethical. Alan* a December 2021 graduate in electrical engineering at the University of West Florida who is currently job-hunting while living with his parents says he’s not looking at defense contractors and is instead holding out for a position that allows him to leave the Earth better than he found it. ​“When it comes to engineering we do have a responsibility” he says. ​“Every tool can be a weapon. … I don’t really feel like I need to be putting my gifts to make more bombs.” Located near the world’s largest Air Force base in the Florida panhandle the University of West Florida regularly hosts recruiters from the defense industry including Lockheed. Alan says companies like Lockheed set up tables in student buildings to recruit in the hallways. “I just walked past those tables” he says ​“but sometimes they’ll call you over. It’s kind of like going to the mall and people want you to try their soap. It’s kind of annoying but I get that they always need new people.” Our investigation found this unfettered recruiting access to be part of a deeper and growing enmeshment between universities and the defense industry. Decades of state disinvestment in public higher education have converged with a growing emphasis on sponsored research and in an era of ballooning student debt the billions in annual defense spending prop up university budgets and subsidize student educations. The result is that many college STEM programs around the country have become pipelines for weapons contractors.

Since 9/11 the U.S. has ﻿spent $8 trillion on war. ﻿In 2020 for the first time federal funding to Lockheed Martin surpassed that of the U.S. Department of Education the federal agency tasked with dispensing scholarships and Pell grants.

BIG NAME ON CAMPUS The Georgia Institute of Technology’s campus in Midtown Atlanta features 400 acres of manicured lawns sports facilities and collegiate Gothic-style red brick buildings interspersed with an eclectic mix of facilities that chronicle the university’s evolution over 13 decades. Romanesque neoclassical and Renaissance revival facades clash with the concrete Brutalist design of the architecture school and the jutting steel-and-glass exteriors and green roof of the LEED-certified Clough Commons. Portions of the 1996 Olympic Village have been converted into student housing. Academic buildings are connected by glass skywalks. The barracks erected during World War II have been taken down and the athletic fields no longer double as gunnery practice. Military training once required for freshmen and sophomores has been discontinued. But if you’re an engineering student at Georgia Tech Lockheed is omnipresent. You may run into Lockheed’s recruiters at career fairs or in the lobbies of the Student Success Center the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering or the College of Computing. They may be hosting a seminar on space exploration in the Clary Theatre. They may be sponsoring challenges and awarding prizes to students during ​“Engineering Week” or hosting workshops where teams use Minecraft and Lego bricks to explore the future of digital work. You’ll see Lockheed’s logo displayed on the career center’s website and job portal alongside such other corporations as ExxonMobil Capital One and The Home Depot — just one of Lockheed’s privileges as a member of the university’s Corporate Partnership Program.



As an Executive Partner Lockheed is provided with interview rooms consultations with the school’s employer relations team and access to an online résumé book featuring current students and recent graduates. Georgia Tech also assists students with a Lockheed cover letter template. And of course there’s Lockheed Martin Day. “They show off some flight simulations but also you might give a recruiter your résumé and they might give you an interview” says Sam who was set to do an internship at Georgia Tech’s satellite laboratory on the grounds of Lockheed’s Marietta Ga. aircraft plant before Covid shifted the internship remote. ​“I definitely aspire to get into Lockheed someday.” Sam’s been set on the defense field since high school inspired in part by watching documentaries about Area 51 the classified Air Force facility in Nevada at the center of UFO conspiracy theories which was used to test Lockheed’s U-2 reconnaissance aircraft during the Cold War. The opportunity to work on secret cutting-edge technology attracts him to the company. Other students aren’t as enthused about Lockheed’s campus presence.



Cameron Davis who graduated from Georgia Tech with a bachelor’s in computer engineering in 2021 says ​“A lot of people that I talk to aren’t 100% comfortable working on defense contracts working on things that are basically going to kill people.” But he adds the lucrative pay of defense contractors ​“drives a lot of your moral disagreements with defense away.”



In 2019 and 2021 Lockheed was the university’s largest alumni employer and the company has been one of Georgia Tech’s most frequent job interviewers since at least 2002.



​“Even in my field — which isn’t even as defense-adjacent as aerospace engineering or mechanical engineering — companies like Raytheon will have dedicated programs to recruit people” says Davis. ​“I’ve been in line with other companies at a career fair and defense contractors literally walk up to me in line and be like ​‘Hey do you want to talk about helicopters or something?’”

“The corporate presence at Georgia Tech is a little bit overwhelming at times” says Adam* a graduate student in machine learning. ​“The college very aggressively pushes getting a career which is great for a lot of people but sometimes I feel like there’s not enough emphasis placed on taking into consideration the moral and ethical side of it.” As alternatives to employment with defense contractors STEM students could be working on technologies to decarbonize the power grid revolutionize transportation or reimagine the built environment. Upon graduation they could take jobs at the Federal Aviation Administration EPA or NASA. “I talk a lot about opportunity costs” says Nourbakhsh who teaches a freshman ethics class at Carnegie Mellon. ​“It doesn’t matter whether somebody else will do that work or not. What matters is what you want to be proud of doing in your life. If you choose to do thing A and work on this military project then you’re explicitly choosing not to do things B C D and E.”

Lockheed Martin’s career website features an enthusiastic campaign about what people can do “only here” at Lockheed. For many students that list increasingly includes paying off student loans.

THE MILITARY’S STUDENT RESEARCHERS



Clifford Conner recalls his freshman year at Georgia Tech in 1959 when the school was still segregated. He studied experimental psychology. When graduation approached his professors — who also worked in the Lockheed Corporation’s Marietta office just north of Atlanta — said they could help him get a job at Lockheed. Conner accepted. His work on the wing design of the C-5 Galaxy then the largest military cargo plane in the world took him to England where he began reading a lot about the war in Vietnam. ​“I wasn’t under the spell of the American press” Conner says. After a few years with Lockheed he quit and joined the antiwar movement. It took him another year to find a job at about a third of the salary he was making at Lockheed. Conner went on to become a historian of science and a professor at the CUNY School of Professional Studies. His most recent book The Tragedy of American Science: From Truman to Trump (2020) explores how the STEM fields have moved away from improving the human condition to advancing corporate and defense interests. He writes about the Bayh-Dole Act which removed public-licensing restrictions in 1980 and ​“opened the floodgates to corporate investors seeking monopoly ownership of innovative technology.” The law allowed universities and nonprofits to file patents on projects funded with federal money from weapons to pharmaceuticals. The rationale was to encourage commercial collaboration and underscore the idea that federally funded inventions should be used to support a free-market system. “After the Bayh-Dole Act the lines between corporate university and government research were all blurred” Conner tells In These Times. Then in the 1990s President Bill Clinton’s administration hatched the idea of giving large federal research grants to universities with a partner company built in explains Peter Asaro a philosopher of science technology and media and an associate professor at the New School. “The idea is you get basic research or proof of concepts of technological innovations to come out of the university system and then you transition that to a defense contractor who is going to develop it to the point where it becomes something that the military can actually use” Asaro says. ​“Starting around 2000 [the government] really targeted specific institutions with strong engineering programs with partnership models. A big part of that initiative in the early 2000s was to establish research collaborations between universities and defense contractors.” Lockheed’s relationship with Georgia Tech has only strengthened since Conner’s time as a student. Georgia Tech’s applied research division known as the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) now has four laboratories directly on Lockheed’s aeronautics campus in Marietta after borrowing an estimated $62 million in 2017 to purchase the facilities from Lockheed and renovate them. The sprawling new facility dubbed the Cobb County Research Facility South (CCRF-South) is located on an old Air Force plant adjacent to the Dobbins Air Reserve Base which shares a runway with Lockheed. Next door Lockheed assembles C-130 military transport planes and the center wing of the F-35 fighter jet. As a financially independent lab affiliated with Georgia Tech GTRI relies on sponsored funding for its research. In 2021 GTRI received more than $780 million in sponsorships which exceeds the university’s combined revenue from tuition and state appropriations. Ninety percent of GTRI’s funding comes from the Pentagon. CCRF-South features more than 200000 square feet of offices laboratories an auditorium a communal dining area and bright co-working spaces. An additional 140000 square feet of high-bay industrial warehouse space is dedicated to individual assembly labs equipped with cranes capable of lifting up to 30 tons. Inside the laboratories researchers and students work on everything from missiles sensors and radar to target identification drone testing and weapons systems simulations. Details of weapons research can take years to obtain through public records requests if at all because they are deemed proprietary or classified. Students at Georgia Tech were reluctant to speak with the press about the details of their defense work. An unspecified number are required to sign non-disclosure agreements and obtain security clearances. But publicly available CVs résumés and job listings for student researchers at GTRI explicitly detail work on weapons technology.



Additionally GTRI’s annual reports show that the labs have worked on simulators for Lockheed’s Black Hawk helicopters and flight data analysis for the F-35 fighter jet. It also has an office at the Army’s Aviation & Missile Center and an ​“indefinite delivery indefinite quantity” research contract with the army potentially worth $2.35 billion over 10 years. GTRI provides technical support and prototyping to the Distributed Common Ground System the Pentagon’s 24/7 global near-real-time intelligence and combat network that analyzes data from Global Hawk Predator and Reaper drones.



Since 2012 GTRI has more than doubled its revenue and CCRF-South is set up to accommodate its expansion.



​“There are graduate students who are dependent on those [defense grants]” says Asaro. ​“That’s the pipeline because basically you’re paying for the degree you’re paying the room and board their salaries while they’re getting the degree and then they’ve become an expert in the system that is going to transition to this private contractor who’s standing there with a job waiting for this graduate student to finish this degree.”



Georgia Tech did not respond by deadline to requests for comment on this article.



Nourbakhsh at Carnegie Mellon does not take military funding for research at his Community Robotics Education and Technology Empowerment Lab. Today he says it’s not unusual for professors to refuse defense funding in their labs.



He believes seeing professors ​“do the right thing” can have a great influence in the STEM field. But he also says universities have become fundamentally reliant on defense funding.



​“If 50 other professors in my department did it [refused military funding] there just wouldn’t be enough money” says Nourbakhsh. ​“The research direction here gets set by the industrial military-industrial and government complexes rather than by individual professors.” Unlike Europe the United States does not provide universities with general funding to support basic research or ​“research for the sake of research.” A 2019 analysis by the American Association for the Advancement of Science for example notes ​“on average one-third of R&D in OECD countries” is funded by ​“government block grants used at the discretion of higher education institutions” — but the United States does not have the same mechanism. U.S. appropriations to public higher education meanwhile have declined significantly in the past two decades while the research environment has seen universities performing an ever-larger share of the nation’s technology research. The Defense Department has been the third-largest source of federal research and development funding to universities for decades (after the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Science Foundation).



But universities also seek out private-sector money to fund research directly and the defense sector has been a willing donor.



In recent years Lockheed has partnered with a network of more than 100 universities to advance hypersonics technology — weapons traveling so fast they’re undetectable by radar — and signed master research agreements for multi-year collaborations with Purdue Texas A&M and Notre Dame in 2021. While delivering technological innovations to defense companies these partnerships also double as employment pipelines. The University of Colorado Boulder has collaborated on space systems with Lockheed for nearly two decades. In a statement on the university’s website one Lockheed executive (and school alum) writes ​“Lockheed Martin employs about 56000 engineers and technicians 35% of which could retire in the next few years. We must keep up a ​‘talent pipeline’ to fill this pending gap: currently our major source of talent is CU-Boulder.”

SADDLED WITH DEBT

Nearly half of the nation’s discretionary budget goes toward military spending; of that money one-third to one-half goes to private contractors according to a 2021 analysis by military researcher William Hartung for Brown University’s Costs of War Project. Today 46 million Americans hold student debt totaling $1.7 trillion which is the projected lifetime cost to U.S. taxpayers of Lockheed’s F-35 fighter jet program — the most expensive weapon system ever built. One featured employee on Lockheed’s website Luis says he’s worked as a circuit design engineer at Lockheed for five years. Before starting at Lockheed he racked up $187000 in student debt. “As a first-generation immigrant college student my parents did not have the wisdom to provide me with the proper guidance” he says on the Lockheed website referring to the college application process. After earning a master’s in electrical engineering Luis got a job with Lockheed where he took advantage of the company’s tuition reimbursement program to earn a second master’s in computer engineering. ​“This was accomplished while paying off both my wife’s and my student loan debt totaling over $337K” Luis says. ​“After five years we are now DEBT FREE!”

Lockheed is among a growing number of companies that offer student loan assistance to its employees. The company’s Invest In Me program offers incoming graduates a $150 monthly cash bonus for five years and a student loan refinancing program. Every year Lockheed awards $10000 scholarships to 200 students that may be renewed up to three times for a potential $40000. Lockheed also lists 61 universities participating in its STEM scholarship program projected to invest a minimum of $30 million over five years as part of a larger $460 million education and innovation initiative using gains from Trump’s 2017 corporate tax cuts.



In a 2015 survey by American Student Assistance 53% of respondents said student debt was either a ​“deciding factor” or had a ​“considerable impact” on their career choice. “Pushing people into higher education has been our labor policy” explains Astra Taylor a writer filmmaker and co-founder of the Debt Collective a debtors’ union with roots in Occupy Wall Street. ​“You’re indebting yourself for the privilege of being hired and it gives companies this economic power because then they can say ​‘We can help relieve some of the economic pain that you’ve incurred to make yourself appealing to us.’”



Raytheon Northrop Grumman and Boeing all provide some form of student aid such as scholarships and tuition reimbursement.

DIVERSIFYING WEAPONS MAKING

The private defense sector targets much of its financial support toward historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and students from minority groups as part of stated efforts toward workforce diversity and promoting STEM jobs among a demographic that is critically underrepresented in STEM fields. Lockheed’s website and annual report note that minority groups are the ​“fastest-growing segment in the labor market” and that recruitment through ​“internships early talent identification outlying educational programs co-ops apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeships” is integral to building diverse employee pipelines. This trend stirs up old controversies around military recruiting in communities of color. The Army has long targeted minority-majority high schools and HBCUs with its Reserve Officers’ Training Corps programs and scholarships to the extent that critics refer to it as a school-to-soldier pipeline. Without enlisting and the ensuing funding many students wouldn’t receive a higher education. According to a 2016 report from the Brookings Institution Black students hold an average of $7400 more in student debt than their white counterparts upon graduating — a gap that widens to nearly $25000 four years later. The Army leverages students’ predicaments to meet its recruiting goals. Regardless ​“the racial implications” of U.S. military actions ​“are hard to evade” civil rights activist and Rep. John R. Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) said at the outset of the Iraq War in 2003. ​“Would this be happening to [the Iraqis] if they were not nonwhite?” A Gallup poll at the time found 7 in 10 Black Americans opposed the war while 8 in 10 white Americans favored it.

“If these students weren’t worried about the cost of college would they be as apt to take a job at a defense contractor versus doing something else in their community?” —Astra Taylor

Joshua Myers an associate professor of Africana studies at Howard University an HBCU and author of We Are Worth Fighting For: A History of the Howard University Student Protest of 1989 notes the history of resistance to military recruiting at HBCUs. ​“Howard students shut down the university in 1925 over mandatory ROTC” he says. Today ROTC’s offers to HBCU students of a debt free education are mirrored by offers from the defense industry.



Lockheed has started STEM education and recruiting initiatives at 20 minority serving institutions (MSIs) including 16 HBCUs. Of Lockheed’s 2021 scholarship recipients 60% identified with a minority racial or ethnic group. In the 2020 to 2021 academic year more than 40% of Lockheed’s early-career hires identified as people of color with 450 coming from MSIs.



​“Students who work in these spaces don’t know the gravity — are systematically made ignorant of the gravity — of participating in these systems” says Myers.



The defense industry fills funding gaps for HBCUs which have endowments averaging 70% less than their non-HBCU counterparts. Howard has a formal partnership with Lockheed which sponsors the business school’s Cybersecurity Education & Research Center and is listed in the Trustees’ Circle of donors. In 2020 Lockheed was named the top industry supporter of HBCU engineering institutions for the seventh consecutive year by U.S. Black Engineer and Information Technology Magazine. Howard also hosts one of the country’s 25 chapters of Dissenters a youth-led antiwar group that launched in January 2020 with the ambitious goal of defunding the military.

In February 2020 Howard’s chapter posted a video of organizers passing out flyers and raising awareness about Lockheed outside of the College of Engineering as company representatives recruited students in the lobby.



​“You said that the CEO was an advocate for women and minorities” a student organizer says during a recruitment presentation. ​“How does she maintain that role as head of a company that produces weapons which bomb and kill women and children in places like Palestine Yemen Libya and the Middle East?”



The recruiter responds: ​“I have no idea.”

Easy money can be a tempting offer especially when all you have to do in return is place a sticker on your car.

That’s what several VERIFY readers say they were promised in text messages they received recently. One message promised as much as $1500 bi-weekly in exchange for putting a Dr. Pepper decal on a vehicle. Another said a beer company would pay $400 a week for allowing their “ad sticker” to go on a car or truck.

THE QUESTION

Are unsolicited text messages offering people money to put ads on their cars scams?

THE SOURCES

THE ANSWER

Yes unsolicited text messages offering money in exchange for putting ads on a car are scams.

WHAT WE FOUND

While there are legitimate companies that pay people to wrap their car with an advertisement the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and AARP says car wrap scams have grown increasingly popular and are used to trick victims into sending the scammer money.

A “wrap” is a large vinyl sticker or decal that goes over the paint job of a car says InSight Sign Company which specializes in wrapping vehicles. A wrap can cover the full vehicle or just part of the vehicle.



Here’s how it works: A person will message you offering money — often a few hundred dollars a week — to place a decal on your car or wrap it to advertise a company the FTC says. The company eventually sends you a check for a few thousand dollars telling you to keep your share and forward the rest to another company that will wrap your car.

But the check bounces sometimes a week later with a notice from your bank that the check is fake. The money you forwarded to the “other company” is gone and you’re on the hook for paying the bank back for the bounced check.

As for the text message a VERIFY viewer received about advertising Dr. Pepper on their vehicle that’s fake a Dr. Pepper spokesperson confirmed to VERIFY.

“We do not have any program offering to wrap cars in advertising graphics in exchange for compensation for any of our brands” said a spokesperson for Keurig Dr Pepper. “This is unfortunately a scam that uses the names of popular consumer brands to get people to respond.”

“If approached with such an offer consumers should not respond and most definitely do not send or wire money or provide their bank account number credit card number social security number or any other personal information and notify their local law enforcement immediately” the spokesperson added.

The AARP says complaints about these kinds of scams rose during the pandemic as millions found themselves without work. But there are several red flags that can indicate the offer you’re getting is a scam.

The FTC says that in all cases where you’re sent a check with instructions to send money back it’s a scam. These fake check or overpayment scams take advantage of a law that requires banks to make deposited funds available quickly. The bank will deposit money to your account before finding out the check is a fake which the bank may not learn for several days or weeks later.

“Finding out about a bad check can take weeks so it’s best to wait 30 days before spending the money from a check if you have any concerns about it” the Better Business Bureau (BBB) warned in a 2021 alert about car wrap scams.

The BBB says these scams often have the victim send money to the “other company” wrapping their car through a payment app like CashApp or Venmo. That’s one reason it’s a good idea to only use these money transfer apps to send money to people you personally know the BBB says.

The scam isn’t limited to cars either. The FTC says the scammer might make the offer to someone with a truck or motorcycle. The AARP says even ads on bicycles and boats are promoted by scammers.

Legitimate car wrapping companies such as Carvetise typically only make offers to people who have applied to participate first. Carvetise also only makes offers to people who meet certain requirements: a driver must drive at least 30 miles a day be licensed and insured own a 2009 car model or newer own a car with a factory finish paint job and be able to pass an interview and background check."

And it is not only because of Holi the festival of colors. Millions of families sit together in India every year to discuss the color of their new car.

Sometimes the conversation is over a wall painted on the occasion of a festival or a marriage. In sum colors aka paints make up an important part of the lives of Indians. Consequently the paint industry carries significance for the country’s GDP employment and investors.

In this article we shall go through an overview of the paint industry in India. After that we shall take a closer look at the largest two Indian paint manufacturing companies i.e. Asian Paints vs Berger Paints. Keep reading to find out!

Industry Overview

As per the data from Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities Research the global paints and coatings market stands at $160 billion. The Indian paints industry makes up 4.38% of that and has been growing faster than the global and developed markets.

Note: If you want to learn Candlesticks and Chart Trading from Scratch here’s the best book available on Amazon! Get the book now!

The industry is closely associated with GDP growth. For instance throughout history the Indian paint sector rise has been in the range of 1.5x and 2x of GDP. This can be easily understood as the overall economy grows increased income and industrial production lead to more consumption of paints and coatings.

Industry Division

We now have some idea of the size of the paints Industry. Let us now try to understand how the industry is structured.

In sum the industry gets divided into the decorative paint segment and industrial coatings segment. Therefore combined it is called the paints and coatings industry.

The decorative paints category includes several products like exterior wall paints interior wall paints wood finishes enamels and ancillary products such as primers putties etc.

The industrial segment finds applications across industries like automotive marine packaging powder protective and other usual industrial coatings.

Indian Paints and Coatings Industry

As per figures from Sherwin Williams Investor Presentation the Indian paint industry is valued at ₹ 62000 crores. The decorative paint segment accounts for almost 75% of that revenue. The industrial paints category makes up the balance of 25%. The automotive coatings market adds up to almost half of the industrial segment revenues in India.

Asian Paints Berger Paints Kansai Nerolac and Akzo Nobel are the four largest paint manufacturers in India. Together they control 65% of the overall paints and coatings market.

Talking about the segment-wise control their combined market share stands at 75% for the decorative paints vertical. However the industrial category is more fragmented with regional players on equal footing. The big four have a hold of 51% of the segment.

Smaller regional players make up the unorganized paint manufacturing market in India. They service the demand for lower-priced products and hold almost 35% of the total sector.

Raw Material Industry Growth and Future Prospects

Now we understand who’s who and what’s what in the industry. We shall now read to understand what are paints made up of. And what has been the track record of the industry as a whole.

The industry is sensitive to the prices of raw materials. More than 300 products are consumed and half of them are petroleum-based. Therefore the companies in the industry benefit when crude oil prices decline. At the same time rising crude prices eat into the profit margins of the manufacturers.

Excluding 2020 and 2021 the Indian paint industry has expanded in double digits historically. From 2014 to 2019 the sector recorded a CAGR of 11% revenue growth. It is one of the few mature industries that have grown fast supported by rising GDP and deeper penetration in non-metro markets.

India’s per capita consumption of paints is far behind the global average of 13-15 kgs. The country’s per capita consumption of paints was 4.1 kgs in the financial year 2018-19. From 2.6 kgs in FY12 it has increased at a CAGR of 7%. Growing disposable income of the middle class expanding rural market contraction of the repainting cycle and rising sale of high-end products are key factors backing the growth of the formal paint industry in India.

The sector is likely to see consolidation and formalization going forward. Along with setting up new greenfield plants most leading manufacturers have announced brownfield expansion plans. This will result in a healthy growth rate for the industry in the future.

In addition to this Aditya Birla Group-owned Grasim Industries has announced its foray into the paints industry. The company has earmarked an investment of ₹5000 crores over the next three years.

Industry Analysis

From what we have learned we understand that the industry has grown at a good pace in the past. Furthermore the low per capita consumption in the country offers a lot of headroom. Here we shall go in-depth and perform a SWOT analysis.

Strengths

Paints business enjoy goodwill and regular sales because of their brand name. This keeps the competition at bay. Along with this it must be noted that paint is a high-value product. Therefore famous and old names such as Asian Paints Berger and Nerolac are the first choice of the customers. Because of its sheer size Asian Paints has benefited from the cross-selling of various other products and services. More companies are following the suit making the moat stronger for the incumbents as they aspire to become well-integrated companies for interior decor.

Weaknesses

The sector is very dependent on the petroleum industry and margins get hit when crude oil prices climb. The marketing and distribution costs make up for a sizable portion of the expenses. Regional producers give stiff competition as they are able to save on these costs and provide lower-cost alternatives in an inflationary environment.

Opportunities

India’s per capita paint consumption is well behind those of developed nations. Not only this but it also lags behind the global average. This offers prospects of a consistent growth rate going forward. The players in the industry have been growing faster at the bottom of the pyramid and in tier 1 & 2 cities. Emulsions distempers and putties make up for the low-end products in the paints industry. This market is highly fragmented and dominated by regional producers. In the putties space cement companies have some control of the market. Focused marketing has helped the paint companies to scale quickly in terms of volume for this product range. Later over the years the same customer moves up the price ladder. Globally only 40% of the demand comes from the architectural category. The rest 60% is industrial consumption. Contrast this with India where 75% is decorative and 25% is industrial. The industrial demand for coatings will rise in the future further benefitted by various government initiatives.

Threats

The fragmented and unorganized sector still contributes to 35% of the demand in India. Except for the premium decorative market and high-ticket industrial market it offers competitive pricing with at-par products.

Asian Paints Vs Berger Paints India – History and Overview

For the purpose of this article we will restrict the coverage to India’s two largest paint producers: Asian Paints and Berger Paints India.

Asian Paints Ltd. is a multinational paints company based out of Mumbai India. It is India’s largest Asia’s 3rd largest paint manufacturer and the world’s 9th largest producer. The company was started in the 1940s by four friends.

It has 26 paint manufacturing plants with operations across 15 countries.

Berger Paints India is also an Indian paint manufacturing company. It is owned by Kuldip Singh and Gurbachan Singh Dhingra. The billionaire siblings hold a 75% stake in the company which they acquired from liquor-baron Vijay Mallya in the 1990s.

Berger has a longer history than Asian paints as it was started in 1923. It saw multiple ownership changes till it came into the hands of the Dhingra brothers.

It has 16 manufacturing plants across four countries: Russia Poland Nepal and Bangladesh.

Asian Paints Vs Berger Paints – Product Offerings

With the premiumization of the industries the companies in the industry have augmented their product offerings. They offer a broad range of use-specific solutions in the paints and coatings space.

Lately paint manufacturers have also started expanding beyond their core product offerings of paints and coatings.

Asian Paints offers a gamut of products and services. Its chief offerings include paints wall coverings and waterproofing. Along with the company also sells wall stickers mechanized tools adhesives modular kitchens and wardrobes bath fittings sanitaryware sanitisers disinfectants furniture furnishings & lighting services interior design services and other solutions.

As compared to Asian Paints Berger’s non-paints and coatings offerings are limited to sanitisers disinfectants and express painting service.

Asian Paints Vs Berger Paints – Business Overview

Having come this far we are now well equipped to understand the two companies and their businesses. Henceforth we shall study in-depth about the two companies.

In the first step we shall how these two companies differ in different aspects. Later we shall have a closer look at their numbers.

For the financial year 2022 the company reported a total income of ₹ 29101 crores. Decorative business accounts for roughly 85% of the group’s revenue. Presently the kitchen & bath segment and industrial segment make up 2.5% of each of the revenues. The balance of 10% is Asian paints international revenue.

This makes it India’s largest paint company with a 40% combined market share and 55% in the decorative paint category.

The company has set up two 50:50 joint ventures with PPG Inc the USA to cater to the industrial coatings market. One is focused on automotive coatings. The other one services the protective industrial powder industrial containers and light industrial coatings demand.

Furthermore the home decorative products and services business accounted for 4% of the total decorative revenue of the company. This makes a strong case for the future diversification efforts of the company beyond its usual paints and coatings revenue.

The total revenue of Berger Paints was ₹ 7804 crores for the financial year 2022. This makes the company almost 1/3rd of the size of Asian Paints. Berger is second in line after Asian Paints with a 12% market share in India. The company derives 80% of its revenue from decorative pigments and roughly 20% comes from industrial paints.

The non-paints line of Berger contains only painting services. Similar to Asian Paints Berger provides consultancy and express painting services. Since the segment-wise information was not available the proportion of this must be small in comparison to the consolidated sales of the company.

Asian Paints Vs Berger Paints – Revenue Growth

The revenues of both companies have grown at a steady rate. For the last 7 years the revenues of Asian Paints have grown at a CAGR of 10.83%. Over the same period Berger Paints saw a revenue CAGR of 9.36%.

Asian Paints Vs Berger Paints – Profit Growth

On the profitability growth front Berger Paints has outperformed Asian Paints. The net profit of Berger Paints grew at a CAGR of 12.91% over the last seven years.

Whereas those of Asian Paints grew at a CAGR of 8.90%.

Historically Asian Paints has been reluctant to pass increased costs to customers. Consequently during multiple quarters the company’s margins would take a hit. Furthermore Asian Paints has been diversifying its product lines. Its non-paints products and services have comparatively lower profit margins. Hence the consolidated profit figure growth remains under pressure.

Asian Paints Vs Berger Paints – Key Metrics

Asian Paints is almost three times the size of Berger Paints in terms of revenues and 4.5x of market capitalization. It commands a higher valuation than its counterpart because of its sheer size and geography & product-led diversified revenues.

Particulars Asian Paints Berger Paints Face Value (₹) 1 1 Net Profit Margin (%) 10.41 9.69 Operating Profit Margin (%) 17.92 16.09 EPS (₹) 31.6 7.72 ROE (%) 21.94 21.2 Market Cap (₹ Cr) 265000 56500 Promoter’s Holdings (%) 53 75 Dividend Yield (%) 0.69 0.54 Debt/Equity Ratio 0.06 0.26 Current Ratio 2 1.42 CMP (₹) 2765 575 Stock P/E 88 74 Book Value 144 40 Price to Book Value 19 14 7 Year Stock Returns 19.92 16.48

Across different metrics Asian Paints appears to be a better company. Whether it be almost nil debt to equity ratio or short-term current ratio. Furthermore the company has demonstrated better margins and return on equity.

Subsequently this is also inherent in the 7-year average stock returns of both companies. The investors of Asian Paints have gained more compared to those of Berger Paints. The stock has benefited from the economies of scale lesser risk due to product diversification faster revenue growth and various other factors.

In Closing

Thomas Sieren 59 was the vice president of TCS Fabricating Inc. in Keswick when he allegedly failed to turn over $440000 to the IRS between 2016 and 2020 according to charging documents.

Sieren also allegedly submitted two Paycheck Protection Program loan applications in which he falsely claimed that the company had employees for whom it paid payroll taxes.

Sieren made an initial appearance in federal court Friday according to a spokesperson for the Des Moines U.S. Attorney.

The company was required by law to withhold taxes from employee wages and to pay the withheld amounts to the Internal Revenue Service on a periodic basis.

These taxes also known as ""trust fund taxes"" include income taxes and the taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare.

But according to charges Sieren never forwarded the funds to the IRS. An IRS spokesperson declined to comment on what happened to any money that had been withheld from employees’ paychecks.

""Employees usually are not liable for the under or nonpayment of their employment tax as long as they are correctly and timely filing their individual tax returns each year"" IRS Special Agent Leslie Anderson said. ""If guilty the defendant/employer usually has to pay restitution to the IRS which covers those lost amounts.""

Anderson said that not paying employment taxes ""could also negatively affect employees’ retirement payments via the Social Security Administration if those wages are not reported to SSA either"" but declined to say whether that happened in this case.

""Business owners are required to withhold income taxes for their employees and remit those taxes to the IRS"" Special Agent in Charge Tyler Hatcher of the IRS criminal investigation division St. Louis field office said in a news release. ""IRS Criminal Investigation takes these crimes very seriously not only because of the impact on federal revenue but more importantly because of the way employee benefits are impacted.""

Sieren is charged with 20 counts of Failure to Collect Account for and Pay Over Trust Fund Taxes two counts of Bank Fraud and two counts of False Statements to a Financial Institution. If convicted he faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison.

Wapello man sentenced for failing to file income taxes

Sieren's initial appearance came just days after another Iowa man was sentenced to six months in prison for failing to file income tax returns.

Bradley Earl Ewart 51 of Wapello was sentenced Aug. 1 to six months in prison. Ewart had pleaded guilty on March 24 to two counts of failure to file income tax returns one for each of the calendar years 2016 and 2018.

The court imposed a three-month prison sentence on each count to be served consecutively. Following his prison term Ewart will be on supervised release for one year. He also faces a $20000 fine.

""Mr. Ewart is a prime example of a taxpayer who has learned from his mistakes and is moving forward in compliance with his tax obligations"" Ewart's attorney Patrick Mullin said.

Since about 2004 Ewart has owned and operated Louisa County Millwright LLC a company that specializes in grain elevator work material handling steel building installation and fabrication.

Ewart failed to file federal income tax returns for the years 2004 to 2014 according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Iowa. As part of his plea Ewart admitted that he knowingly and willfully failed to file tax returns for the years 2015 2016 2017 and 2018. He will be responsible for paying his tax liability in full.

""Mr. Ewart admitted that he repeatedly failed to file his federal income tax returns the majority of the time his business was in operation"" said IRS-Criminal Investigation Special Agent in Charge Tyler Hatcher in a news release.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.

Pramila Jayapal (WA-07)

After more than a year of negotiations Senate Democrats finally passed a historic reconciliation bill. The Inflation Reduction Act lowers health care costs begins to ensure that corporations pay their fair share and makes the largest-ever federal investment to tackle the existential threat of climate change. While we’re heartbroken to see the care economy housing and immigration left on the cutting room floor we should be very clear that the Inflation Reduction Act takes real steps forward on key progressive priorities. Progressives in Congress and movements across the country should feel very proud of our part in getting to this point: had progressives not held the line a year ago insisting on real negotiations and an actual Build Back Better bill passing the House we would not be where we are. Major pieces of that bill are now in the Inflation Reduction Act — about to become law. It’s an achievement we can all feel excited about — especially when we dig into the details.

The bill will put the United States on track to cut carbon pollution by 40 percent by 2030 through rapidly accelerating the adoption of renewable energy technologies such as electric vehicles heat pumps and solar panels saving the average family $1025 a year in energy costs and creating 9 million good jobs. It includes roughly $60 billion for environmental justice going to frontline communities. The bill allows nonprofit and public utilities for the first time to receive direct payments from the federal government to rapidly adopt renewable energy production and invests billions so utilities and rural co-ops can retire coal-fired power plants improving air quality for frontline communities and saving lives.

Progressives have been clear: we don’t support the provisions that expand fossil fuel leasing — but critically independent analyses show that their limited impact will be far outweighed by the bill’s carbon emissions cuts. Under a worst-case scenario the Inflation Reduction Act will remove 24 tons of pollution for every ton produced by new oil and gas leases.

When we pass the Inflation Reduction Act Friday 13 million people will immediately see their affordable health insurance coverage extended. The bill will cap seniors’ yearly drug costs at $2000 per year and insulin at $35 per month for those on Medicare. For the first time ever Medicare can begin negotiating prices for a small group of drugs that expands over time. After years of fighting for legislation to take on Big Pharma Democrats are standing up to one of the nation’s richest and most powerful lobbying forces.

In a win for progressive economic policy the investments in this bill are paid for by finally beginning to make the wealthy pay their fair share. The bill imposes a 15 percent minimum tax on corporations taxes corporations that inflate their share values through stock buybacks and invests in the IRS to go after large corporations and wealthy individuals (those who make over $400000 per year) who evade taxes. As President Biden promised the bill won’t raise taxes on any family making less than $400000 per year.

This isn’t just good policy — the Inflation Reduction Act has overwhelming public support. Polling from Data for Progress finds that 73% of Americans support the bill including majorities of Democrats Independents and Republicans. The majority of Democrats and Independents support the climate provisions of this bill — and for many of the clean energy components so do the majority of Republicans. The majority of all Americans are more likely to support the bill when they hear about its carbon-pollution-cutting power.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUub3JnL21hZ2F6aW5lL2d1bGYtbWV4aWNvLWRlYWQtem9uZS1qb2huc29uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nothing Here Gets Out Alive - Progressive.org,"With an easy drawl Dean Blanchard the owner of Dean Blanchard Seafood in the barrier-island town of Grand Isle Louisiana makes an understated observation: “There’s a reason they call it a dead zone. When the dead zone comes everything’s dead. We can’t catch dead stuff. We’re in the live stuff business.”

What Blanchard is talking about is the Gulf of Mexico “dead zone” an enormous area in which every spring an overgrowth of algae and other vegetation absorbs dissolved oxygen from the water and kills all animal life. The dead zone is staggeringly large covering an average of 5380 square miles. In 2017 the zone mushroomed to an astonishing 8776 square miles—as big as the state of New Jersey. In that area no aquatic life can survive.

“This year” Blanchard says “we had shrimp jumping on the beach committing suicide trying to get out of the water because there’s no oxygen.”

The result is an economic disaster. To find live shrimp fishers have to ply their boats as far as fifty miles from shore. “With the price of fuel you don’t want to go too far” Blanchard says. His company’s annual haul has declined from twelve million pounds of shrimp a year to under five million. He used to employ sixty workers—now he’s down to thirty.

Blanchard’s woes are far from unique. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration “Harmful algal blooms and hypoxia cost the U.S. seafood and tourism industries approximately $82 million per year.”

Expand Dean Blanchard Seafood “We had shrimp jumping on the beach committing suicide trying to get out of the water because there’s no oxygen” says Dean Blanchard who runs his seafood company out of Grand Isle Louisiana.

Two nutrients are primarily responsible for creating the dead zone: nitrogen and phosphorus. They run off from farm fields in enormous quantities into the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers and their numerous tributaries and flow into the Gulf. The result is eutrophication an excessive amount of nutrients that stimulate rapid and dense growth of plant life. As plant life decays it sinks deeper into the Gulf and bacteria consume the plants. As the bacteria do so they draw dissolved oxygen from the water causing hypoxia or a low level of oxygen making it impossible for animal life to survive.

The result? Environmental and economic disasters—not only in the Gulf but also throughout the Mississippi River Basin. Matt Rota senior policy director for Healthy Gulf in New Orleans explains: “Because of this nitrogen and phosphorus pollution you have increased levels of toxic algae—blue-green algae [also known as harmful algal blooms]—in some of these areas. That’s a problem we see throughout the Mississippi River Basin because this much pollution leads to constant algae blooms which can cause aesthetic issues drinking water issues and toxicity.”

Rota continues “For example there have been studies on the Atlantic croaker in the Gulf and when they get into these areas of low oxygen this causes problems with reproduction and sexual dimorphism where the sexual system goes from male to female. There’s an endocrine disruption.”

The amounts of nitrogen and phosphorous in the Mississippi River Basin have exploded over the past several decades for four reasons:

Wastewater treatment plants fail to remove all of the phosphorus and nitrogen from treated water.

Concentrated animal feeding operations or CAFOs produce enormous amounts of manure which can spill over and carry nitrogen and other chemicals into adjoining rivers and streams.

Industrial agriculture employs vast amounts of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. According to Trevor Russell the water program director at Friends of the Mississippi River based in St. Paul Minnesota “The largest source of nutrient pollution to the Mississippi River Basin broadly speaking is from agricultural runoff from cropland fertilization.”

Through erosion nutrient-laden sediment seeps into waterways.

Several factors make nutrient pollution tough to manage and regulate. The pollutants flow into the Gulf from the entire Mississippi River Basin which covers 1.2 million square miles.

The sources of the pollution are highly decentralized; we’re talking about thousands of farms wastewater treatment plants and CAFOs spread over hundreds of thousands of square miles.

In addition the Clean Water Act of 1972 allows the federal government to regulate point-source water pollution—pollution that comes from a specific source such as a pipe. But the law does not include effective regulation of nonpoint sources which entail diffuse sources such as nutrient pollutants running off agricultural lands. As a result Rota explains “In the vast majority of the Mississippi River states there are not even numeric standards for nitrogen and phosphorus.”

By the late 1990s it was clear that something had to be done to restore the Gulf to ecological health. In 1997 twelve states and five federal agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Tribal Water Council which represents American Indian and Alaska Native tribes formed the Hypoxia Task Force to develop and coordinate strategies for reducing nutrient pollution in the Mississippi River Basin. The twelve states are Arkansas Illinois Indiana Iowa Kentucky Louisiana Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Ohio Tennessee and Wisconsin.

The task force aimed to shrink the Gulf dead zone from an average size of almost 6000 square miles to about 2000 square miles by 2035. To do so they agreed to reduce total nitrogen and phosphorus loads flowing into the Gulf by 45 percent by 2035 with an interim goal of 20 percent reduction by 2025. By January 2017 all twelve of the states had written nutrient reduction strategies.

Since the task force’s formation some states have successfully reduced the amount of phosphorus and nitrogen emitted by wastewater treatment plants a process that requires upgrading treatment systems.

In Illinois the largest source of phosphorus and the second-largest source of nitrogen in the Mississippi River Basin wastewater treatment plants and other plants in the point-source sector have tripled capital investments to $185.2 million in 2020 to improve nutrient removal and control sewer overflows. By 2020 the state had reduced phosphorus loads in its waterways by 16 percent from 2011 levels. The reduction has occurred because the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency lists bodies of water that are impaired or polluted. The agency develops total maximum daily loads which set maximum limits on pollutant loads including phosphorus and nitrogen. The Illinois EPA then issues permits and through this permitting process the state has required wastewater treatment plants to reduce nutrients in treated water.

Expand Susan Webb

In Minnesota Friends of the Mississippi River’s Trevor Russell explains “The Metro Council operates seven plants in the Twin Cities metropolitan area. Those facilities have had about an 88 percent reduction in total phosphorus in the Mississippi River just since 2000.” This progress has happened because the nutrients from wastewater treatment plants are point-source pollutants and as a result are regulated under the auspices of the Clean Water Act.

However CAFOs and industrial agriculture continue to be enormous sources of nutrient pollution. Matthew Sheets a policy organizer with the Land Stewardship Project a nonprofit based in Minneapolis Minnesota that promotes sustainable agriculture says “The reason why CAFOs are typically more dangerous for water quality is that they use what are called manure lagoons to hold their manure. There have been multiple instances of manure lagoons overflowing. When we had a lot of water earlier this year there were manure lagoons in South Dakota that were reported to have overflowed.” The Union of Concerned Scientists estimates that CAFOs contribute about 15 percent of the nutrient pollution that creates the Gulf dead zone.

But as problematic as CAFOs are farmland pollution remains the largest source of nutrient pollution. Alicia Vasto the water program associate director for the Iowa Environmental Council a nonprofit in Des Moines notes that “there has been a lack of progress for a couple of reasons. The major reason is that there’s a big vested interest on behalf of major agricultural companies that want to continue to sell fertilizer and seed and pesticides. Any kind of discussion about mandatory measures or regulations is heavily opposed by those big agricultural interests. That’s really the only way we’re going to see actual real progress in addressing nutrient pollution.”

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the twelve member states of the Hypoxia Task Force have all taken steps to encourage agricultural practices that reduce nutrient runoff from agricultural lands. Applying fertilizers in the correct amounts and at the right times of the year can reduce runoff. Farmers can plant cover crops such as alfalfa rye and clover to improve soil health and reduce erosion and runoff. Farmers can also decrease how often they till the land. Most farmlands in the Midwest have drainage tiles to carry excess water into adjoining streams. And farmers can place woodchip bioreactors which absorb nitrates before they are released into waterways into these drainage tiles.

All of these measures are voluntary—and they have all fallen short. According to Indra Frank the environmental health and water policy director for the Hoosier Environmental Council in Indiana “[T]he percent of Indiana cropland using no-till remained essentially unchanged from 2005 to 2019 at 38 percent and the percent of Indiana cropland using cover crops . . . actually dropped to 8 percent in 2019” Civil Eats reported.

Yet despite the lack of progress one state—Minnesota—has emerged as a leader in promoting progressive agricultural practices that reduce nutrient runoff. In 2015 the state legislature passed a law requiring farm fields to have buffer zones of perennial vegetation of up to fifty feet along lakes rivers and streams. The buffers filter out nitrogen phosphorus and sediment before runoff enters waterways.

In addition Russell explains “What we need is to embrace the concept of continuous living cover.” He’s talking about regenerative agriculture which reduces fertilizer use and restores soil health in ways that enhance farm income. Donald Wyse professor and co-director of the Center for Integrated Natural Resources and Agricultural Management at the University of Minnesota is developing practical applications of regenerative agriculture The New York Times reported. In 2012 he co-founded the Forever Green Initiative with the goal of keeping plants in the ground year-round rather than having the soil lie bare to the elements and vulnerable to runoff.

Russell gives examples of new cover crops that can enhance farmers’ income improve soil health and reduce nutrient runoff. The first is camelina an oil seed that farmers can plant into standing corn in late summer. “Instead of barren soil for miles and miles” Russell explains “you’ve got green lush camelina that will sprout and produce oil seed. That oil seed can be used as an edible fuel or a heavy industry biofuel or a biodiesel fuel.” In addition the farmer benefits from three harvests instead of the two traditional harvests of corn and soybeans.

The second example is Kernza a perennial wheat. Above the soil it grows like a traditional wheat crop but below the soil it acts as a prairie plant with a sixteen-feet-deep root system. Farmers plant it once and for the next three four or even five years the farmer has a wheat harvest. During those years the farmer isn’t tilling or fertilizing and there is a living cover on the field year-round.

Russell says “In both of these cases you’ve got the attributes we’re looking for. It’s market-based. There’s going to be some additional public support necessary to help build out supply chains and generate market demand. Once that market becomes self-sustaining you don’t need public subsidies as you do for traditional crops.”

Yet despite this promising research the fact remains that in the twenty-five years since the formation of the Hypoxia Task Force precious little progress has been made. “The EPA should take a strong leadership role in this” the Iowa Environmental Council’s Alicia Vasto asserts “but they haven’t put enough pressure on the states.”

Congress might be starting to realize that the federal government has to take a stronger leading role to save the Gulf. In June the EPA announced that it will provide $60 million in funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to reduce nutrient pollution.

And in 2021 Representative Betty McCollum Democrat of Minnesota introduced the Mississippi River Restoration and Resilience Initiative which would authorize annual spending of up to $350 million to restore the ecological health of the Mississippi River Basin. This bill would provide funds to reduce urban and agricultural runoff remove invasive species improve erosion control provide habitat for native species and restore the natural hydrology of the Mississippi River. The proposed bill is modeled after the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative a bipartisan law that has devoted billions of dollars to cleaning up the Great Lakes.

What’s happening to the Gulf of Mexico is the end result of an insidious trend toward industrial agriculture over the past several decades. The Land Stewardship Project’s Matthew Sheets says “We are losing farmers. The system is working against the small and midsized farms.” For that reason the Land Stewardship Project has undertaken grassroots organizing against CAFOs. He says “Over forty years we have successfully pushed back against forty different factory farms. We’ve done that by grassroots organizing with people who ask us to come into their community and help them.”

A blend of stronger federal leadership scientific research for regenerative agriculture and community organizing offers hope that progress can finally be made to restore the Gulf of Mexico to ecological health.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmdGVybWFya2V0bmV3cy5jb20vbmdrLXNwYXJrLXBsdWdzLXUtcy1hLWluYy10by1jaGFuZ2UtY29tcGFueS1uYW1lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NGK Spark Plugs (U.S.A.)

The name change follows the strategy to unify the global brand NGK Spark Plug Co. LTD which will begin operating under the English tradename Niterra Co. LTD next April. The Japanese language corporate name will not change.

“As we prepare create and lead our company into the future we continue to grow and expand inside and outside the automotive business and other ICE industries” said Michael Schwab president and CEO. “We are becoming an increasingly progressive corporation as we strive to meet our vision for the future. However it became apparent several years ago that our global corporations’ name in English although very well established presented certain limitations creating a narrow image of our identity to the outside world and not lending itself to evolution.”

The new name not specific to spark plugs combines the Latin words Niteo shine and Terra planet earth reflecting the company’s future vision and already expanding portfolio of products and services. The company has been preparing and creating for the future for some time most recently with the development of the Venture Lab which contributes to society by developing solutions to customer pain points. In addition the team identifies and curates new ideas in the areas of Mobility Medical and Utilities.

The company will not change the brand of their products with this transition stating the NGK and NTK brands will remain the trusted brands of their portfolio or products. However other brands may be added in the future as they continue to evolve.

“This is an exciting time for our company. We are expanding our core ceramic technologies and challenging ourselves to develop solutions and services that use technologies to resolve social issues while contributing to a sustainable society.

But the climate and food crises are not isolated phenomena. They are the result of a global capitalist system – and a neoliberal agenda – that has prioritised big corporate agricultural profits over people and the planet.

“Most farmers can no longer produce adequate food for their families” says Vladimir Chilinya. “Profit-making entities control our food systems… including the production and distribution of seed.”

Chilinya is a Zambian coordinator for FIAN International an organisation that campaigns for the democratisation of food and nutrition.

Worsening harvests infertile soil and increasing food poverty are affecting the majority of small farmers across the globe especially in the Global South. Wheat prices have surged by 59% since the start of 2022.

In May UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres warned that the number of people living in famine conditions has increased by more than 500% since 2016 and more than 270 million people are now living in extreme food insecurity.

While Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated this crisis (Russia and Ukraine account for 30% of the world’s wheat exports constituting 12% of traded calories) climate change and capitalism are the primary engines behind this global food emergency.

The IPCC has estimated that by 2030 global warming will have diminished the world’s average agricultural production by more than a fifth. In Zambia the maize harvest for 2021/22 is expected to be down by a quarter thanks to droughts and flash floods between 2019 and 2021 according to the Ministry of Agriculture.

Meanwhile India and Pakistan experienced their highest recorded temperatures in March and April since records began 122 years ago. India has since banned wheat exports (after the government failed to buy enough wheat to cover its food security programme) which has further exacerbated the global wheat shortage and soaring global food prices.

But the climate and food crises are not isolated phenomena. They are the result of a global capitalist system – and a neoliberal agenda – that has prioritised big corporate agricultural profits over people and the planet.

Corporatisation of agriculture

This process really took shape during the so-called “Green Revolution” in India in the late 1960s. This movement was a collaboration between India and the US (with USAID and the Ford Foundation being key actors) and was dependent on agrochemical usage and intensive plant breeding.

High-yielding hybrid crops were introduced – the main one being IR8 a semi-dwarf rice variety – alongside the use of fertilisers pesticides and lots of groundwater (these high-yielding crops required a lot more water). Calorific food was valued over nutrition and these foods had costly inputs.

This shift towards big agriculture and more profitable monocultures made small farmers more dependent on expensive chemical fertilisers forcing them into ever greater levels of debt. In India 10677 agricultural workers were reported to have taken their own lives in 2020 many of them farmers trapped by mounting debts resulting from the high costs of these farming inputs.

Unfair terms of trade and global lending – enforced by multilateral financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) – are also to blame.

Structural adjustment programmes (SAPs) introduced by the World Bank following the debt crisis across Latin America and Africa after the 1979 oil crisis coerced poorer countries into privatising their public sectors and reducing their welfare mechanisms.

Adhering to strict policy packages in nearly every key sector – from agriculture to education and healthcare – became compulsory in exchange for any future loans from the bank or the IMF.

SAPs meant indebted countries across the Global South had to convert from prioritising indigenous crops that the local population depended on to producing cash crops for export. As a result local populations and farmers became more vulnerable to food scarcity – due to the negative ecological effects and decline in food accessibility.

Zambia: seed privatisation

In Zambia for example the structural adjustment agenda included the privatisation and liberalisation of the seed system. It began with the liberalisation and deregulation of ZAMSEED in the mid-1990s which led to a decline in support for farmer cooperatives. In addition the priority of maize as a cash crop has led to a decline in crop variety meaning the local population has fewer food sources available.

“Under recent policy changes priority is given to maize production. This is one of the key drivers for monocropping which is responsible for the reduction in varieties of available foods in Zambia” Chiliniya from FIAN told openDemocracy.

FIAN is documenting how the corporate control of agriculture is weakening food security. Seed systems have gone from being cooperative-led (which gives farmers more agency and fair prices) to being corporate-led (which prioritises profits).

“Farmer-managed seed systems have been replaced by commercial seed systems” Chilinya said. “Most smallholder farmers are unable to purchase seeds at the commercial price and hence they cannot grow any food.”

These commercial seeds are also more vulnerable to extreme weather conditions. “Most people focus on cash crops at the expense of other crops that are more resilient to extensive weather changes. In the wake of extreme weather changes like those experienced in 2020 and 2021 the country falls into a food shortage” added Chiliniya. According to the World Food Programme (WPF) 48% of the Zambian population is unable to meet minimum calorie requirements.

Kenya: food crisis

openDemocracy also spoke with food justice activists in Kenya which is experiencing a severe food crisis. “Land degradation is affecting food production in Kenya because of the overuse of chemical fertilisers” said Leondia Odongo co-founder of social justice organisation Haki Nawiri Afrika.

As in Zambia the disastrous legacy of SAPs is to blame. In 1980 Kenya was one of the first countries to receive a structural adjustment loan from the World Bank. It was conditional on reducing essential subsidies for farmer inputs such as fertilisers. This process instigated a shift towards farming cash crops for export such as tea coffee and tobacco instead of farming key staples for the local population such as maize wheat and rice.

“Agricultural inputs that were previously provided to farmers free of charge went into the hands of private entities under the guise of efficiency” Odongo explained. “This has resulted in smallholder farmers being abandoned to the mercy of transnational corporations in the seed and agrochemical industry which dupe farmers with information about seeds and chemicals.”

A recent report by Save the Children and Oxfam found that 3.5 million people in Kenya are already suffering crisis levels of hunger – and this is likely to rise to five million. Meanwhile only 2% of the $4.4bn required in humanitarian aid (for Kenya Ethiopia and Somalia) has been funded.

Structural adjustment has made Kenya into a food exporter. In the country malnutrition remains concerningly high with 29% of children in rural areas and 20% of children in cities being stunted. Despite experiencing deficits which threaten its population’s food security Kenya remains a vital food exporter with major exports in tea coffee vegetables and cut flowers.

Keep it small and local

Despite occupying less than 25% of the world’s farmland small-scale farmers provide 70% of the world’s food. In Kenya Haki Nawiri Afrika is resisting the corporatisation of agriculture by assisting local farmers with technical knowledge. Teaching smallholder farmers practical skills allows them to reclaim agency over their land and crops.

In Zambia FIAN is helping small farmers return to indigenous farming practices and seeds to build resilience and improve food security. By diversifying food systems and abandoning monocultures small farmers can continue to provide enough food for their communities and at lower costs.

These small farmer movements are up against ‘Big Philanthropy’ such as the controversial Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation which is replicating the Green Revolution corporate-first strategy.

Still they hope their struggle to decommodify and rebuild a sustainable relationship with the land can help realise the UN’s second sustainable development goal: ending hunger by 2030.

Logistics real estate giant Prologis recently predicted an additional 800 million square feet of U.S. warehouse space will be required beyond earlier projections to handle excess inventories.

NPD’s recent monthly “Global Port Tracker” report indicated that a slowdown in cargo from Chinese factories facing pandemic-related lockdowns gave West Coast ports a chance to clear built-up congestion.

Inventory build-ups across retail however are being attributed largely to softening demand from consumers in the face of skyrocketing inflation and as spending shifts to experiences (i.e. travel eating out). The elevated inventories also reflect the fact that stores are bulking up on orders as a precaution against supply chain disruptions including a potential West Coast port strike.

The vacancy rate for U.S. warehouses is the lowest in decades at around three percent overall and close to one percent near ports according to Warehouse Quote’s “Warehouse Pricing Index” (WPI).

Warehouse rents have also increased 20 percent year-over-year in the second quarter due to warehouse shortages according to Prologis. Steve Denton CEO of Ware2Go a UPS-owned third-party fulfillment services provider told DC Velocity “That means the margin evaporates if you carry [inventory] too long.”

Efforts to quickly add warehouses could face challenges due to shortages of steel and other construction materials higher land costs and interest rate hikes.

Retail options to avoid paying for a warehouse premium include using stores as mini-fulfillment centers although costs and executional challenges have to be overcome. Retailers are also exploring flexible or alternative warehousing such as using vacant stores.

Retailers will have to balance the benefits of carrying extra inventory including avoiding holiday stock-outs against the costs. Some supply chain observers feel ongoing efforts to reduce prices cancel orders and sell unwanted goods to off-pricers or liquidators will help rebalance excess stocks without requiring a warehouse building boom.

Chris Caplice executive director of Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Transportation and Logistics told The Wall Street Journal. “I don’t think it’s going to be like we need to double the amount of warehouse space.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWlnaHR3YXZlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnN0YWxsaW5nLWxlZHMtZ2l2ZXMtd2FyZWhvdXNlcy1jaGVhcGVyLWNsZWFuZXItbGlnaHRpbmctZXhwZXJ0cy1zYXnSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmVpZ2h0d2F2ZXMuY29tL25ld3MvaW5zdGFsbGluZy1sZWRzLWdpdmVzLXdhcmVob3VzZXMtY2hlYXBlci1jbGVhbmVyLWxpZ2h0aW5nLWV4cGVydHMtc2F5L2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Installing LEDs gives warehouses cheaper cleaner lighting experts say,"Many people have switched to LED lights in their homes because they know how much money and energy it saves. So why haven’t companies with huge warehouses around the world done the same?

It’s not as simple as it may seem. “An LED retrofit is a disruptive retrofit” Sam Stockdale senior vice president and head of sustainability at last-mile logistics real estate company Link Logistics told FreightWaves.

It often requires coordination between tenants and landlords changes to leases or contracts and optimal timing to reduce disruptions to warehouse operations.

But the environmental benefits of LED lighting are substantial and in many instances the economic benefits make it financially well worth the investment.

Cost energy emissions savings of LED lighting

Lighting is “one of the largest electrical loads in warehouses and distribution centers” Rafat Shehadeh global head of essentials and procurement at supply chain real estate company Prologis told FreightWaves. So improving energy efficiency can have a big impact on electricity costs.

According to the Department of Energy LEDs use 75% less energy than incandescent bulbs. The main reason for the energy savings is that incandescent bulbs release 90% of the energy generated through heat not light the DOE said. CFLs another type of bulb lose about 80% of energy as heat.

LED lighting minimizes maintenance needs reduces lamp and ballast replacement frequency and can save up to 83% on energy when accompanied by wireless networked controls or occupancy sensors according to Inbound Logistics.

LEDs last up to 25 times longer than other types of bulbs according to the DOE. “That means your employee is on a ladder replacing that bulb 25 times less often. That’s extra time that can be put toward higher-value work” Saleh Elhattab founder and CEO of emissions tracking software provider Gravity Climate told FreightWaves.





“Given the energy labor and cost benefits switching to LEDs is a smart move for any supply chain company” Elhattab said. But some leaders don’t realize the benefits until they find out they can save $10000 $20000 or even $100000 by switching to LED lighting he added.

Shehadeh said Prologis customers with LED retrofits “benefit from keeping all the energy savings operating more sustainably and having their team enjoy a brighter workspace.”

There is also the potential for job creation from switching over. For every million dollars in investments and spending in efficient new buildings and in making efficiency retrofits in existing buildings 14 to 15 jobs are created according to a 2020 Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction report.

The split incentive barrier

Many warehouses operate within the triple net leasing model Stockdale said. That means the landlord gets a base rate for rent and logistics companies that rent are responsible for paying for their own utilities among other costs.

If landlords paid for LED retrofits they would not benefit financially from the energy savings since their tenants pay for electricity. In this case landlords have little incentive to make the investment.

One solution to this so-called split incentive barrier is performance contracting. Landlords can partner with energy service companies which pay for the upfront cost of the LED installation. Energy service companies foot the bill with the expectation that it will be paid off using the saved money from more efficient lighting.

Another solution is to use green leasing to make addenda to leases. If a landlord pays for an LED retrofit a change in the lease can make tenants pay a fixed amount for the upgrade. This splits the energy-saving benefits of switching to more efficient lighting.

Timing challenges

The payback period for an LED retrofit is typically three to five years depending on the cost of electricity and the amount of time the warehouse is operational Stockdale said. A warehouse that’s in an area with high electricity costs that runs 24/7 is going to recoup the costs much faster than a warehouse running one shift a day with lower electricity costs.





The average lease length for Link Logistics’ customers is three to five years Stockdale said. This may discourage warehouse renters from pursuing LEDs because they may have to move locations before they would see the energy savings.

Retrofitting warehouses also takes time and space.

“We have a lot of customers that operate two or three shifts and some customers operate 24/7” Stockdale said. He said bringing in scissor lifts that can reach the 25-foot or 35-foot ceilings to change out the bulbs takes away a significant amount of square footage.

Some of the retrofits are done at night at facilities that don’t run 24/7 but that increases the labor costs for installation. LED retrofits are often not considered at all between October and January because warehouses can’t handle additional disruptions during the holiday season Stockdale added.

Companies making strides

Prologis has a target to install 100% LED lighting in all warehouses and office spaces by 2025.

“We’ve been working to upgrade our facilities with LED lighting since 2016 and have installed LED lighting across 57% of our global portfolio to date. While we’ve been focused on making the switch it requires close coordination with our customers” Shehadeh said.

“We work in lockstep with our customers when upgrading an occupied facility to avoid disrupting their operations and not to strain our install supply chain. We also convert facilities when they become vacant which doesn’t happen often.”

Prologis has been in business for nearly 40 years so it is one of the companies leading the way Stockdale said. Link Logistics is rapidly catching up to Prologis’ progress in LED retrofits but it was only established in 2019. Link Logistics works with 7000 tenants at 3500 buildings. The process of transitioning them all to LEDs takes time.

Schneider’s latest sustainability report said the company has been upgrading to LEDs throughout its facilities. But it did not mention how much of Schneider’s lighting comes from LEDs or when the transition will be complete. Schneider did not respond to a request for comment.

LEDs or renewable energy first?

When it comes to considering LED lighting and renewable energy Stockdale said it’s important to follow the “age-old sustainability formula.”

“The formula is very simple: It’s measure reduce offset. It actually is that simple” Stockdale said. “If you’re not following that you’re actually not being a good steward of your customers’ operating expenses and your own goals.”

The formula supports reducing energy consumption and emissions through efficiency gains such as transitioning to LEDs as much as possible before switching to renewable energy. Otherwise companies will be paying for extra renewable electricity capacity they may not need with lower energy requirements.

Said Elhattab: “We’ve seen from our supply chain customers that switching to LED lighting is often the first step of a decarbonization journey. Although switching to LED bulbs costs a slight upfront premium the technology and products are reliable the energy and cost savings are proven and the [return on investment] is clear.”

The company leased a new 141520-square-foot industrial building at 6300 N. Broadway in Adams County for the package-sorting facility a Target spokeswoman told BusinessDen.

Paulino Gardens a nursery and garden center operated at the Broadway site for about six decades before closing in 2019. The building that Target is leasing was developed by San Francisco-based Prologis which purchased the property that year from the Paulino family for $12.2 million records show.

Target said in a 2021 company blog post that 95 percent of its online orders are fulfilled at one of the company’s stores as opposed to a large warehouse like those used by Amazon.

The company’s sortation centers take the process of sorting those packages away from a store backroom. Target trucks pick up the orders from local stores and take them to the sortation center.

The company said in a July blog post that the setup saves store staff time lets Target more easily scale its employee count as online orders increase and allows the company to better consolidate orders and batch deliveries.

Target opened its first sortation center in its home city of Minneapolis in 2020. The company now has nine such facilities either open or planned.

The Adams County facility will open within the next year the Target spokeswoman said. It will be the company’s first in Colorado.

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department (USDOT) said on Wednesday a supply chain pilot data-sharing project aimed at easing bottlenecks at congested U.S. ports has begun exchanging data and doubled in size.

USDOT announced the planned project in March with truckers shippers wholesalers retailers and ports ""to develop a digital tool that gives companies information on the condition of a node or region in the supply chain.""

The effort known as the Freight Logistics Optimization Works (FLOW) program included 18 initial participants including FedEx UPS C.H Robinson Albertsons Target as well as the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles and ocean carriers CMA CGM and MSC and Fenix Marine Terminal and Global Container Terminals.

U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg called the program a ""first-of-its-kind initiative to share information and help move goods more quickly and cheaply.""

The White House said in March the goal was to create a ""proof of-of-concept freight information exchange by the end of the summer.""

The department is holding a meeting on Wednesday to discuss initial secure data sharing with USDOT of the group that has now expanded to 36 participants including logistics giant DHL part of Deutsche Post DHL Group long-haul trucker J.B. Hunt Maersk Samsung Procter & Gamble and Prologis to

USDOT said it is serving as ""an independent steward of supply chain data across a largely privately-operated enterprise that spans shipping lines ports terminal operators truckers railroads warehouses and beneficial cargo owners.""

Samsung Electronics North America CEO KS Choi said ""data sharing enabling timely cargo delivery is a work in progress but remains incomplete. Fixing this problem will require cooperation with many stakeholders across the supply chain.""

On Monday the National Retail Federation (NRF) said imports at major U.S. container ports are expected to slow significantly for the remainder of the year but 2022 should still see a net gain over 2021.

""Lower volumes may help ease congestion at some ports but others are still seeing backups and global supply chain challenges are far from over"" the NRF said.

She is also bringing her positive energy to Montclair as a mentor and a new member of the Montclair State University Black Alumni Advisory Council. Posted in: Alumni News and Events Alumni Profiles

The 200+ clients of West Orange New Jersey’s ASE Group receive much more than

year-end tax preparation. Al-Nesha Jones CPA ’07 ’13 MBA and her all-female team of

financial professionals educate and provide year-round expertise to help business

owners build their enterprises and their community.

“My firm’s clients work hard and have great ideas” Jones explains. “What they often

don’t have is good financial know-how. By educating and guiding our clients throughout

the year we empower them to grow their businesses.”

When Jones formed ASE Group in 2016 she brought considerable corporate

experience as an Associate Manager of Financial Reporting at Prudential Financial and as

an Assurance Senior at EY where she began her career as an intern from Montclair. The

pivot might have been prompted by the need for flexibility to raise her family but it also

reflected a personal sense of mission as well as what she observed as a real need in

her community.

“I had a successful career working for very large companies but I didn’t feel like I was

having an impact” she explains. “At the same time I had friends and neighbors who

were struggling to make their small businesses thrive. They knew they had to pay taxes

but didn’t know how to plan for them. They needed more comprehensive guidance. I

saw an opportunity to make a real contribution. I wanted to see them win.”

In addition to tax accounting and financial counseling services Jones educates the

community through free bookkeeping and tax classes and her Tea & Amp; Tax Talk Blog. She also teaches a Quickbooks Online Certification course at Essex County College.

When Jones jumped off the corporate ladder to start her own community-minded

company it was not the first time she looked at her options and decided to pivot. “First

of all I was planning to attend college out of state but when I was offered the Edward J.

Bloustein Scholarship to attend a New Jersey state college I began touring campuses. I

loved Montclair and liked the idea of staying close to home.”

“My dad worked in programming so I initially enrolled at Montclair as a computer

science major” Jones continues. “I knew very quickly that it wasn’t for me however so

I switched to business and accounting classes.”

Working full-time in retail and customer service meant taking classes early in the

morning in the evening and on weekends. The demanding schedule did not keep

Jones from immersing herself in campus life however. “I served as a peer leader and

helped with new student orientation” she says. “I loved meeting the new students and

made a lot of friends.”

Jones’ involvement in Montclair has continued – and grown – since graduation. She

understands the power of mentorship and regularly volunteers her time mentoring

students. “I received such wonderful mentorship from my professors and counselors

before I even knew it was mentorship” she says with a laugh. “They were always there

to give advice and answer questions. Recruiting events on campus introduced me to

people I would not have met otherwise and ultimately led to my first professional role. I

kept in touch with some of my professors over the years and later when I was starting

my own firm they continued to inspire and support me.”

When Jones was introduced to the Black Alumni Advisory Council at last year’s

homecoming she saw another opportunity to give back to her alma mater. “I remember

what it was like coming to Montclair as a first-generation college student” she says.

“Montclair is very diverse but it is also big! It can be a challenge for a new student to

figure out where they fit in.”

“There were so many people at Montclair who helped me create a path to success” she

adds. “They taught me how to pursue my own definition of success. I want to do the

same for others.”

For Jones this now includes looking to the Montclair campus when recruiting new team

members for the ASE Group. “I hired a paid intern from the University who is now an

employee” she says. “So much good has come out of my involvement with Montclair. It

energizes me.”

The 2022 recipient of the NJCPA Ovation Award – DEI Jones also participates in the

ProConnect Customer Council for Intuit Inc. and is a member of the Intuit Trainer/Writer

Network an elite worldwide group of professionals who teach other accountants how to use Intuit tools. She is an inaugural member of the CHIP Professionals Council an organization that bridges the gap between consumers of financial products and financial

professionals of color a member of the National Black Society of CPAs and the

National Association of Black Accountants and President of the nonprofit organization

Black-Owned Everything. In 2021 Jones was a CPA Practice Advisor 40 under 40

honoree.

Although her three children are more than a few years away from college Jones is

hoping they will consider following her footsteps to Montclair. “Montclair put me in such

a good position professionally” she says. “I met President Koppell recently and learned

about the new programs and majors being added. But as much as the University grows

you can still feel the strong sense of community here.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlZGNyb3NzLm9yZy9hYm91dC11cy9uZXdzLWFuZC1ldmVudHMvbmV3cy8yMDIyL3JlZC1jcm9zcy1yZXNwb25kcy10by1kZXZhc3RhdGluZy1mbG9vZGluZy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Two Weeks Later Red Crossers Caring for Kentucky Flood Victims,"Two weeks after tragic flooding upturned lives and destroyed hundreds of homes across Eastern Kentucky the American Red Cross is still there working around the clock with our partners to provide comfort and critical support to help those in need.

This is an incredibly challenging situation and we are working closely with local officials to make sure people have the help they need as they begin the long road to recovery. Some areas remain cut off due to damaged roads and bridges and Red Cross disaster workers are bringing food and relief supplies to people by boat. Preliminary damage reports indicate that nearly 1400 homes were either destroyed or suffered major damage.

RED CROSS RESPONSE Today some 400 trained Red Cross disaster workers are on the ground in Kentucky helping to provide a safe place to stay food to eat critical relief supplies and emotional support for those affected by this tragedy. Volunteers are also replacing prescription medications eyeglasses or critical medical equipment like canes and wheelchairs which were left behind in the rush to get to safety.

Wednesday night the Red Cross and our partners provided comfort and care for more than 430 residents in 13 shelters across Eastern Kentucky. Since the flooding hit the region the Red Cross and our partners have provided a total of nearly 6000 overnight stays for residents forced to leave their homes. More than a dozen Red Cross emergency response vehicles are circulating through the hardest hit communities with volunteers providing meals and cleanup supplies.

With the support of local partners the Red Cross has helped to provide some 81000 meals and snacks to people in need. In addition we’ve given out thousands of critical relief items to over 1400 households.

Red Cross care teams are meeting with families who have lost loved ones to offer specialized support including disaster mental health services and other information.

Frequently Asked Questions

What Is Life Insurance for Smokers?

Life insurance for smokers offers the same benefits as life insurance policies purchased by non-smokers with the main difference being that smokers typically pay a higher rate.

People buy life insurance to help protect their families from financial hardship by leaving them a non-taxable death benefit if they die. The beneficiaries can use the money to cover the mortgage on the family home repay personal loans put a child through college or cover final expenses. The life insurance payout could also replace your family’s income and allow them to maintain their quality of life when you're no longer there.

Generally speaking life insurance is offered either as a term or permanent policy also called whole life. Term insurance is coverage for a set length of time—10 years for example. Should you die during the term the insurance provider will pay your beneficiaries a death benefit. If you don’t die within the term you’ll need new coverage.

Permanent life insurance provides life-long coverage along with a cash value you can use if you need it.

How Do Life Insurance Companies Know You’re a Smoker?

Insurance companies need to form a complete picture of your health and ask you relevant questions such as whether you smoke or use nicotine products. It’s essential to answer these questions honestly and admit if you use tobacco even if only occasionally.

If the life insurance policy requires you to have a medical examination there are tests to find nicotine in your blood or urine. They’ll also search for cotinine which is a nicotine byproduct that can stay in your bloodstream for seven to 10 days or more.

Although being a person who smokes may result in higher rates for life insurance it’s never a good idea to hide your smoking habit on the application form. Even though some companies offer policies with no medical exam you should still reveal your smoking habit and eliminate any risk of your death benefit not being paid in the event you die from a smoking-related illness.



Does Life Insurance Cost More for Smokers?

Life insurance does cost more for people who smoke. Smoking kills nearly half a million people each year in the United States meaning that smoking has serious health consequences and impacts life expectancy. Insurance providers regard smokers as a higher risk than non-smokers a factor that is reflected in the cost of premiums.

Using quotes from Transamerica to illustrate the cost for a 40-year-old female smoker on a 20-year term Trendsetter Super policy for $500000 would be around $105 per month—or $130 for a man. If you quote for non-smokers with all other details the same the price is $25 a month for females and $30 for men. That’s an increase of 320% for women and 333% for men.

How Long After Quitting Do Life Insurance Companies Consider You a Non-Smoker?

The good news is that if you quit smoking many life insurance companies consider you a non-smoker if you have been smoke-free for 12 months. However because companies have their own rules about the definition of a non-smoker you should check with each provider to confirm.

Methodology

We evaluated 18 insurance companies offering life insurance policies to smokers before selecting the top four category leaders. We considered the cost of monthly premiums benefit amount and ease of applying and purchasing. Additionally we reviewed the company’s reputation and portfolio of offerings.

We also considered how straightforward it is to obtain a quote and if applicants need to undergo a physical medical exam as a requirement.

For customer Arlene Robin thanking the PSE&G employee who went out of his way to help her after she fell near her home was particularly important she said because there is so much negativity in the world today.

“He stayed by my side until he knew I was okay which is wonderful” Robin said of PSE&G Gas Construction Street Mechanic Jonathan Harmon. “They are doing their jobs working as hard as they can but I noticed that Jonathan always was very observant while working.”

Although he got his first aid kit bandaged her knee and took charge even though a local police officer also offered help Robin didn’t know at the time just how prepared Harmon was to offer his assistance.

First Harmon said just out of school in Wyoming he had a short stint as a social worker but he decided to switch careers because his empathy had him bringing too much of his social work home with him.

Second when he decided to work for PSE&G about 8 years ago his dad James Patrick Harmon a retired troubleshooter in PSE&G Electric Operations impressed upon him the need to help community members.

“He told me ‘It’s Public Service and you serve the public.’ Whenever you see somebody in need you need to respond. You’ll see a lot of situations that call you to act outside of your job classification.’ And he gave me examples of how he helped people out along his career.”

For Harmon stopping his work and racing to Robin’s assistance was just what anybody would do.

“I was just the first one to see her fall. I think she was more scared than anything else because she told me a few months earlier she fractured her knee” Harmon said. “We offered to call an ambulance but she said she just needed to rest. That’s when I ran to get the first aid kit out of my truck and cleaned out her cuts.”

Later that same day Robin emailed PSE&G to express her thanks. She followed up to make sure the act of heroism was noted by senior leaders.

“Jonathan was aware of his surroundings stopped his work and helped. Not everyone would have done that” Robin said. “It’s important to recognize employees who have gone far beyond regular duties.”

Harmon agreed that more people need to look out for each other and he said he is glad he works for a company where such acts are encouraged.

“We all have our jobs and need to come to work and do our best” Harmon said. “Sometimes in order to not only be a better worker but a better person you have to act and help somebody else out.”

Gas Construction Supervisor Eric Adams said he has a lot to be proud about when it comes to Harmon including the care he takes at work even in the midst of expecting his first child to be born.

“Jonathan always goes above and beyond and does whatever it takes to get the job done” Adams said. “Thank you Jonathan!”

To take one example there has been a fivefold growth in internet searches for ESG since 2019 even as searches for “CSR” (corporate social responsibility)—an earlier area of focus more reflective of corporate engagement than changes to a core business model—have declined. Across industries geographies and company sizes organizations have been allocating more resources toward improving ESG. More than 90 percent of S&P 500 companies now publish ESG reports in some form as do approximately 70 percent of Russell 1000 companies. In a number of jurisdictions reporting ESG elements is either mandatory or under active consideration. In the United States the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering new rules that would require more detailed disclosure of climate-related risks and greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. Additional SEC regulations on other facets of ESG have also been proposed or are pending.

The rising profile of ESG has also been plainly evident in investments even while the rate of new investments has recently been falling. Inflows into sustainable funds for example rose from $5 billion in 2018 to more than $50 billion in 2020—and then to nearly $70 billion in 2021; these funds gained $87 billion of net new money in the first quarter of 2022 followed by $33 billion in the second quarter. Midway through 2022 global sustainable assets are about $2.5 trillion. This represents a 13.3 percent fall from the end of Q1 2022 but is less than the 14.6 percent decline over the same period for the broader market.

A major part of ESG growth has been driven by the environmental component of ESG and responses to climate change. But other components of ESG in particular the social dimension have also been gaining prominence. One analysis found that social-related shareholder proposals rose 37 percent in the 2021 proxy season compared with the previous year.

In the wake of the war in Ukraine and the ensuing human tragedy as well as the cumulative geopolitical economic and societal effects critics have argued that the importance of ESG has peaked. Attention they contend will shift increasingly to the more foundational elements of a Maslow-type hierarchy of public- and private-sector needs and in the future today’s preoccupation with ESG may be remembered as merely a fad and go the way of similar acronyms that have been used in the past. Others have argued that ESG represents an odd and unstable combination of elements and that attention should be only focused on environmental sustainability. In parallel challenges to the integrity of ESG investing have been multiplying. While some of these arguments have also been directed to policy makers analysts and investment funds the analysis presented in this article (and in the accompanying piece “How to make ESG real”) is focused at the level of the individual company. In other words: Does ESG really matter to companies? What is the business-grounded strategic rationale?

A critical lens on ESG

Criticisms of ESG are not new. As ESG has gone mainstream and gained support and traction it has consistently encountered doubt and criticism as well. The main objections fall into four main categories.

1. ESG is not desirable because it is a distraction

Perhaps the most prominent objection to ESG has been that it gets in the way of what critics see as the substance of what businesses are supposed to do: “make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the society” as Milton Friedman phrased it more than a half-century ago.” Viewed in this perspective ESG can be presented as something of a sideshow—a public-relations move or even a means to cash in on the higher motives of customers investors or employees. ESG is something “good for the brand” but not foundational to company strategy. It is additive and occasional. ESG ratings and score provider MSCI for example found that nearly 60 percent of “say on climate” votes in 2021 were only one-time events; fewer than one in four of these votes were scheduled to have annual follow-ups. Other critics have cast ESG efforts as “greenwashing” “purpose washing” or “woke washing.” One Edelman survey for example reported that nearly three out of four institutional investors do not trust companies to achieve their stated sustainability ESG or diversity equity and inclusion (DEI) commitments.

2. ESG is not feasible because it is intrinsically too difficult

A second critique of ESG is that beyond meeting the technical requirements of each of the E S and G components striking the balance required to implement ESG in a way that resonates among multiple stakeholders is simply too hard. When solving for a financial return the objective is clear: to maximize value for the corporation and its shareholders. But what if the remit is broader and the feasible solutions vastly more complex? Solving for multiple stakeholders can be fraught with trade-offs and may even be impossible. To whom should a manager pay the incremental ESG dollar? To the customer by way of lower prices? To the employees through increased benefits or higher wages? To suppliers? Toward environmental issues perhaps by means of an internal carbon tax? An optimal choice is not always clear. And even if such a choice existed it is not certain that a company would have a clear mandate from its shareholders to make it.

3. ESG is not measurable at least to any practicable degree

A third objection is that ESG particularly as reflected in ESG scores cannot be accurately measured. While individual E S and G dimensions can be assessed if the required auditable data are captured some critics argue that aggregate ESG scores have little meaning. The deficiency is further compounded by differences of weighting and methodology across ESG ratings and scores providers. For example while credit scores of S&P and Moody’s correlated at 99 percent ESG scores across six of the most prominent ESG ratings and scores providers correlate on average by only 54 percent and range from 38 percent to 71 percent. Moreover organizations such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) can measure the same phenomena differently; for example GRI considers employee training in part by amounts invested in training while SASB measures by training hours. It is to be expected therefore that different ratings and scores providers—which incorporate their own analyses and weightings—would provide diverging scores. Moreover major investors often use their own proprietary methodologies that draw from a variety of inputs (including ESG scores) which these investors have honed over the years.

4. Even when ESG can be measured there is no meaningful relationship with financial performance

The fourth objection to ESG is that positive correlations with outperformance when they exist could be explained by other factors and in any event are not causative. It would indeed challenge reason if ESG ratings across ratings and scores providers measuring different industries using distinct methodologies weighting metrics differently and examining a range of companies that operate in various geographies all produced a near-identical score that almost perfectly matched company performance. Correlations with performance could be explained by multiple factors (for example industry headwinds or tailwinds) and are subject to change. Several studies have questioned any causal link between ESG performance and financial performance. While according to a recent metastudy the majority of ESG-focused investment funds do outperform the broader market some ESG funds do not and even those companies and funds that have outperformed could well have an alternative explanation for their outperformance. (For example technology and asset-light companies are often among broader market leaders in ESG ratings; because they have a relatively low carbon footprint they tend to merit higher ESG scores.) The director of one recent study proclaimed starkly: “There is no ESG alpha.”

In addition to these four objections recent events and roiled markets have led some to call into question the applicability of ESG ratings at this point. It is true that the recognized pressing need to strengthen energy security in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine may lead to more fossil-fuel extraction and usage in the immediate term and the global collaboration required for a more orderly net-zero transition may be jeopardized by the war and its aftermath. It is also likely that patience for what may be called “performative ESG” as opposed to what may be called true ESG will likely wear thin. True ESG is consistent with a judicious well-considered strategy that advances a company’s purpose and business model (exhibit).

Yet many companies today are making major decisions such as discontinuing operations in Russia protecting employees in at-risk countries organizing relief to an unprecedented degree and doing so in response to societal concerns. They also continue to commit to science-based targets and to define and execute plans for realizing these commitments. That indicates that ESG considerations are becoming more—not less—important in companies’ decision making.

Sustainable performance is not possible without social license

The fundamental issue that underlies each of the four ESG critiques is a failure to take adequate account of social license—that is the perception by stakeholders that a business or industry is acting in a way that is fair appropriate and deserving of trust. It has become dogma to state that businesses exist to create value in the long term. If a business does something to destroy value (for example misallocating resources on “virtue signaling” or trying to measure with precision what can only be imperfectly estimated at least to date through external scores) we would expect that criticisms of ESG could resonate particularly when one is applying a long-term value-creating lens.

But what some critics overlook is that a precondition for sustaining long-term value is to manage and address massive paradigm-shifting externalities. Companies can conduct their operations in a seemingly rational way aspire to deliver returns quarter to quarter and determine their strategy over a span of five or more years. But if they assume that the base case does not include externalities or the erosion of social license by failing to take externalities into account their forecasts—and indeed their core strategies—may not be achievable at all. Amid a thicket of metrics estimates targets and benchmarks managers can miss the very point of why they are measuring in the first place: to ensure that their business endures with societal support in a sustainable environmentally viable way.

ESG ratings: Does change matter? Among the most sharply debated questions about environmental social and governance (ESG) is the extent to which ESG as measured by ratings can offer meaningful insights about future financial or TSR performance—particularly when ratings and scores providers use different and sometimes mutually inconsistent methodologies. A number of studies find a positive relationship between ESG ratings and financial performance. Other research suggests that while scoring well in ESG does not destroy financial value the relationship between ESG ratings at any given time and value creation at the identical time can be tenuous or nonexistent. Because of the short time frame over which the topic has been studied and the resulting lack of robust analyses conclusions from the analyses should be tempered. In exploring the connection between ESG ratings and financial performance another approach is to look at the effect of a change in ESG ratings. This approach mitigates issues deriving from differences among various ESG rating methodologies (assuming the methodologies are relatively consistent over time). It stands to reason that demonstrating real improvement—if reflected in the scores—could in turn drive TSR outperformance for multiple reasons including those we explore in this article. Our initial research indicates however that it is too soon to tell. We found that on average companies that show an improvement in ESG ratings over multiyear time periods may exhibit higher shareholder returns compared with industry peers in the period after the improvement in ESG scores. We found too that the effect of this result has increased in recent years (exhibit). This initial finding is in line with some of the recent academic research and was also generally consistent across data from multiple ratings and scores providers. Still the findings are not yet conclusive. For example only 54 percent of the companies we categorize as “improvers” and less than one-half of those categorized as “slight improvers” demonstrated a positive excess TSR. The research also does not prove causation. It is important to bear in mind that ESG scores are still evolving observations in the aggregate may be less applicable to companies considered individually and exogenous factors such as headwinds and tailwinds in industries and individual companies cannot be fully controlled for. Most important this research does not explain the mechanism of TSR outperformance and whether the outperformance is sustainable. We know from decades of research that companies with a higher expected return on capital and growth are ultimately TSR outperformers and that there is clear statistically significant correlation. Are ESG ratings a sign of greater expected resilience of margins in the transition an indication of higher growth through green portfolios—or do they suggest something else? Will these increased expectations relative to peers ultimately materialize or will they revert to the mean? ESG ratings are very new compared with financial ratings and therefore it will take time for them to evolve. We will continue to research these questions as data sets increase and refinements to ESG scores continue to be refined. Regardless of current ratings scores many companies are already advancing in ESG to improve their long-term financial performance. High performers consider and seek to learn from ESG ratings but they do not get unduly distracted or make superficial changes merely to score higher. Companies should focus on ESG improvements that matter most to their business models even if the improvements do not directly translate to higher ratings. Since conclusions about the relationship between ESG ratings and financial performance are not yet certain they might not be compelling enough on their own to persuade executives to invest significant resources in ESG. But there is a tangible cost to waiting. In fact companies should adopt a bias toward focusing on ESG today; if companies particularly those with significant externalities (such as high-emitting industries) hold out for perfect data and a “flawless” rating process they may not have a business in 20 to 30 years.

Accordingly the responses to ESG critics coalesce on three critical points: the acute reality of externalities the early success of some organizations and the improvement of ESG measurements over time. And the case for ESG cannot be dismissed by connections between ESG scores and financial performance and changes in ESG scores over time. (For a discussion about ESG ratings and their relationship to financial performance see sidebar “ESG ratings: Does change matter?”)

1. Externalities are increasing

Company actions can have meaningful consequences for people who are not immediately involved with the company. Externalities such as a company’s GHG emissions effects on labor markets and consequences for supplier health and safety are becoming an urgent challenge in our interconnected world. Regulators clearly take notice. Even if some governments and their agencies demand changes more quickly and more forcefully than others multinational businesses in particular cannot afford to take a wait-and-see approach. To the contrary their stakeholders expect them to take part now in how the regulatory landscape and broader societal domain will likely evolve. More than 5000 businesses for example have made net-zero commitments as part of the United Nations’ “Race to Zero” campaign. Workers are also increasingly prioritizing factors such as belonging and inclusion as they choose whether to remain with their company or join a competing employer. Many companies in turn are moving aggressively to reallocate resources and operate differently; nearly all are feeling intense pressure to change. Even before the Ukraine war induced dramatic company action the pandemic had prompted companies to reconsider and change core business operations. Many have embarked on a similar path with respect to climate change. This pressure visceral and tangible is an expression of social license—and it has been made more pressing as rising externalities have become more urgent.

2. Some companies have performed remarkably showing that ESG success is indeed possible

Social license is not static and companies do not earn the continued trust of consumers employees suppliers regulators and other stakeholders based merely upon prior actions. Indeed earning social capital is analogous to earning debt or equity capital—those who extend it look to past results for insights about present performance and are most concerned with intermediate and longer-term prospects. Yet unlike traditional sources of capital where there are often creative financing alternatives there are ultimately no alternatives for companies that do not meet the societal bar and no prospect of business as usual or business by workaround under conditions of catastrophic climate change.

Because ESG efforts are a journey bumps along the way are to be expected. No company is perfect. Key trends can be overlooked errors can be made rogue behaviors can manifest themselves and actions can have unintended consequences. But since social license is corporate “oxygen”—thus impossible to survive without it—companies cannot just wait and hope that things will all work out. Instead they need to get ahead of future issues and events by building purpose into their business models and demonstrating that they benefit multiple stakeholders and the broader public. Every firm has an implicit purpose—a unique raison d’être that answers the question “What would the world lose if this company disappeared?” Companies that embed purpose in their business model not only mitigate risk; they can also create value from their values. For example Patagonia a US outdoor-equipment and clothing retailer has always been purpose driven—and announced boldly that it is “in business to save our home planet.” Natura &Co a Brazil-based cosmetics and personal-care company in business to “promote the harmonious relationship of the individual with oneself with others and with nature” directs its ESG efforts to initiatives such as protecting the Amazon defending human rights and embracing circularity. Multiple other companies across geographies and industries are using ESG to achieve societal impact and ancillary financial benefits as well.

3. Measurements can be improved over time

While ESG measurements are still a work in progress it is important to note that there have been advancements. ESG measurements will be further improved over time. They are already changing; there is a trend toward consolidation of ESG reporting and disclosure frameworks (though further consolidation is not inevitable). Private ratings and scores providers such as MSCI Refinitiv S&P Global and Sustainalytics for their part are competing to provide insightful standardized measures of ESG performance.

There is also a trend toward more active regulation with increasingly granular requirements. Despite the differences in assessing ESG the push longitudinally has been for more accurate and robust disclosure not fewer data points or less specificity. It is worth bearing in mind too that financial accounting arose from stakeholder pull not from spontaneous regulatory push and did not materialize fully formed along the principles and formats that we see today. Rather reporting has been the product of a long evolution—and a sometimes sharp debate. It continues to evolve—and in the case of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) reporting continues to have differences. Those differences reflecting how important these matters are to stakeholders do not negate the case for rigorous reporting—if anything they strengthen it.

While the acronym ESG as a construct may have lost some of its luster its underlying proposition remains essential at the level of principle. Names will come and go (ESG itself arose after CSR corporate engagement and similar terms) and these undertakings are by nature difficult and can mature only after many iterations. But we believe that the importance of the underlying ideas has not peaked; indeed the imperative for companies to earn their social license appears to be rising. Companies must approach externalities as a core strategic challenge not only to help future-proof their organizations but to deliver meaningful impact over the long term.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL3BlcmF0b24tdG8tc2VydmUtYXMtZGVmZW5zZS1oZWFsdGgtYWdlbmN5cy1lbnRlcnByaXNlLWluZm9ybWF0aW9uLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktc2VydmljZXMtaW50ZWdyYXRvci0zMDE2MDI5ODYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Peraton to Serve as Defense Health Agency's Enterprise Information Technology Services Integrator,"Under $2B EITSI contract the company will support the DHA's IT transformation to consolidate services and reduce costs

Other types of hand tools may be added later.

Milwaukee Tool owned by Hong-Kong based Techtronic Industries is attempting for the first time to make hand tools in the U.S. That goes against a general tool industry trend of more production in other countries.

The change pleases Ted Galbraith who is the lead forge operator at the West Bend plant. ""It's great to see some things come back from overseas see stuff made in the USA. I've worked at

at other manufacturing plants where they were losing a lot of their work to overseas stuff. So it's nice to see things come back this way"" Galbraith tells WUWM.

So just how is Milwaukee Tool going to make a buck making hand tools in Wisconsin?

Company official Tim Albrecht spoke at a ribbon-cutting ceremony in West Bend Wednesday. He said for now the tools will be marketed to tradespeople such as plumbers power utility workers electricians and those working with heating and cooling systems.

Albrecht said in recent years Milwaukee Tool has spent a lot of time talking to those customer groups. ""And realizing that they had to modify the hand tools that they had. They were welding extra parts on their hand tools. They were scoring the heads of the hand tools to ream pipe for example"" he explained.

Chuck Quirmbach Milwaukee Tool executive Steve Richman speaks during Wednesday's event.

Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers praised the opening of the tool plant and said the state is assisting the company's continued expansion — $22 million in Enterprise Zone tax credits were given to Milwaukee Tool this year making the state's total help for the firm more than $70 million.

Group President Steve Richman acknowledged the help from the public sector but he said the company now has more than 3700 workers in Wisconsin and has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in capital projects.

""We have consistently over-delivered in every place we have built a manufacturing plant an office facility or anything else"" Richman told WUWM.

Richman said he's very optimistic about future growth yet at the same time describes the firm as a ""paranoid group.""

He explained ""We know that if we don't disrupt and change the game and provide the solutions to our users then they're going to want some other product from somebody else that's gonna deliver better solutions. And that paranoia keeps our teams working hard.""

More design and engineering work at Milwaukee Tool is about to take place at a refurbished office complex in downtown Milwaukee. But Richman said construction delays will prevent full use of the building until the first quarter of next year.

LAKE MARY Fla. (August 11 2022) - San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E) a regulated investor-owned utility providing energy service to 3.7 million people ordered Mitsubishi Power’s Emerald storage solutions for four utility-scale battery energy storage system (BESS) projects totaling 39 megawatts (MW) / 180 megawatt hours (MWh). The Elliot Clairemont Paradise and Boulevard microgrid BESS projects will connect to existing infrastructure in the San Diego region to provide reliable capacity and strengthen grid resiliency amid high energy demands on hot summer days and peak evening hours.

The Emerald storage solutions include the Emerald Integrated Plant Controller which is an Energy Management System (EMS) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system with real-time BESS operation and a monitoring/supervisory control platform. These control features will help ensure that critical public service facilities including fire medical emergency management and police are powered during peak demand and unexpected outages.

“We live in a time when growing threats from climate change and extreme heat waves can increasingly impact grid reliability” said SDG&E Director of Advanced Clean Technology Fernando Valero. “By expanding our energy storage portfolio we are helping our region and critical community facilities become more resilient.""

The microgrid BESS projects approved by the California Public Utilities Commission on June 23 are slated to be online in mid-2023.

Tom Cornell Senior Vice President Energy Storage Solutions Mitsubishi Power Americas said “SDG&E was an early adopter of battery energy storage in the western United States and it continues to be a leader in deploying energy storage to serve its customers. We’re excited to make an impact with SDG&E on these four microgrid projects in addition to the Pala-Gomez Creek energy storage project announced earlier this year.”

To ensure power to critical community services San Diego Gas & Electric is adding Mitsubishi Power’s Emerald storage solutions. Four microgrid projects totaling 39 megawatts /180 megawatt hours will strengthen grid resiliency and add reliable capacity to the region’s infrastructure for peak demand and unexpected power outages.

In May 2022 Mitsubishi Power was awarded cybersecurity certification IEC 62443 ML2 for the Security Development Lifecycle Process (SDL) which validates that all products developed for its Emerald storage solutions including hardware control technology follow rigorous policy and processes aligned to industry best practices.

Mitsubishi Power will support its Emerald storage solutions for SDG&E with a 10-year Long-Term Service Agreement.

“Completion of the variance approval process is a major milestone for the development of the Parker Project and is the result of some excellent work by the Revolve development team working closely with the BLM over the last 10 months” said Steve Dalton CEO of Revolve.

At the end of 2021 the BLM started solicitating interest for utility-scale solar projects on nearly 90000 acres of public land located across Colorado Nevada and New Mexico.

At the time it had said it had allocated roughly 870000 acres of federal public land as environmentally preferrable for solar leasing based on the areas’ high potential for solar energy and suitability for utility-scale solar plants.

Just last month it issued final approval for the construction of a 500MW solar project in the desert of south-eastern California.

A Cushman & Wakefield (CWK) report on more than 10000 self-storage facilities shared exclusively with Commercial Observer found that average asking rents for self-storage facilities in the second quarter stood at $1.35 per square foot for unheated units and $1.47 per square foot for climate-controlled units. Meanwhile rental income increased 18.5 percent year-over-year.

However demand may be slowing at self-storage buildings which went from a niche asset class to a highly lucrative sector during the pandemic. Occupancy in the second quarter dropped by 1 percent compared to the same period last year and landlords ponied up more cash on deals to attract customers.

Facilities spent 26.4 percent more in the second quarter on concessions — such as a month of free rent or deeply discounted move-in fees — compared to the same period last year. And 3.7 percent more self-storage properties decided to offer concessions in the second quarter compared to those doing so a year prior.

Demand could drop further in the next year as a growing crop of self-storage properties in the U.S. particularly in New York begins to take shape. New construction starts ticked up 14 percent from the first quarter and 1 percent year-over-year. The area that includes New York City Newark and Edison N.J. had the highest number of projects in the pipeline and the most expensive rent in the second quarter according to the report. Asking rent in those locations averaged $2 per square foot in the second quarter a 2 percent increase year-over-year.

The self-storage sector had an incredible rise after COVID-19 forced remote workers to clear space for home offices and pushed college students out of their dorms. Manhattan alone saw $3 billion worth of self-storage facilities sold last year more than six times the value of the borough’s transactions in 2020 and the busiest year on record as other commercial real estate properties’ values shrunk.

Even as the sector faces headwinds from construction and unmoving occupancy self-storage deals in New York have raked in millions in the first half of 2022. Just last month The Carlyle Group picked up a 180000-square-foot self-storage retail condo in Long Island City Queens for $80 million. In March Storage Post Self Storage nabbed a Bronx facility for $64 million and bought another Staten Island asset for $51 million according to property records.

The DoJ claims this was despite the fledgling company's supposedly proprietary tech having been developed by Qualcomm staff and allegedly aided by inside access to Qualcomm.

The indictment claims that Qualcomm's now ex-vice president of research and development Karim Arabi created new microchip technology unbeknownst to his then main employer in 2015. Meanwhile it goes on to allege another former Qualcomm vice president Akbar Shokouhi helped fund and support the development of a resultant business Abreezio LLC via three different entities he controlled.

Under Arabi's contract the indictment says ""he was bound by agreements generally providing that intellectual property he created during his period of employment would belong to"" his employer Qualcomm.

The intellectual property Abreezio is said to have developed includes ""IP and EDA tools focused on PPA optimization in advanced technology nodes"" according to the Linkedin bio of a company exec.

The indictment alleges that some Qualcomm VPs along with Abreezio's appointed CEO Sanjiv Taneja obscured Arabi's role in developing the tech due to provisions in his contract that stated inventions made during employment belonged to Qualcomm.

Instead the group marketed the invention as being the brainchild of a Canadian graduate student Sheida Alan and the company as an angel-funded Silicon Valley-based design IP startup.

The Canadian-grad-student-Angel-investor narrative was marketed to Qualcomm to entice them to purchase Abreezio the DoJ claims.

But according to the indictment unsealed on 9 August Alan was Arabi's ""younger sister.""

Court documents allege Arabi was the one who filed the provisional patents under Alan's name and was secretly involved in most Abreezio matters even choosing the company name.

The crew sought to hide his involvement using sham email accounts and even having Arabi impersonate his sister the indictment alleges.

Meanwhile the company relied on Arabi to provide intel on Qualcomm allege prosecutors. Court documents allege Teneja asked Arabi for insight on comparable technology to better market Abreezio.

In October 2015 Abreezio was acquired by Qualcomm for $150 million with Qualcomm under the assumption all parties involved with the technology had been disclosed. The DoJ says Alan received almost $92 million Taneja took over $10 million and two of Shokouhi's entities received $24 million.

According to the indictment the defendants laundered the money through foreign real estate and interest-free loans.

On Tuesday August 9 charges were unsealed against Alan Arabi Taneja and Shokouhi. All but Alan were arrested. Alan awaits extradition proceedings from Canada. A superseding indictment [PDF] charges the lot with fraud and money laundering offenses.

Shokouhi pled not guilty later that day. The pleas of the other defendants have not yet been registered.

The defendants face up to 20 years in jail and fines of $250000 or twice the pecuniary gain/loss for the fraud charges or $500000 for the money laundering charges. They also must forfeit property derived from the fraud.

The Register has asked Qualcomm for its response and will update accordingly. ®

OPPO Watch 3 is now official in China.

The smartwatch is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon W5 platform.

OPPO is introducing two variants: a standard model and a Pro version for the first time.

OPPO isn't known for its wearables but the Chinese manufacturer has started paying attention to this category in the last two years. The first-gen OPPO Watch was a standout offering and it was one of the best budget Wear OS smartwatches available.

For 2022 OPPO is introducing the Watch 3 series. There are two models the Watch 3 and the Watch 3 Pro. Both smartwatches have a premium design and are made out of aluminum and are sold with either fluororubber or leather bands.

The standard Watch 3 has a 1.75-inch AMOLED screen with a 3D glass layer and the rectangular design looks rather striking. It has a 400mAh battery and is touted to last up to four days with daily use — if the real-world numbers are anywhere close to that figure it will be among the best Android smartwatches by default. The Galaxy Watch 4 doesn't last more than two days with medium use so this is a notable achievement.

(Image credit: OPPO)

The reason for this is down to the fact that both models are powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon W5 platform. OPPO initially stated that they were powered by the Snapdragon Wear 5100 but has clarified that it is the W5. The 4nm design is designed to deliver 2x better efficiency for the same workloads and that ties in with the stellar battery figures quoted by OPPO.

As for the Watch 3 Pro it has a large 1.91-inch AMOLED screen and interestingly it gets LTPO tech allowing the smartwatch to dynamically change the refresh. It also has a 3D curved glass layer and a 500mAh battery with a touted five-day battery life. Both smartwatches get fast charging — this is OPPO after all — with a 10-minute charge delivering usage of up to 24 hours and a full charge taking 60 minutes.

Both models have the same suite of sensors including a heart rate sensor pulse oximeter and in a first for the manufacturer ECG. You also get eSIM connectivity built-in GPS and both devices come with 5ATM water resistance as standard. On the storage side there's 32GB of internal storage and 1GB of RAM on both smartwatches.

Because the launch is limited to China at the moment the OPPO Watch 3 comes with ColorOS Watch 5.0. There's no telling if the smartwatches will run Wear OS when they launch globally or if they'll even make their way outside China. OPPO has confirmed that there isn't a plan to launch these smartwatches globally for now so like last year's model they're limited to the Chinese market. I'll share further details should that change.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9Nb3Rvcm9sYS1Nb3RvLVRhYi1HNjItbGF1bmNoLWRhdGUtY29uZmlybWVkLXdpdGgtYS1RdWFsY29tbS1TbmFwZHJhZ29uLTY4MC1MVEUtYW5kLTJLLWRpc3BsYXkuNjM5ODcwLjAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Motorola Moto Tab G62 launch date confirmed with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 680 LTE and 2K display,"Motorola is on the verge of launching a new tablet seemingly a mid-range option. Already confirmed as the Moto Tab G62 the tablet will rely on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 680 which will power a 10.6-inch and 2K display as well as providing LTE connectivity. The Moto Tab G62 should achieve decent runtimes too thanks to its 7700 mAh battery.

Flipkart has started teasing the Moto Tab G62 a tablet that looks an awful lot like the Moto Tab G70. According to the retailer the Moto Tab G62 features a 10.6-inch IPS display that operates at 2K. Presumably the tablet will offer a resolution of 2000 x 1200 pixels which would match the Moto Tab G70. Supposedly the display is also TÜV Rheinland Low Blue Light certified and supports stylus input.

Additionally the Moto Tab G62 relies on the Snapdragon 680 a mid-range chipset with an Adreno 610 GPU and an LTE modem. Seemingly Motorola will only offer the Moto Tab G62 with 4 GB of LPDDR4X RAM and 128 GB of expandable storage. However Flipkart has confirmed that Motorola will sell LTE and non-LTE variants with the latter being a cheaper option than the former. Meanwhile a 7700 mAh battery lies at the heart of the tablet which the tablet can recharge at up to 20 W."

The study funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) found that biomarkers present in the blood on the day of a TBI can accurately predict a patient's risk of death or severe disability six months later.

Although additional studies are needed to reproduce the results the findings indicate that blood-based biomarkers may help clinicians and researchers better predict patient outcomes after TBI the NIH said in a statement.

The study also concluded that elevated levels of two proteins help predict how a person will recover from a TBI providing important information to determine appropriate care according to Abbott the maker of the two tests used by researchers to detect the biomarkers.

Researchers conducting the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI (TRACK-TBI) study examined levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) -- proteins found in glial cells and neurons respectively -- in nearly 1700 patients with TBI.

They used two Abbott concussion tests: its i-Stat TBI Plasma test a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-cleared rapid test that runs on a portable analyzer and the firm's core laboratory Architect instrument.

GFAP and UCH-1 are currently used to aid in the detection of TBI. Elevated levels in the blood on the day of the TBI are linked to brain injury visible with neuroimaging.

The i-Stat TBI Plasma test is indicated for the measurement of levels of biomarkers associated with brain injury in the bloodstream to assist in determining the need for a CT scan of the head. The test is used to help evaluate mild TBI and is only available for use on the firm's i-Stat Alinity instrument a portable blood analyzer.

TRACK-TBI is an observational study aimed at improving understanding and diagnosis of TBIs to develop successful treatments.

The study team measured the biomarkers in blood samples taken from patients with TBI on the day of their injury and then evaluated their recovery six months later. Participants were recruited from 18 high-level trauma centers across the U.S.; more than half had suffered TBI as the result of a road traffic accident.

The study showed that GFAP and UCH-L1 levels on the day of injury were strong predictors of death and unfavorable outcomes such as vegetative state or severe disability requiring daily assistance to function NIH said in a statement adding that individuals with biomarker levels among the highest fifth were at greatest risk of death in the six months post-TBI with most occurring within the first month.

The new study suggests that GFAP and UCH-L1 levels may also help in predicting recovery particularly among patients with moderate to severe TBI and the biomarkers improved the accuracy of current prognostic models the NIH said.

The researchers found that the predictive value of the biomarkers was strongest for patients with moderate to severe TBI. However the biomarkers did not accurately predict who would experience incomplete recovery -- moderate disability but able to live independently -- at six months the NIH added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vbGVvbi5mbG9yaWRhaGVhbHRoLmdvdi9uZXdzcm9vbS8yMDIyLzA4L25hdGlvbmFsaGVhbHRoY2VudGVyd2Vlay1hcnRpY2xlLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,National Health Center Week | Florida Department of Health in Leon,"DOH Leon Observes National Health Center Week

Florida Department of Health in Leon County Observes National Health Center Week

Local Community Health Centers Offer Free Services in Observance of NHCW

Tallahassee Fla.--- National Health Center Week (NHCW) is an annual celebration to raise awareness about the mission and accomplishments of America's health centers over the past five decades. The Florida Department of Health in Leon County recognizes the dedicated community health center staff board members and patients and their vital role in shaping the past present and future of Leon County’s health care system.

This year National Health Center Week is August 7 – 13 2021 with the theme of “Community Health Centers: The Chemistry for Strong Communities.”

Community health centers serve as the beacon of strength service and care in their communities. In moments of pain and loss they offer support and love. In moments of triumph they offer hope and a vision for the future. For over 50 years community health centers have provided high-quality affordable comprehensive primary and preventive health care.

Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) also known as community health centers are non-profit community-directed providers that remove common barriers to care by serving communities who confront financial geographic language and cultural barriers. For over 50 years health centers have worked to build community-focused systems of care that address physical dental behavioral health and pharmacy needs as well as the social drivers that impact overall health.

Here in Leon County we are proud to partner with two FQHCs: Bond Community Health Center and Neighborhood Health Center in Tallahassee.

Health centers improve patient outcomes and are located in areas of higher need often where there is elevated poverty higher than average infant mortality and where few physicians practice. They may offer comprehensive services based on needs such as medical dental vision behavioral health and pharmacy as well as assisting patients access care with transportation and translation. Centers are open to all persons regardless of location age gender sexual orientation race insurance status or ability to pay. They offer sliding fee scale options to low-income patients.

The following events are scheduled to celebrate National Health Center Week in Leon County:

DOH Leon strongly supports our Community Health Centers because we know they are not ordinary medical clinics; they are also problem-solvers who reach beyond the exam room to care for the whole person by providing access to necessities like food and housing resources. Community Health Centers care for and welcome everyone. The Department proudly celebrates the vital role these health centers play in safeguarding the well-being of all our residents and honor the heroic staff who keep these facilities running.

Findings from a new study led by UMass Chan Medical School researchers are the basis for a safety communication issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Aug. 11 regarding serial use of at-home antigen tests for COVID-19.

The study results show that at-home antigen tests are more likely to detect COVID-19 within the first week of infection when a person without symptoms tests three times at 48-hour intervals and a person with symptoms tests twice according to the study by UMass Chan researchers and partners supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) Tech program. The research appeared in medRxiv a preprint online platform and has not yet been peer reviewed.

This study is a culmination of close collaboration with the FDA and NIH. The UMass Chan team has been working for the past year to ensure that the best evidence was generated for performance of rapid antigen tests in asymptomatic people according to Apurv Soni MD PhD’21 assistant professor of medicine and principal investigator on the study.

The FDA’s safety communication recommends people perform repeat or serial testing following a negative result on any at-home COVID-19 antigen test. If repeat testing is not performed after a negative result an infection may be missed and people may unknowingly spread the SARS-CoV-2 virus to others especially if they are not experiencing symptoms. The FDA recommends repeat testing following a negative result whether or not a person has COVID-19 symptoms.

“To our knowledge this is one of the largest studies to date that examined COVID-19 rapid antigen test performance serially over two weeks. The results of this study show that rapid tests detect the omicron as well as delta variants and that serial testing with antigen tests remains a useful way to detect infection” said co-author Nathaniel Hafer PhD assistant professor of molecular medicine and lead investigator of the RADx Tech Clinical Studies Core Logistics Team.

The study analysis looked at 5609 eligible people over age 2 across the country from among 7361 who were enrolled in the national Test Us At Home study conducted by the RADx Tech Clinical Studies Core between October 2021 and January 2022. Participants took an at-home antigen test using one of three retail test kits which are available in the United States and collected a sample for a molecular PCR test using nasal swabs for both types of test samples. They tested themselves every 48 hours for 15 days.

During the test period 154 participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection based on molecular PCR assays.

Serial testing with an at-home antigen test twice over 48 hours resulted in detection of more than 90 percent of infections when symptomatic people started testing within the first week of infection the study reports.

Among those who did not have symptoms but had an infection lasting at least two days based on PCR testing serial testing three times with an at-home antigen test at 48-hour intervals detected more than 75 percent of infections an increase from roughly 60 percent sensitivity after testing just twice.

An implication of findings from this study is that people who are suspected to be infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus but have not developed symptoms should exercise caution such as wearing masks and avoiding crowded places for at least six days until three at-home antigen tests taken 48 hours apart have been performed according to the study’s authors.

Dr. Hafer added that this large-scale study was made possible by its novel app-based digital enrollment and reporting features developed by the UMass Chan Program in Digital Medicine which is a much more streamlined method compared with traditional interventions in clinical trials. “This study demonstrates that it’s possible to rapidly enroll and conduct clinical research with digital techniques” he said. “We feel that our participants had a pretty seamless experience. However this was the result of a tremendous amount of work and coordination by our study team and our partners such as Quest Diagnostics CareEvolution community health centers and rapid test manufacturers.”

The research was funded by the NIH RADx Tech program administered by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering.

Or take a medication for multiple sclerosis (MS) that fits your symptoms preferences and lifestyle?

In the not-so-distant future these seemingly far-fetched innovations could actually be a reality. And Johnson & Johnson is hard at work on them and other solutions aimed at tackling neurodegenerative diseases—because there’s no time to waste.

Neurodegenerative diseases affect millions worldwide. Fifty-five million people around the world are living with dementia and an estimated 60-70% of those people have Alzheimer’s disease. And globally 2.8 million live with MS. As people age the likelihood of being diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disease only increases. These conditions in which nerve cells in the brain and nervous system become damaged and sometimes die currently have no cure.

For more than three decades Johnson & Johnson has made it its mission to understand these devastating disorders working to find ways to identify these diseases early stop them from progressing and potentially even find cures.

“We have a strong legacy in this area” says Bill Martin Ph.D. Global Therapeutic Area Head Neuroscience at Janssen Research & Development part of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson. For example the company has spent more than 30 years investigating the course of Alzheimer’s disease as well as studying different therapeutic interventions. “We’re entering a new era of precision neuroscience” Martin explains. “Our goal is to be able to identify the mechanisms of each different neurodegenerative disease so that we can come up with innovative approaches that not only treat symptoms and delay progression but reverse the course of the condition entirely.”

For Alzheimer’s Awareness Month here’s a look at three different disease areas where Johnson & Johnson is making major strides.

Creating High-Efficacy Treatments for Multiple Sclerosis

Gary S. Chapman/Photo ©Copyright Gary S. Chapman 2016

Numbness tingling mood changes memory problems pain fatigue vision disturbances and even paralysis are all symptoms of MS a disease that affects almost 3 million people globally the vast majority of them facing the diagnosis at the peak of their active lives both professionally and personally. While its exact cause is unknown MS occurs when the immune system goes into overdrive and attacks the brain and spinal cord. This damages myelin the protective layer that insulates nerve fibers and as a result can cause a host of challenging symptoms.

Over the last decade medications have become available that help control the symptoms—including one from from Johnson & Johnson which was granted approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last year to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis.

There may be people who tend to forget to take medication or have trouble swallowing pills or maybe prefer not to have to think about MS every day who would be better served with an infrequent infusion therapy. And then there are people with MS who prefer to take an active approach to MS do something to fight it every day and be able to feel in control of both the disease and the treatment with a high-efficacy easy-to-manage drug. Tatiana Sidorenko M.D. Ph.D.

Researchers at Johnson & Johnson will continue to study MS in new clinical trials which are expected to begin soon. In addition to seeking to find out if the drug works as well in children as in adults at least one of these studies is expected to provide the MS community with new data on a very common and disturbing “invisible” MS symptom—MS fatigue—and how different therapies impact it.

Moving forward Johnson & Johnson is committed to providing patients and healthcare providers with new treatment options for MS since no two patients are exactly alike and no MS drug is a one-size-fits-all solution.

“There may be people who tend to forget to take medication or have trouble swallowing pills or maybe prefer not to have to think about MS every day who would be better served with an infrequent infusion therapy” explains Tatiana Sidorenko M.D. Ph.D. Clinical Leader at Janssen Research & Development. “And then there are people with MS who prefer to take an active approach to MS do something to fight it every day and be able to feel in control of both the disease and the treatment with a high-efficacy easy-to-manage drug.”

Vanquishing Rare Autoantibody-Driven Diseases

It can be difficult to research rare diseases which are defined in the U.S. as those that affect fewer than 200000 people.

This is indeed true in the case of disorders such as myasthenia gravis (MG) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Both are autoantibody diseases which means that antibodies—normally substances that help protect the body against viruses and bacteria—view a person’s own tissues as invaders and attack them. If you have MG this can lead to muscle weakness that can cause problems with vision and make it hard to swallow breathe and even move your limbs. If you have CIDP your body attacks the myelin sheaths that cover your nerves leading to arm and leg tingling and progressing to weakness.

“Despite the availability of therapies there is still significant unmet need” says Hong Sun M.D. Ph.D. Senior Director Global Compound Development Team Leader Neuroscience at Janssen Research & Development. “Current treatments have slowed the onset of effects but are associated with significant side effects.”

That’s why Johnson & Johnson is hoping to make advances in the treatment of both conditions by studying the effects of potential treatments on autoantibodies that cause these diseases and trigger symptoms explains Dr. Sun. These studies are currently ongoing to evaluate the safety and efficacy of potential treatments.

“The mechanism of CIDP isn’t well understood and scientific evidence indicates autoantibodies may play a critical role. We are researching whether a therapeutic antibody agent will work in CIDP” explains Dr. Sun. Phase 3 trials in 300 patients are expected to begin this year. “Right now the standard of care is either steroids which suppress the immune system or intravenous immunoglobulin therapy which involves traveling to your doctor’s office every three to four weeks for several hours of infusion treatment” says Dr. Sun.

The company is conducting studies in more than 10 autoantibody associated diseases too such as warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia in which the body destroys its own red blood cells or hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn a rare disorder in which the blood types of a mom and her baby are incompatible. “We really see this as a potential path to open the door to treatments for more than 70 autoantibody diseases” says Dr. Sun.

Aiming to Treat Alzheimer’s Disease With Precision Medicine

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) spreads quietly long before people have any idea that they’re affected.

“Changes happen in patients’ brains decades before they show up at the doctor’s office with symptoms of cognitive decline” explains Fiona Elwood Ph.D. VP Disease Area Stronghold Leader Neurodegeneration at Janssen Research & Development. “We want to target the disease as early as possible so that we can preserve as much of the patient’s brain as possible including their memory and ability to remain independent.”

That’s why Johnson & Johnson is collaborating with AC Immune a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company to develop a potential treatment that spurs the body’s immune system to produce its own antibodies to attack pTau a type of protein that accumulates inside neurons in the brain and is thought to accelerate AD. “This protein accumulates years before the onset of clinical symptoms” says Elwood.

This is one of two programs Johnson & Johnson has targeting pTau. “The idea behind this treatment is to hopefully neutralize the protein so that it’s no longer able to spread from one cell to another” says Martin. “As a result we can hope to slow all disease progression or even prevent it entirely.”

Ultimately the goal is that people could be tested for neurodegenerative diseases on a regular basis the way doctors now check cholesterol and blood glucose levels as part of an annual physical to help prevent conditions such as heart disease or type 2 diabetes. Fiona Elwood Ph.D. VP

And while larger studies are ongoing Johnson & Johnson is also trying to identify biomarkers that could clue doctors in to who may benefit from this treatment.

“We’ve collaborated with organizations around the world to figure out which biological changes indicate very early-stage disease” says Elwood. The hope is that eventually a simple blood test will be enough to determine who may require more advanced imaging such as a brain scan to look for signs of Alzheimer’s and to see who might best benefit from this treatment. “It’s really a precision medicine approach” she says.

Ultimately says Elwood the goal is that people could be tested for neurodegenerative diseases on a regular basis the way doctors now check cholesterol and blood glucose levels as part of an annual physical to help prevent conditions such as heart disease or type 2 diabetes. “We want to give people their healthiest life possible in their old age and that includes their brain health as well” says Elwood.

Research like this takes years if not decades to fully develop. But Johnson & Johnson is willing to go the distance.

“We want to create a future where neurodegenerative diseases are a thing of the past” says Martin. “Our hope is that we can use our findings to develop first-in-class treatments that address the unmet needs of patients living with these conditions whether it’s to treat symptoms reverse the course of disease or just make it easier for them to access the medications they need.”

Quarterback Daniel Jones has not looked great so far during training camp but has some room for improvement under head coach Brian Daboll. The pressure is also on running back Saquon Barkley as the Giants just picked up his fifth year option and he will be making around $7.3 million this season. He claims he is fully healthy and is playing for a big contract this season. Realistically I see the Giants getting around six or seven wins which will be an improvement from their four win season in 2021. Here is my quick take on this from The Times Union:

It’s not been a great start for quarterback Daniel Jones at Giants training camp. Jones has not looked like the quarterback the Giants need him to be this season. It’s only training camp and Jones is on his 3rd head coach in four seasons but the passing game has struggled more times than not. Veteran backup Tyrod Taylor has been more impressive in camp and with Taylor at least the Giants have a strong number two if Jones fails to produce.

How does the ultimate all-American brand cause a sensation in Italy? The answer is impeccably in the case of Ralph Lauren which celebrated its Milan Design Week debut this past June. Over the course of Salone del Mobile the company welcomed industry insiders and assorted VIPs into its local headquarters a 1941 rationalist palazzo designed by noted architect Mino Fiocchi. Guests stepped beyond the edifice’s marble façade to discover a fully realized world: rooms out-fitted with Ralph Lauren Home’s fall 2022 offerings the courtyard transformed into a temporary Ralph’s dining space. Cappuccinos gave way to aperitivos as admirers immersed themselves morning to night. The starting point of the new collection—named Palazzo after the company’s digs—was Milan itself with expert know-how at the core of each design. “I have long been inspired by the romance and timeless beauty of Milan—its winding cobblestone streets the patina of its ancient façades and its rich heritage of artisanal craftsmanship” says the fashion legend. “When we discovered our palazzo in the late ’90s I knew I had found our home in Milan.”

References for the Palazzo collection expanded to run the international gamut. Whereas the Montaigne console pays homage to French Rococo (think cabriole legs hand-gilded foliate relief ) the Elsworth bar cabinet is a classic ode to Italy incorporating walnut maple ebony and mahogany inlay as marquetry. Fabrics tell their own story ranging from classic tartans to bold zebra prints. Other highlights include the Falaise chandelier—a grand branching beauty rendered in natural brass—and the Bradburn chesterfield a slender riff on the English sofa that breaks from the marshmallow heft and rolled arms of its traditional predecessor.

The fabrics in the collection are a richly layered mix of tartans tweeds prints damasks and velvets. Photo: François Halard

They’re the sort of pieces one might easily mistake for generations-olds heirlooms which is precisely the spirit of the collection overall. Quality and authenticity—both to history and to the brand—form through lines. It’s a commitment Ralph Lauren will continue in Milan where the company opened a European flagship complete with The Bar at Ralph Lauren on Via della Spiga last November. And plans are already under way for the city’s design week next year.

This marks Ralph Lauren’s 17th year as the official outfitter of the tennis tournament and the company will outfit more than 250 on-court officials and 400 ball crew members. The ball crew staff will sport an exploded print in navy with pops of orange and green.

Their Polo shirts will once again be made from yarn created from recycled plastic bottles. Ralph Lauren and Wilson which supplies the balls collect plastic tennis ball cans during the tournament that are used for future fabric production.

In 2021 more than 540 pounds of ball cans were collected which were then processed into yarn.

The ball crew will wear Polo shirts made from recycled plastic bottles.

This year Ralph Lauren will also become the official sunglass sponsor of the U.S. Open and will offer two styles featuring the Pony player and U.S. Open logos in a shiny Havana colorway.

Ralph Lauren will offer customers the opportunity to customize polo shirts water bottles and tote bags as part of its Create-Your-Own program that will be available at the tournament and on ralphlauren.com.

It will host a live-shopping event on TikTok to celebrate the tournament highlighting one exclusive item from this year’s collection.

The campaign was shot at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center and features five ball crew members alongside a group of models wearing pieces from the U.S. Open line as well as the men’s and women’s Polo Ralph Lauren spring summer and fall 2022 collections.

The company will unveil an updated luxury hospitality suite at the event featuring products from the Ralph Lauren Home collection and inspired by a classic Hamptons house. A custom cocktail called the “Courtside Spritz” has been created as well. It will feature Grey Goose vodka Champagne and grapefruit liqueur with a citrus twist and will be available throughout the duration of the tournament at The Polo Bar in New York City.

For those unable to make it out to Flushing Ralph Lauren’s Madison Avenue store will livestream tennis matches in its windows and the Prince Street and Manhasset stores will also offer tennis-related events.

The U.S. Open fan collection will be sold at select Polo Ralph Lauren shops and on-site at the tournament as well as online at ralphlauren.com for the duration of the event.

Two ex-brokers in Vero Beach Florida who were promptly fired from Raymond James & Associates in May after their arrests for cocaine possession have joined Wedbush Securities as investment advisors according to registration records.

M. Paul Massey and William Romans had spent their entire 23-year brokerage careers at Raymond James but were discharged from the firm on May 4 for “[c]onduct inconsistent with professional conduct policies” according to Form U5s the company filed. As of August 1 they are registered with Wedbush solely as investment advisors in the state of California according to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Investment Adviser Public Disclosure database.

Massey who served as branch manager for Raymond James’ Vero Beach branch and Romans have hired separate attorneys to handle their criminal cases pending in Indian River County according to court records. Massey has a drug court date later this month while Romans in June entered a not guilty plea to the charges and demanded a trial by jury according to court dockets. (In Florida drug court programs are voluntary court-supervised alternatives to prosecution and incarceration for first time drug offenders and involve substance abuse treatment and regular testing.)

West Palm Beach lawyer L.D. “Donnie” Murrell who is listed in court records as representing Massey in the matter did not immediately respond to a request for comment nor did Vero Beach lawyer Andrew Metcalf who according to court records is representing Romans.

The pair had been arrested in the early morning hours of May 1 on felony charges of cocaine possession and misdemeanor charges of drug paraphernalia possession stemming from an early morning traffic stop in their Vero Beach neighborhood.

Their relatively quick termination on May 4 reflects major brokerage firms’ increasing sensitivity to reputational risk in the internet age an outside industry recruiter Phil Waxelbaum previously said. Some firms previously may have been more willing to wait until there was an outcome in the court case particularly for larger producers.

A felony criminal conviction would result in statutory disqualification from the industry under SEC and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority guidelines.

A spokeswoman for Los Angeles-based Wedbush said Massey and Romans joined the firm’s independent contractor channel but declined to comment on the hires or how the firm evaluated the charges. Wedbush firm has around 400 “investment professionals” in 100 offices according to its website. (Raymond James which is based in St. Petersburg Florida has more than 8600.)

Massey on his LinkedIn profile which has not been updated to reflect his exit from Raymond James or move to Wedbush wrote that he helped “High Net Worth Clients and Advisors manage over $1 Billion in client assets” at Raymond James.

Massey and Romans had been passengers in a pickup truck driven by a third individual who was charged at the scene with DUI and felony cocaine possession according to police records.

A Sheriff’s Office sergeant had initiated the traffic stop at about 2:30 a.m. ET after seeing a blue Chevrolet pickup truck failing to maintain its lane and “touching the grass at one point” according to police records.

The truck ultimately stopped at Massey’s home where the sergeant approached the vehicle and found Massey in the front passenger seat and Romans in the backseat according to police records. A subsequent search of the vehicle yielded residue and a baggy of about 11 grams of “white powdery substance” that tested positive as cocaine a sergeant wrote in the report.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndmbGEuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9idWNjYW5lZXJzL25ldy1vZmZlcmluZ3MtYXQtcmF5bW9uZC1qYW1lcy1zdGFkaXVtLWFubm91bmNlZC1mb3ItMjAyMi1idWNzLXNlYXNvbi_SAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZmxhLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvYnVjY2FuZWVycy9uZXctb2ZmZXJpbmdzLWF0LXJheW1vbmQtamFtZXMtc3RhZGl1bS1hbm5vdW5jZWQtZm9yLTIwMjItYnVjcy1zZWFzb24vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New offerings at Raymond James Stadium announced for 2022 Bucs season,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wfla.com/sports/buccaneers/new-offerings-at-raymond-james-stadium-announced-for-2022-bucs-season/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndmbGEuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9idWNjYW5lZXJzL25ldy1vZmZlcmluZ3MtYXQtcmF5bW9uZC1qYW1lcy1zdGFkaXVtLWFubm91bmNlZC1mb3ItMjAyMi1idWNzLXNlYXNvbi_SAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZmxhLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvYnVjY2FuZWVycy9uZXctb2ZmZXJpbmdzLWF0LXJheW1vbmQtamFtZXMtc3RhZGl1bS1hbm5vdW5jZWQtZm9yLTIwMjItYnVjcy1zZWFzb24vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53dHNwLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3Nwb3J0cy9uZmwvYnVjY2FuZWVycy9idWNjYW5lZXJzLW5ldy1zZWF0aW5nLXJheW1vbmQtamFtZXMtc3RhZGl1bS82Ny1jNmRkYTY1MC1hYzNkLTRmODQtYWMwYi00NjE0OTA0YmUyOGbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New offerings available at Raymond James Stadium for 2022 season | wtsp.com,"The team says the new offerings will ""enhance the gameday experience for Buccaneers fans at Raymond James Stadium.""

TAMPA Fla. — As the 2022 season for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers quickly approaches with Saturday's preseason home opener against the Miami Dolphins the NFL team has unveiled new offerings for its ride-or-die fans.

The team says in a news release the new offerings will ""enhance the game day experience for Buccaneers fans at Raymond James Stadium.""

Earlier this offseason the Bucs announced an additional seating area added called ""The Krewe's Nest"" which will be located in the south end zone of the stadium.

There will be 3600 more seats which will allow the stadium to seat nearly 70000 football fans at once this season.

But the one downside of the newest addition is the standing-room-only fan section on the south end zone concourse was removed to make room for the additional temporary seats.

“The addition of The Krewe’s Nest for this season is going to play a huge role in helping us create an unmatched atmosphere for games at Raymond James Stadium” Buccaneers Chief Operating Officer Brian Ford said in a statement. “We are always focused on finding ways to create the best gameday experiences for our members and this is another example of that.”

Fans sitting in the Krewe's Nest will be able to buy drinks and food from the comfort of their seats through food vendors stationed throughout the location.

Along with the new seating there will also be a first-ever expedited entry lane at Raymond James Stadium. Cardholders of the team-branded debit card will be given access to the Fifth Third Bank Gate Fast Lane along with discounts on food and merchandise.

“With nearly 70000 fans expected at every home game this season the Fifth Third Bank Gate Fast Lane will be a terrific addition to the gameday experience for those cardholders to ensure an efficient and worry-free entry through the gates” Ford said in the statement.

Once fans are inside the stadium there are other new offerings to look forward to as well. There will be an ""even greater selection of new and upgraded food offerings...""

From PDQ and Aussie Grill football watchers won't go hungry with tons of food to look forward to including:

New York strip sandwich

Pork carnitas tacos

Calzones

Brauhaus pretzels

Footlong hot dog

Loaded yucca fries

Loaded tater tots

Bang bang shrimp tatchos

Bacon and cheese all beef burger

Citrus chicken nachos

“We know that the quality and selection of food offerings plays a large role in the gameday experience and that is why we have worked closely with our hospitality partners at Legends to continue raising the bar on all food and beverage throughout Raymond James Stadium” Ford explained in the release. “Our fans have grown accustomed to enjoying the best hospitality options and we look forward to continuing to exceed their expectations.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1Y2NhbmVlcnMuY29tL25ld3Mva3Jld2VzLW5lc3QtZW5kLXpvbmUtc2VhdGluZy1maWZ0aC10aGlyZC1iYW5rLWdhdGUtZmFzdC1sYW5lLXVwZ3JhZGVkLWZvb2TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Krewe's Nest End Zone Seating Fifth Third Bank Gate Fast Lane and Upgraded Food Options Highlight New Offerings ...,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBpcGVyZnVuZXJhbGhvbWUuY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvcmF5bW9uZC1icm93btIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Raymond J.

This time the company has tested the card against the RTX 3060 on 1080p Ultra and 1440p High in DirectX12 and Vulkan titles. Per Intel’s findings the Arc A750 managed to beat the RTX 3060 by 3 to 5% on average.

4 Reviews

Following the five-game first-party benchmark of the Arc A750 released in July Intel has now unveiled benchmark results for nearly 50 games where the company compared the Arc A750 with the Nvidia RTX 3060. Intel tested most games on DirectX 12 and six games on Vulkan at 1080p Ultra and 1440p High settings.

According to Intel’s testing the Arc A750 managed to overtake the RTX 3060 by 3% on average when running games at 1080p Ultra using DX12. The 1080p-lead increased to 4% on Vulkan. The Arc A750 came out ahead of the RTX 3060 by 5% at 1080p and 1440p on both DX12 and Vulkan.

Upon analyzing the individual games we get to see that the Arc A750 traded blows with Nvidia’s offering on both DX12 and Vulkan. For instance in AC: Valhalla the Arc A750 produced 67 fps at 1080p Ultra on DX12 compared to 76 managed by the RTX 3060. On 1440p High Intel’s champion scored a respectable 62 fps while the RTX 3060 remained ahead with 67 fps.

Moving on the Arc A750 handily beat the RTX 3060 in CoD: Warzone at both 1080p and 1440p managing 130 and 115 fps respectively compared to RTX 3060’s result of 98 and 75 fps.

The story played out similarly on Vulkan. For instance in DOOM Eternal Intel’s board performed better than Team Green’s offering by about 5 fps scoring 200 fps. The roles were reversed in 1440p where the RTX 3060 came out on top with 166 fps compared to 158 fps produced by the Arc A750.

Although the Arc A750 is looking impressive in this latest first-party showing take the benchmark results with a pinch of salt as the board hasn’t been tested by independent third-party reviewers. Sadly we don’t know when Intel is planning to release the GPU as the company is remaining tight-lipped about the availability full specifications and price of the board.

In a video and accompanying post today company representatives Ryan Shrout and Tom Peterson compared the upcoming Arc A750 card to Nvidia's RTX 3060 in a few dozen DirectX12 and Vulkan games They demonstrated that the card is usually able to keep up with the most popular member of the RTX 3000 GPU family.

In a series of tests at 1080p and 1440p Intel's tests show that the A750 usually comes within a few percent of the RTX 3060's performance sometimes overperforming (Cyberpunk 2077 Fortnite Microsoft Flight Simulator) sometimes underperforming (Assassin's Creed Valhalla Deathloop) and sometimes roughly matching Nvidia's average frame rates (DOTA 2 Hitman 3 Death Stranding). Average FPS is just one way to measure game performance—crucially Intel didn't provide any minimum or 1 percent low frame rates which can have more of an impact on how smooth your game feels when you're playing it. But if you take these tests at face value the Arc A750 does at least appear to be a viable midrange GPU competitor.

Of course there is one important metric in which Intel's Arc GPU can't compete with Nvidia's: The RTX 3060 is a graphics card you can go out and buy and install in your PC today and the Arc A750 isn't. Rumors out of this year's SIGGRAPH conference where Intel has been giving technical demos of its GPUs and announcing a few workstation-oriented Arc Pro products suggest that we could still see an Arc hardware launch by the end of the summer. But officially the company still has no news to share about a concrete launch window.

Delays and driver troubles have made Arc's launch bumpy. And by failing to get products to market while the Great GPU Shortage of late 2020/all of 2021/early 2022 was still ongoing the company missed an opportunity to establish an install base by selling to gamers desperate to buy any kind of GPU.

Intel's strongest argument for its new GPUs might be its three-tier pricing strategy. The company categorizes games using one of three performance tiers: Tier 1 is newer games using modern APIs that have been specifically optimized for Arc GPUs Tier 2 is games that use modern DirectX12 and Vulkan APIs but don't have any Arc-specific optimizations and Tier 3 is older DirectX and OpenGL titles. All of the games in today's comparison are Tier 1 or Tier 2 titles but Intel says Arc's pricing will be determined by its competitiveness in Tier 3 games.

Because Arc struggles so much with games in this third tier it could mean that the A750 will come in substantially below the RTX 3060's official MSRP of $329 (its current street price based on a cursory non-scientific check of Amazon and Newegg is closer to $400). Early benchmarks have shown the DirectX11 version of Shadow of the Tomb Raider running at half the speed of the DirectX12 version. A card that performs like an RTX 3060 in newer games while being priced more like an RTX 3050 or 1650 could be attractive for some bargain hunters regardless of the other teething issues Arc is having.

The Arc A750 is the second-fastest Arc GPU we know about; a somewhat faster A770 will presumably compete with the RTX 3060 Ti or RTX 3070.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzgvMTEvMjMzMDEyMzAvaW50ZWwtYXJjLWE3NTAtYmVuY2htYXJrcy1ydHgtMzA2MC1jb21wZXRpdGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel shares 48 benchmarks to show its Arc A750 can compete with an RTX 3060,"Intel has released 48 benchmarks that show its upcoming Arc A750 GPU should be able to trade blows with Nvidia’s RTX 3060 running modern games. While Intel set its expectations low for its Arc GPUs last month the company has now tested its A750 directly against the RTX 3060 across 42 DirectX 12 titles and six Vulkan games.

The results look promising for what will likely be Intel’s mainstream GPU later this year. Intel has tested the A750 against popular games like Fortnite Control and Call of Duty: Warzone instead of the cherry picked handful of benchmarks the company released last month.

“These are all titles that we picked because they’re popular” explains Intel fellow Tom Petersen in Intel’s benchmark video. “Either reviewers are using them or they’re high on the Steam survey or new and exciting. These are not cherry picked titles.”

We’ll have to wait for independent benchmarks but based on Intel’s testing the A750 looks like it will compete comfortably with Nvidia’s RTX 3060. “You’ll see we’re kinda trading blows with the RTX 3060” says Petersen. “Sometimes we win sometimes we lose.” Intel’s performance is on average 3 to 5 percent better than Nvidia’s when it wins on titles running at 1080p.

Over on the 1440p side it looks like Intel wins on more of the benchmarks. On average it’s a win of about 5 percent across the 42 games. Intel has also tested six Vulkan titles where it seems be trading blows with the RTX 3060 once again.

“We’re mostly winning at 1080p and mostly winning at 1440p with Vulkan” claims Petersen. “On average I’d say this is more like a 3 to 5 percent maybe a little bit more towards the 5 percent win on Vulkan.”

Intel has only focused on modern APIs here and not older DirectX 11 games. Early testing of Intel’s Arc A770 GPU — a step above the A750 in the Arc lineup — showed a big performance gap between DirectX 11 and DirectX 12 games. Intel is still working on its Arc GPU drivers and it could be some time before the company is able to improve DirectX 11 performance.

Intel performed these latest benchmarks on identical systems running its Core i9 12900K CPU and 32GB of DDR5 memory. Intel used its own engineering driver and Nvidia’s 516.59 driver for the comparisons. Arc GPUs will require 10th Gen or newer Intel processors or AMD Ryzen 3000 and above CPUs all with motherboards that support Resizable BAR (or as AMD brands it Smart Access Memory). Resizable BAR is a key requirement for performance on Arc GPUs.

We’re still waiting for Intel to release its Arc A750 GPU later this year but these latest benchmarks do show it could be ready to compete for the all-important mainstream. Intel hasn’t announced official specifications or pricing for its Arc A750 yet but leaked slides put it in between $299 and $399.

Intel will need to reach a price point that can compete with Nvidia’s $329 pricing for the RTX 3060 particularly now that GPU stock has greatly improved and there is the option of AMD’s Radeon RX 6600 XT at $379.

All eyes will now be on Nvidia’s plans for its RTX 40-series of GPUs. Nvidia recently slashed the prices of its high-end RTX 30 series GPUs and the discounts could indicate an RTX 40-series launch is due in the coming months. Rumors had suggested the RTX 4090 could launch last month but July came and went without any new GPUs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9nYW1pbmctdGVjaC9ydHgtMzA5MC13b3J0aC1idXlpbmctYXVndXN0LTIwMjLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RTX 3090 is not worth buying in August 2022,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sportskeeda.com/gaming-tech/rtx-3090-worth-buying-august-2022 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9nYW1pbmctdGVjaC9ydHgtMzA5MC13b3J0aC1idXlpbmctYXVndXN0LTIwMjLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vdWsucGNtYWcuY29tL2dyYXBoaWNzLWNhcmRzLzE0MjAxMy9pbnRlbC1hcmMtYTc1MC1iZWF0cy1udmlkaWFzLXJ0eC0zMDYwLWF0LWxlYXN0LW9uLW5ld2VyLWdhbWVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel: Arc A750 Beats Nvidia's RTX 3060 at Least on Newer Games,"Last week Intel admitted its upcoming Arc graphics cards can suffer a performance drag when it comes to older PC games. But now the company is showing off how the Arc A750 GPU can shine while running the latest PC titles.

The company released a video with benchmarks comparing the A750 against Nvidia's RTX 3060 graphics card across nearly 50 titles including Call of Duty: Warzone Cyberpunk 2077 and Microsoft Flight Simulator.

All the PC titles used DirectX 12 or the Vulkan API and the test compared the GPUs' performance using frames per second. The results show the A750 trading blows with the RTX 3060 when it comes to 1080p gaming at ultra settings.

As you can see the A750 excels in some games while the RTX 3060 performs better in others. However Intel’s graphic card showed a bigger advantage at 1440p gaming.

In a majority of the tested games the Arc A750 comes out on top over the RTX 3060. ""On average if you’re looking at the mean across all these things we’re winning by between 3 and 5%"" Intel graphics fellow Tom Petersen says in the video.

Intel also published an article that contains the average FPS Intel achieved on the various games. So interested buyers can see whether the Arc A750 achieves desired performance.

Ultimately Intel’s video tries to demonstrate how Arc GPUs are a competitive alternative to rival products from Nvidia and AMD. The problem is that the company still hasn’t given us a price or launch date for the A750 graphics card which will also determine if the hardware is worth buying. For now Intel has only said the desktop Arc GPUs will arrive sometime this quarter.

In the meantime gamers can easily purchase an RTX 3060 which has been available for more than a year now and starts at $369. Nvidia is also preparing to launch next-generation GPUs likely later this fall.

The other drawback is how Intel is still optimizing the Arc graphics cards for older PC games that run DirectX 11 or older APIs. The company has conveniently avoided posting benchmarks for these titles. But a video Intel did with Linus Tech Tips shows the company’s more powerful Arc A770 card can only achieve 40fps on the game Shadow of the Tomb Raider while using DirectX 11 down from 80fps when using DirectX 12."
O,Realty Income,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNkYmouY29tL2ZpbmFuY2Uvc3RvY2tzL3Nsb3ctYW5kLXN0ZWFkeS13aW5zLXJhY2UtZm9yLWRpdmlkZW5kLWFyaXN0b2NyYXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Slow and Steady Wins Race for ‘Dividend Aristocrat’,"Last month San Diego-based Realty Income Corp. (NYSE: O) announced that its board of directors had declared the 625th consecutive common stock monthly dividend in the company’s history. The dividend $0.2475 per share represents an annualized dividend of $2.97 per share for Realty Income’s famously loyal shareholders.

The company a member of the S&P 500 also belongs to an even more select club known as the S&P 500 ‘Dividend Aristocrats’ because of its consistent record of dividend payouts.

Since debuting on the NYSE in 1994 O shares have posted an impressive 15.3% total compound annual return – including dividends – earning Realty Income the nickname ‘The Monthly Dividend Company.’

“We invest in people and places to deliver dependable monthly dividends that increase over time” said a statement from the company issued along with the announcement of its 625th straight dividend.

The company’s rock-solid track record has attracted fans across Wall Street. Samuel Smith a financial blogger for TipRanks is one of a growing number of analysts who are bullish on O shares.

“Realty Income’s strong recent performance momentum overwhelming analyst bullishness compelling competitive advantages and attractive dividend yield plus growth profile make it currently considerably appealing” Smith said.

“In a world filled with uncertainty O stock continues to stand out as a source of reliability and stability for investors looking for a steady income stream” Smith added.

In 2022’s volatile stock market – buffeted by rising inflation – an increasing number of investors have embraced dividend-paying stocks especially companies that while still growing have a stable track record of paying consistent dividends in both bull and bear markets.

With many big-name Wall Street stocks down more than 50% so far in 2022 Realty Income’s stock is trading around $75 a share just below its 52-week high. For the company the numbers speak for themselves: In 2021 Realty Income notched revenue of $2.08 billion a 26.31% increase just from 2020. And O is up nearly 5% so far in 2022.

“We are pleased with the continued momentum across all facets of our business” Realty Income CEO Sumit Roy said earlier this year. Roy who is also company president and a board director is a veteran investment banker with an MBA in finance and economics from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

“Our business is by design well-positioned to excel amidst a variety of macroeconomic climates” Roy said. “During the [first quarter of 2022] we invested approximately $1.6 billion in high-quality real estate and are encouraged by a healthy pipeline of opportunities globally.”

VEREIT Merger Closed

Realty Income founded by William E. Clark Jr. and Evelyn Joan Clark in 1969 is structured as a REIT (real estate investment trust) with monthly dividends supported by the cash flow from over 11200 real estate properties owned under long-term net lease agreements with commercial clients around the globe.

To date the company has increased the dividend on its stock 116 times since its initial public listing.

In late 2021 Realty Income completed a merger with Phoenix-based real estate investment trust VEREIT (NYSE: VER). The combined company began trading Nov. 1 2021 on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “O.”

As part of the merger agreement two VEREIT directors Priscilla Almodovar and Mary Hogan Preusse were appointed to Realty Income’s 11-member board of directors.

“With the closing of the VEREIT merger” Roy said “we believe our size scale and diversification will further enhance many of our competitive advantages accelerate our investment activities and enhance shareholder value for years to come.”

Protesters stood in front of the offices of the real estate firm DeFalco Realty in Bay Ridge on the morning of Aug. 5 accusing the company of discriminating against potential tenants based on their source of income

Amid the current a hectic environment in New York City’s housing market where many locals are at risk of losing their homes because of rising rent prices protestors say the realty firm ignores applicants who would be paying with rental assistance and voucher programs like CityFHEPS.

Multiple rejections from DeFalco Realty

Among protesters who were led by members of housing and homelessness advocacy groups VOCAL-NY and UnlockNYC was Douglas Powell a voucher recipient with $2218 in monthly rental aid who has been living at a homeless shelter in Staten Island for three years and has been consistently trying to rent an apartment in Brooklyn. Powell has applied to over 20 apartments through different real state companies with no results and has been denied DeFalco’s services three times as soon as he mentions vouchers he said.

“They are not supposed to say but after calling so much they once told me on the phone ‘We don’t accept vouchers’” Powell said. “As soon as I say vouchers I don’t hear from them no more.”

On his phone Powell has a long list of texts he has sent to realtors who are quick to respond but then fade away at the mention of vouchers.

Under local state and federal law it is illegal for landlords owners and real estate brokers to refuse to rent to tenants seeking to pay for housing with housing assistance vouchers subsidies or other forms of public assistance.

Joe Loonam a campaign coordinator with UnlockNYC and Powell recently ran an experiment to evidence DeFalco’s unlawful practices. They both applied to rent an apartment at the same time. At the mention of vouchers Powell was immediately ignored while Loonam’s was approved.

“It’s a completely different kind of tone and conversation with me” Loonam said.

When reached by phone DeFalco staff refused to comment. On the window of their office hangs a statement that reads “Equal housing opportunities. We do business in accordance with the Federal Fair Housing Law.”

‘Hold them accountable:’ addressing income discrimination

The city’s Commission on Human Rights has resolved over 350 cases of source of income discrimination in the last few years according to their website and has successfully obtained more than $100000 in damages and penalties from discriminatory companies and landlords. Fines of up to $2000 have been issued against realty companies for denying vouchers as forms of rent payment. Filing a complaint of discrimination and receiving services from the commission is free.

“If you believe that no one should be homeless if you believe that 100 thousand children should not go to school from a shelter you need to be where the people are” said VOCAL-NY organizer Celina Trowell as she addressed DeFalco at the protest. The advocacy group will hold another protest to call for the city’s support to eradicate housing discrimination at the steps of the City Hall in Manhattan on Aug. 11 at 11 am.

“You need to hold them accountable” Trowell said. “They are part of the problem.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9mb3VyLXJlaXRzLXBheS1tb250aGx5LWRpdmlkZW5kcy0xNjI5MTczMTYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Four REITS That Pay Monthly Dividends,"One of the big advantages of owning certain real estate investment trusts (REITs) over common stock is this: Some pay dividends monthly. Stocks pay dividends quarterly which is nice but monthly sounds better to more than a few investors. With that in mind here are five REITs paying the monthly dividends.

1. Agree Realty Corp. (NYSE: ADC) pays a 3.61% annualized dividend and trades on the New York Stock Exchange with an average daily volume of 815000 shares. The monthly dividend payment is $0.23 per share.

The company is primarily focused on the ownership acquisition development and management of retail properties net leased to industry-leading tenants. Agree has been in business since 1971 and has been publicly traded since its 1994 initial public offering.

Credit Suisse Group AG analysts initiated coverage of the REIT in June with an outperform rating. Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC) in June upgraded Agree from neutral to buy.

The short float sits at a relatively high 12% — something to keep in mind if those who are short are ever forced to cover that could provide fuel for a rally.

2. EPR Properties (NYSE: EPR) is traded on the New York Stock Exchange and pays an annual dividend yield of 6.19%. The monthly dividend payment comes to $0.28 per share. This real estate investment trust is relatively lightly traded with an average daily volume of just 469000 shares.

EPR is focused on properties offering entertainment recreation and leisure activities. The company owns total investments worth $6.6 billion with 358 locations and 200 tenants in 44 states and Canada. Janney Montgomery Scott in upgraded EPR in July from neutral to buy and Raymond James Financial Inc. (NYSE: RJF) upgraded the REIT in June from market perform to strong buy with a price target of $62 per share.

3. Realty Income Corp. (NYSE: O) pays a monthly dividend of $0.29 per share for an annualized yield of 4.04%. The company owns 11400 real estate properties under long-term net lease agreements with commercial clients according to its website.

Analysts at one of the big investment firms like the REIT. Credit Suisse initiated coverage in June with an outperform rating. Realty Income is heavily traded with an average daily volume of 3.89 million shares an amount indicating the presence of large institutional investors and traders.

4. SL Green Realty Corp (NYSE: SLG) bills itself as “New York City’s largest owner of office real estate.” The New York Stock Exchange-traded REIT pays a monthly dividend of $0.31 per share for an annualized dividend yield of 7.88%. With a current price-to-earnings ratio of 7.5 and trading at just 68% of book value SL Green Realty may fit the profile of a value stock.

Story continues

Credit Suisse initiated coverage of the REIT in June with a neutral rating and Mizuho Bank Ltd. initiated coverage in April also with a neutral rating. The short float of 10% is notable — if shorts are ever forced to cover that could fuel a rally.

Those are four real estate investment trusts offering monthly dividends. While it may be sweet to be the recipient of monthly rather than quarterly dividends investors should always look deep and make sure the underlying REIT makes sense as a business.

On Tuesday (August 9) Curry Brand unveiled the new hardwood floors and hoops to over seventy kids who waited a month for their surprise.

The court was redesigned by comic book artist Damion Scott known for his work on Black Panther Spider-Man Batgirl and more. For the court Scott drew inspiration from comic books his hip-hop roots and Martin Luther King Jr.’s legacy for the gym’s remodel.

More from VIBE.com

Scott also sought out local Long Beach Boys & Girls Club youth to add two murals to the redesign. The youth were tasked with drawing themselves as superheroes representing strength in community and sports.

Curry spoke about their mission statement and detailed sports’ deeper connections to humanity.

“We want to provide a space where you can come enjoy yourself and get lost in fun lost in the competition invest in yourselves and be around a lot of amazing coaches and programs” the four-time NBA Champion said to the Long Beach kids. “This is the beginning of hopefully an amazing journey not just in sports but in life. Sports teach you so much about life building great character being part of teams and believing in yourself.”

In addition Snoop offered insight on the Boys & Girls Club LBC location and how much of his roots are engrained there.

“This is where I learned how to play basketball play football be active in the community and build relationships” the 17-time Grammy-nominated artist said. “It’s where I learned how to rap talk and just be me – in this park. For us to give these kids more opportunities than we had – that’s what it’s really about.”

According to Under Armour since Curry Brand’s inception in 2020 Steph and Snoop have been finding ways to give back to the youth. The duo powered by Under Armour set out on a mission to affect 100000 youth and recondition 20 safe places to play by 2025 with the LBC court being the latest.

Firehouse Subs reported sales that lagged the results of the company’s other brands.

Jose Cil

Total sales at Firehouse Subs restaurants rose 2.2% to $292 million in the second quarter but sales at stores open for more than one year fell 1.4% RBI reported Aug. 4.

“This second quarter was a tough comp to the prior year period which benefited from stimulus and where Firehouse posted an incredibly strong comp sales performance of 31%” RBI Chief Executive Jose Cil said in the company’s conference call with analysts.

“The team worked to offset this by creative traffic-driving initiatives such as May’s Name of the Day promotion to keep Firehouse Subs top of mind” he said.

RBI’s three other chains Burger King Popeyes and Tim Hortons all increased comparable-store sales with those brands posting a combined 9% rise in comp sales.

Toronto-based RBI acquired Firehouse in December.

“Looking ahead we’re focused on accelerating the brand’s development and continuing to enhance Firehouse Subs’ digital capabilities specifically as it relates to enhancing the loyalty program and e-commerce infrastructure” Cil said.

New RYAM CEO stays the course

In his first quarterly conference call since becoming CEO of Rayonier Advanced Materials Inc. De Lyle Bloomquist said the company’s strategy hasn’t changed.

That includes calling the company “RYAM” (pronounced rye-um) a rebranding strategy announced by predecessor Vito Consiglio during the company’s previous conference call May 4.

Four weeks later RYAM announced Consiglio was leaving after just five months on the job with Bloomquist succeeding him as chief executive of the struggling Jacksonville-based cellulose specialty products company.

In the Aug. 4 conference call Bloomquist did not address why Consiglio was replaced. But Bloomquist did point out he served on the board of directors for eight years and as chairman of the board since 2020 so he basically is staying the course.

“Because of my tenure on RYAM’s board I have been involved in creating our strategy” he said.

RYAM has reported three straight years of losses from continuing operations and that has continued into 2022. The company reported a second-quarter net loss of $23 million or 36 cents a share.

Bloomquist said he wants to grow the business including expanding into other “bio-solutions” products.

His main challenge is the company’s debt.

“I’m going to be focused on paying down debt and keeping the leverage at a reasonable level” he said.

Rayonier earnings fall on disruptions

Rayonier Inc. the timber and real estate company that split up with RYAM in 2014 reported second-quarter earnings of 16 cents a share down from adjusted earnings of 22 cents the previous year.

“We are pleased with our second quarter results particularly given the challenges presented by rising costs across our segments as well as continued COVID-related disruptions in our export business” said CEO David Nunes in an Aug. 3 news release.

The disruptions particularly affected its New Zealand timber operations as coronavirus lockdowns in China reduced demand.

That offset gains in Rayonier’s Southeast and Northwest U.S. timber operations.

Regency Centers raises forecast

Regency Centers Corp. reported funds from operations (earnings excluding noncash charges) of $1 a share in the second quarter up just a penny from last year.

However the Jacksonville-based developer of grocery-anchored shopping centers raised its FFO forecast for the full year from a range of $3.84 to $3.90 a share to $3.92 to $3.96.

“We know that we’re not immune to the adverse impacts of inflation interest rate increases and recessionary risks all of which could have implications for us. But we very much believe that we are extremely well positioned to weather any economic storm” CEO Lisa Palmer said in Regency’s Aug. 5 conference call.

Palmer said the market areas of its centers are more resistant to inflation and economic pressure.

“In times when tenant bankruptcies may be elevated our locations tend to be among the best performing limiting occupancy decline” she said.

Regency’s portfolio of 404 properties was 94.2% leased as of June 30.

Texas acquisition lifts Dream Finders

Dream Finders Homes Inc. reported a big increase in second-quarter sales and earnings helped by an acquisition in Texas last year.

The Jacksonville-based homebuilder said revenue more than doubled to $793 million and earnings almost doubled to 60 cents a share from 31 cents in the second quarter of 2021.

The operations of McGuyer Homebuilders Inc. which Dream Finders acquired in October 2021 accounted for 527 of the company’s 1649 home closings in the second quarter.

Although rising interest rates are affecting the housing market the company reaffirmed its guidance of at least 7000 home closings this year.

“This outlook considers the rapid increase in interest rates and overall moderation of the housing market that began at the end of the second quarter of 2022 and assumes general economic conditions including interest rates and mortgage availability remain similar to those experienced in the latter half of the second quarter of 2022” the company said in an Aug. 4 news release.

Fidelity: Title market remains strong

Fidelity National Financial Inc. reported lower second-quarter earnings but CEO Mike Nolan said in an Aug. 3 conference call that the Jacksonville-based title insurer’s business remains strong.

“Given the daily commentary in the media it is easy to lose perspective on the current state of the U.S. housing market” he said.

“While we expect residential purchase demand to continue to moderate in the second half of the year as compared to the record levels seen last year 2022 will still be one of the strongest residential purchase markets in the last 15 years.”

Revenue in the quarter of $2.63 billion was 32% lower than last year as a decline in refinance volume reduced demand for title insurance this year.

Adjusted earnings of $1.90 a share were down from $2.06 the previous year. But the earnings were well above the consensus forecast of $1.63 by analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.

Black Knight earnings rise

Mortgage technology company Black Knight Inc. reported Aug. 4 that second-quarter revenue rose 9% to $394.5 million and adjusted earnings rose by 8 cents a share to 65 cents.

The Jacksonville-based company that was also spun off from Fidelity agreed to a buyout in May by Intercontinental Exchange Inc. so it did not hold a conference call to discuss its results.

ICE held its quarterly conference call Aug. 4 and Benjamin Jackson president of its mortgage technology business said he would not comment on Black Knight as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission reviews the deal.

“We are working with the FTC as they perform their thoughtful and comprehensive reviews of the proposed transaction” Jackson said according to a transcript of the call posted by ICE.

Dun & Bradstreet earnings flat

Dun & Bradstreet Holdings Inc. reported second-quarter adjusted earnings of 25 cents a share the same as last year with revenue rising 3.1% to $537.3 million.

“Our results reflect the disciplined execution of our strategic initiatives and demonstrate the defensible growth nature of our business despite a challenging macro environment” CEO Anthony Jabbour said in an Aug. 4 news release.

Jabbour had also been CEO of Black Knight which is an investor in the Jacksonville-based business data company.

However Jabbour gave up his role of Black Knight chief executive in May.

Patriot Transportation earnings increase

Patriot Transportation Holding Inc. reported earnings of 22 cents a share for the third quarter ended June 30 up from 9 cents the previous year.

The Jacksonville-based trucking company’s revenue rose 13% to $23.5 million.

Patriot which transports mainly petroleum products in the Southeast said it has stabilized its driver count after implementing pay increases starting in April 2021.

FIS CFO James Woodall retiring

As Fidelity National Information Services Inc. or FIS reported second-quarter earnings it said Chief Financial Officer James Woodall is retiring.

Woodall will step down Nov. 4 and be succeeded by Deputy Chief Financial Officer Erik Hoag.

Woodall has been with the Jacksonville-based financial technology company for 14 years and has been CFO since March 2013.

FIS which was spun off from Fidelity National Financial reported Aug. 4 that second-quarter adjusted earnings rose by 12 cents a share to $1.73 with revenue rising 7% to $3.72 billion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmpheGRhaWx5cmVjb3JkLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvYXVnLzExL3dhaXRpbmctZm9yLWEtbG9uZy10aW1lLXB1YmxpeC1vcGVucy1pbi1lYXN0LXNhbi1tYXJjby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Waiting for a long time': Publix opens in East San Marco | Jax Daily Record,"Luke Whipple started the customer line at 4:45 a.m. Aug. 11 for the 7 a.m. opening of the East San Marco Publix store.

“I want some Eggo waffles” he said.

More than that he wanted to see the place.

At 17 the Douglas Anderson School of the Arts senior said he had been hearing about the store his entire life because his dad had worked for Regency Centers Corp. the developer of East San Marco a project talked about for at least two decades.

Douglas Anderson School of the Arts senior Luke Whipple left was first in line with his friend UNF student Ernest Soles second.

A friend since middle school 18-year-old Ernest Soles joined Whipple as second in line.

Soles a University of North Florida student was there for Publix’s chicken tenders saying “it’s like the sign said it’s worth the wait.”

That’s the sign in front of the shopping center at Hendricks Avenue and Atlantic Boulevard.

After 20 years in the making Publix Super Markets Inc. opened the 39209-square-foot store at 2039 Hendricks Ave. that is on the second floor with a parking garage beneath and a surface lot in front.

Customers can take the stairs or one of four elevators that each can handle several customers with shopping carts.

Lakeland-based Publix also opened a separate Publix Liquors on the ground floor.

Customers lined up

About 60 customers were in line about 10 minutes before the opening.

Sherron Watson of Springfield and Janice Poole of San Marco arrived about 6:30 a.m. Watson typically shops at the Publix in Riverside where customers say parking can be a challenge because the lot serves the store and other restaurants and retailers in a small space.

Watson noted that parking in East San Marco was “good so far.”

Sherron Watson of Springfield and Janice Poole of San Marco said the new store will make their grocery shopping more convenient.

Poole lives near East San Marco and until now would choose among three Publix stores several miles away in different directions.

“Being here made it a lot easier” Poole said. “Plus I can walk from the house.”

She considers the first-floor garage and second-floor store “an innovative way to address the space issue.”

Chad Skipper who works at Publix in the Shoppes at RiverTown was in line since 6 a.m. so he could greet his former assistant store manager who was named manager of the East San Marco store.

“They’ve been waiting for this store a long time” he said.

That manager Lauren Hindery led the ribbon-cutting to open the store.

District 5 City Council member LeAnna Cumber said her family moved to the area 12 years ago when a sign was up on the vacant corner lot where East San Marco was built.

“People have been ready for this for 20 years” Cumber said. “It’s such a great addition to the neighborhood.”

She observed that customers of “all ages” were at the opening.

“Our kids can bike here for their chicken tenders” she said of her fourth- and sixth-graders who missed the event because they were at the first day of classes.

Customers quickly circulated through every aisle as dozens of Publix managers and employees offered guidance served samples and thanked visitors.

What’s inside

Publix employs about 120 people at the store said Community Relations Manager Chris Norberg.

The store in tones of dark brown and the Publix signature green features fresh meat seafood and produce including self-service floral; grocery frozen and dairy sections; deli and bakery departments; and a pharmacy.

The deli department positioned as a stand-alone section rather than along the wall like at some Publix stores includes custom subs salads and sandwiches; platters; sushi; an expanded specialty cheese selection; hot meals and sides; grab-and-go entree meals and sides; and Boar’s Head fresh sliced meats and cheeses.

The bakery includes custom cakes platters fresh baked breads and desserts.

Publix also will feature contactless pay options money and lottery services and full-service and self-service checkout.

There are six self-checkouts and six full-service lanes including one express line for customers with 10 or fewer items.

The store is open 7 a.m.-10 p.m. daily.

The pharmacy is open 9 a.m.-9 p.m. Monday-Friday; 9 a.m.-7 p.m. Saturday; and 11 a.m.-6 p.m. Sunday.

The liquors store is open 10 a.m.-9 p.m. Monday-Friday; 9 a.m.-9 p.m. Saturday; and 10 a.m.-8 p.m. Sunday.

A long history

Jacksonville-based Regency Centers Corp. ceremonially broke ground on the site Feb. 16 2021.

“San Marco has deserved this project for a long time” said Patrick McKinley Regency Centers vice president and market officer at the private groundbreaking as the coronavirus pandemic continued into its second year.

Regency Centers is a national owner operator and developer of shopping centers.

The opening of the store started with a ribbon-cutting ceremony.

Initial discussions surfaced in 2002 about a Publix and mixed-use development on the site. In 2006 Regency Centers and The St. Joe Co. announced the project including Publix and condominiums.

The project was delayed by several factors including the recession and a residential development partner that pulled out of the deal in 2017.

In 2018 Regency Centers Chairman and CEO Martin E. “Hap” Stein Jr. said the project would continue but with just the shopping center.

In October 2019 Regency Centers unveiled plans for East San Marco that included the area’s first and so far only two-level Publix building.

It then applied for construction permits totaling 59052 square feet of retail space comprising a two-story building of 76588 square feet with a 39000-square-foot Publix on the top floor and parking on the bottom; a two-story retail building totaling 8665 square feet; a one-story retail building of 9951 square feet; and a 1436-square-foot Publix Liquors store.

The city issued the horizontal work permit in December 2020 for the 3.25-acre site and construction permits starting in February 2021.

The residential land was sold for town houses. Toll Brothers is developing those called the Terraces at San Marco.

More shops coming

Publix is one of several tenants at East San Marco but the first to open.

McKinley said Orangetheory Fitness likely will open by year-end with Crumbl Cookies and St. Johns Eye Associates following early next year.

Foxtail Coffee Co. also is expected to open early next year and the Gemma Fish + Oyster restaurant late in the first quarter.

Can they end 'parachute science' too?,"Aerial view of the Iztapalapa municipality in Mexico City one of the districts whose residents participated in the Mexico City Prospective Study.

MEXICO CITY — Back in 2019 while she worked for the biotech Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Claudia Gonzaga heard a rumor that thrilled her. The company would begin sequencing and analyzing the DNA of 150000 people from Mexico City thanks to a research collaboration with the University of Oxford.

As the only Mexican geneticist at Regeneron Gonzaga saw this as a unique opportunity. She had previously tried to convince her colleagues to sequence the genomes of people from Mexico where researchers have found a stunning amount of human genetic diversity but to no avail. The new partnership meant she would be able to resume her plans. “I was so pleased” she said.

She was similarly surprised when she later learned that Oxford researchers had very much tried to keep this a Mexican study. While Oxford not a Mexican institution had physical custody of all the samples Mexican epidemiologists had actively participated in almost every step of the research and once the genetic data were ready the Oxford team would make them public and offer rapid free and preferential access to Mexican scientists.

It went against the long history of “parachute science” or “helicopter research” — when researchers from wealthier nations visit low- and middle-income countries to collect data and samples analyze them back at home and publish the results with little or no involvement of local scientists.

Gonzaga left the company for academia in 2020 and went back to Mexico. She hasn’t gotten her hands on the data yet though she’s already planning what she’ll do with them such as hunting for genetic variants closely linked to diseases like breast cancer and calculating how frequent they are in Mexicans. And she is pushing to have a physical copy of the genetic biobank hosted at her institution.

“I have many ideas of things we can do” said Gonzaga now a genomicist studying genetic disorders at the International Laboratory for Human Genome Research of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Querétaro. “What I need now is having access to the data.”

The building and study of massive sets of genetic data from Mexicans is part of a global effort to make genetic collections and biobanks which are still too white representative of all humans. Though necessary to achieve that goal international partnerships pose uncomfortable questions such as who owns the data whom to share it with and what for.

Experts mostly laud the Mexico City project for avoiding the worst sins of parachute science and aiming to strengthen research capacity in the country though Oxford controls access to the data and Mexican scientists like Gonzaga are still waiting for it. Some experts also warn that when trying to promote fairer international collaborations and diversify the people they study local researchers must be careful not to perpetuate the same discrimination they sometimes face by excluding Mexico’s many Indigenous populations from participating actively in research involving their communities.

“Let’s not forget that exploitation extractivism and colonialism also exist [in our countries]” said Amaranta Manrique de Lara a genomicist and bioethicist at the General Hospital of Mexico in Mexico City. “In our effort to combat old biases we may be generating new ones.”

In the 1990s a simple yet ambitious question arose: What is killing Mexicans?

“We knew an awful lot about what killed white middle-aged men and women” said Jonathan Emberson a statistical epidemiologist at the University of Oxford. But there was a real dearth of evidence for everyone else he added.

To find that data a group of epidemiologists from Oxford and Mexico’s Secretariat of Health teamed up. Between 1998 and 2004 they sent hundreds of trained nurses to the homes of more than 150000 people in two contiguous districts in Mexico City — Iztapalapa and Coyoacán — to ask about their health history measure their vitals and draw a tube of blood from them. But their blood samples and the DNA within them remained largely untouched for about two decades at Oxford. Until 2019 that is when the team approached Regeneron and the pharmaceutical companies AstraZeneca and AbbVie for help with sequencing and analyzing the genetic material.

It was then that Gonzaga first heard about the Mexico City Prospective Study or MCPS — an ongoing project that has followed participants over the years to understand the social lifestyle physical and genetic causes of complex diseases such as diabetes and obesity. The study resurveyed 10000 surviving participants between 2015 and 2019.

“It really is a waiting game” said Emberson who is the program leader for the MCPS. “You need to wait until sadly enough participants have had diseases of interest — and you don’t get that within just a few years.”

In fact it was not until 2016 that the MCPS published its first major finding. After reviewing the death certificates of participants the researchers found that those with diabetes had a strikingly worse prognosis than that seen in high-income nations. In Mexico City it turns out the rate of death from any cause was almost four times as high among people with diabetes as among those without the disease.

More recently in a preprint published in late June the team added to its extensive evidence the genetic sequences for MCPS participants hoping to find new gene variants associated with diseases. They mostly focused on the exomes regions that make up the 2% of the human genome that code for proteins which drug hunters typically mine to uncover disease-linked changes.

With this the MCPS has become the most extensive genetic study in people outside the U.S. the U.K. or Iceland — which together account for over 72% of all participants in genome-wide association studies known as GWAS which scientists use to hunt for snippets of DNA that may be linked to a certain disease or trait. Latin Americans make up around 8% of all people on the planet yet they constitute 0.25% of all these genetic studies according to the online tracker GWAS Diversity Monitor.

The MCPS genetic sequences have already proven their worth. They were included in a paper published in Science last year that discovered rare mutations that inactivated a gene called GPR75 which was associated with protection against weight gain — people with these variants tended to weigh about 12 pounds less and face a 54% lower risk of obesity than those without the mutation. (Emberson noted that while MCPS data were “a worthwhile addition” to the GPR75 paper the discovery didn’t ultimately depend on any of it. Regeneron spokesperson Ella Campbell however wrote in an email to STAT that they were needed to “ensure the discovery held true with different populations.”)

Regeneron and AstraZeneca have announced they are developing drug candidates directed against GPR75 to treat obesity. Should a medicine eventually reach market Campbell wrote Oxford and Regeneron would be able to share or generate their own intellectual property according to their collaboration agreement.

As the only Mexican institution in the MCPS UNAM equally shares any intellectual property rights with Oxford. “We both own the information” said Jesús Alegre Díaz a medical epidemiologist at UNAM’s Faculty of Medicine in Mexico City and one of the three Mexican principal investigators involved in the MCPS. “We’re Mexicans studying Mexicans.”

Elida Fernández a lawyer at UNAM said a research agreement between both universities was signed in early August with the purpose of resurveying surviving participants. Among other things the contract which STAT reviewed dictates that both UNAM and Oxford can use the samples and data and that the results of the research – including all intellectual property rights data discoveries and patents – will be shared between both institutions.

The vast amount of genetic data pouring out of the MCPS has some Mexican geneticists salivating to get their hands on it.

In 2016 Andrés Moreno Estrada a human population geneticist at Mexico’s National Laboratory of Genomics for Biodiversity in Irapuato and colleagues launched the MX Biobank project which sequenced the DNA of about 6000 people from across the country including many from Indigenous communities and rural areas. Though the biobank also works in partnership with Oxford Moreno Estrada said that they negotiated to keep the guts of the project in Mexico to build its research capacity — the samples are hosted in a Mexican institution the bulk of the genomic analysis is led by the Mexican research team and many of the project’s former students are continuing their careers studying the data they generated.

He recently approached the MCPS researchers in hopes to collaborate and share their respective datasets with each other. “We don’t have their numbers” he said referring to the size of the MCPS dataset. “They are discovering things that we can’t.”

He might need to wait a bit longer.

Regeneron has launched an online browser that includes the genetic variation found across all 150000 participants making it freely accessible to anyone. But the browser for now “is not very useful” said Gonzaga. It lacks key information that makes it difficult to know whether a disease-linked variant is present in 100 or 10000 people for example.

So far the MCPS research group at Oxford holds the custody of the study’s samples and data. “It happens to be that this process has been managed at Oxford at the moment” Emberson said. “But I mean maybe in the future it will be done separately or jointly with UNAM.” The recently signed agreement may allow that.

Still the MCPS has made important progress to support Mexican scientists and strengthen local research capacity. Oxford has trained staff in Mexico and paid for courses and short-term research placements said Emberson. And as soon as the data are clean Mexican researchers will have free and preferential access to it for a period of two years. Researchers based elsewhere in the world will need to pay up to £2500 (about $3000) to receive the data.

The policy feels like “a step in the right direction” said Mashaal Sohail an evolutionary geneticist at UNAM’s Center for Genomic Sciences in Cuernavaca. And one that’s not very common. “Even within Mexico” she said “people are generating data and not sharing it with other academic groups.”

Even if international partnerships move toward fairer conditions some scientists warn that may not be enough.

“Stripping [genomic science] of its colonialism hierarchy and structural violence has to be an everyday task” said Jocelyn Cheé Santiago a Binnizá genomic scientist at UNAM in Mexico City (the Binnizá also known as Zapotec are one of Mexico’s 68 Indigenous groups.) “If we are not going to discuss the colonialism [aspect] of our research then what’s the point?”

For decades Mexico has tried to guard the genetic data of its citizens. In 2008 Congress passed a national law that embraced the idea of “genomic sovereignty” a concept that aims to protect Mexican DNA — by itself absurdly difficult to define critics say — from foreign interests. And many researchers saw it as a way to “break this relationship between us Mexicans as suppliers of samples and foreign scientists as the ones who analyzed [them]” said Ernesto Schwartz-Marín an ethnographer who probes the interaction between race and genomics at the University of Exeter U.K.

But the law has made little difference. Genomic sovereignty “is a bulls— term” Schwartz-Marín said. “It’s impossible to execute because there’s no way to say what the Mexican genome is” or looks like. And there’s no consensus about who is supposed to guard it.

In 2010 the state of Nayarit included a provision in its constitution on genomic sovereignty. Schwartz-Marín indirectly participated in its design and suggested that the language enable Indigenous peoples to protect their own genetic data. “When we tried to get this into the draft” he said “that’s exactly what [legislators] erased.”

The incident is a window into a double standard in Mexico said Manrique de Lara. When studying Indigenous populations or other groups such as people who live with a disability or disease Mexican scientists often “do a lot of this parachute research we so often criticize.” And rare is the case when study participants see any benefits from the science she added.

The way to counter that is by creating fairer collaborations Cheé Santiago said where participants have an active role in the research — such as deciding what questions to ask how to ask them and who has custody over the data. “That we are no longer part of the menu” she said “but part of the table” where decisions are made.

It’s something that’s happening elsewhere. In Australia the National Centre for Indigenous Genomics is governed by a majority-Indigenous board and has approached communities to ask what they wish to do with their samples. In Chile recent efforts to explain the uses and limitations of genetics led scientists and Indigenous people to come together in a three-day workshop. And in countries like the U.S. and Canada the Summer Internship for Indigenous peoples in Genomics (also known as SING) have trained Indigenous participants in genomics and its ethical implications.

Such changes are coming slowly in Mexico. Manrique de Lara and colleagues who teach future geneticists at UNAM’s Center for Genomic Sciences have started to incorporate parachute science scientific colonialism and other bad practices into the syllabus of their classes.

“If we do our job right” she said “we’ll be seeing this internal change in the next generation of researchers.”

From animatronic hands to high-speed running boots and a go-kart that can reach speeds of more than 70 miles per hour the Fort Pierce Florida-based inventor estimates he’s completed at least 60 engineering projects in his spare time. And he’s only 17 years old.

A couple years ago Sansone came across a video about the advantages and disadvantages of electric cars. The video explained that most electric car motors require magnets made from rare-earth elements which can be costly both financially and environmentally to extract. The rare-earth materials needed can cost hundreds of dollars per kilogram. In comparison copper is worth $7.83 per kilogram.

“I have a natural interest in electric motors” says Sansone who had used them in different robotics projects. “With that sustainability issue I wanted to tackle it and try and design a different motor.”

The highschooler had heard of a type of electric motor—the synchronous reluctance motor—that doesn’t use these rare-earth materials. This kind of motor is currently used for pumps and fans but it isn’t powerful enough by itself to be used in an electric vehicle. So Sansone started brainstorming ways he could improve its performance.

Over the course of a year Sansone created a prototype of a novel synchronous reluctance motor that had greater rotational force—or torque—and efficiency than existing ones. The prototype was made from 3-D printed plastic copper wires and a steel rotor and tested using a variety of meters to measure power and a laser tachometer to determine the motor’s rotational speed. His work earned him first prize and $75000 in winnings at this year’s Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) the largest international high school STEM competition.

The less sustainable permanent magnet motors use materials such as neodymium samarium and dysprosium which are in high demand because they’re used in many different products including headphones and earbuds explains Heath Hofmann a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Michigan. Hofmann has worked extensively on electric vehicles including consulting with Tesla to develop the control algorithms for its propulsion drive.

“The number of applications that use magnets just seems to be getting larger and larger” he says. “A lot of the materials are mined in China and so the price can often depend upon our trade status with China.” Hofmann adds that Tesla recently started using permanent magnets in its motors.

Electric motors use rotating electromagnetic fields to spin a rotor. Coils of wire in the stationary outer portion of the motor called the stator produce these electromagnetic fields. In permanent magnet motors magnets attached to the edge of a spinning rotor produce a magnetic field that is attracted to the opposite poles on the spinning field. This attraction spins the rotor.

Synchronous reluctance motors don’t use magnets. Instead a steel rotor with air gaps cut into it aligns itself with the rotating magnetic field. Reluctance or the magnetism of a material is key to this process. As the rotor spins along with the rotating magnetic field torque is produced. More torque is produced when the saliency ratio or difference in magnetism between materials (in this case the steel and the non-magnetic air gaps) is greater.

Instead of using air gaps Sansone thought he could incorporate another magnetic field into a motor. This would increase this saliency ratio and in turn produce more torque. His design has other components but he can’t disclose any more details because he hopes to patent the technology in the future.

“Once I had this initial idea then I had to do some prototyping to try and see if that design would actually work” Sansone says. “I don’t have tons of resources for making very advanced motors and so I had to make a smaller version—a scale model—using a 3-D printer.”

It took several prototypes before he could test his design.

“I didn't have a mentor to help me really so each time a motor failed I had to do tons of research and try and troubleshoot what went wrong” he says. “But eventually on the 15th motor I was able to get a working prototype.”

Sansone tested his motor for torque and efficiency and then reconfigured it to run as a more traditional synchronous reluctance motor for comparison. He found that his novel design exhibited 39 percent greater torque and 31 percent greater efficiency at 300 revolutions per minute (RPM). At 750 RPM it performed at 37 percent greater efficiency. He couldn’t test his prototype at higher revolutions per minute because the plastic pieces would overheat—a lesson he learned the hard way when one of the prototypes melted on his desk he tells Top of the Class a podcast produced by Crimson Education.

In comparison Tesla’s Model S motor can reach up to 18000 RPM explained the company’s principal motor designer Konstantinos Laskaris in a 2016 interview with Christian Ruoff of the electric vehicles magazine Charged.

Sansone validated his results in a second experiment in which he “isolated the theoretical principle under which the novel design creates magnetic saliency” per his project presentation. Essentially this experiment eliminated all other variables and confirmed that the improvements in torque and efficiency were correlated with the greater saliency ratio of his design.

“He's definitely looking at things the right way” Hofmann says of Sansone. “There's the potential that it could be the next big thing.” Though he adds that many professors work on research their whole lives and it’s “fairly rare that they end up taking over the world.”

Hofmann says the materials for synchronous reluctance motors are cheap but the machines are complex and notoriously difficult to manufacture. High manufacturing costs are therefore a barrier to their widespread use—and a major limiting factor to Sansone’s invention.

Sansone agrees but says “with new technologies like additive manufacturing [such as 3-D printing] it would be easier to construct it in the future.”

Sansone is now working on calculations and 3-D modeling for version 16 of his motor which he plans to build out of sturdier materials so he can test it at higher revolutions per minute. If his motor continues to perform with high speed and efficiency he says he’ll move forward with the patenting process.

As a rising senior at Fort Pierce Central High School Sansone has dreams of attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His winnings from ISEF will go toward college tuition.

Sansone says he hadn’t originally planned to enter into the competition. But when he learned that one of his classes allowed him to complete a year-long research project and paper on a topic of his choice he decided to take the opportunity to continue working on his motor.

“I was thinking if I'm able to put this much energy into it I might as well make it a science fair project and compete with it” he explains. After doing well at the district and state competitions he advanced to ISEF.

Sansone is waiting until his next phase of testing before he approaches any car companies but he hopes that one day his motor will be the design of choice for electric vehicles.

“Rare-earth materials in existing electric motors are a major factor undermining the sustainability of electric vehicles” he says. “Seeing the day when EVs are fully sustainable due to the help of my novel motor design would be a dream come true.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi8wFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMi8wOC8xMC8yNDk1NTM5LzI4MTI0L2VuL0NoaW5hLUFmbGliZXJjZXB0LU1hcmtldC1JbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9uLVJlcG9ydC0yMDIyLVJlZ2VuZXJvbi1oYXMtRXhjbHVzaXZlLVNhbGVzLVJpZ2h0cy1pbi10aGUtVS1TLU1hcmtldC13aGlsZS1CYXllci1PYnRhaW5zLUV4Y2x1c2l2ZS1TYWxlcy1SaWdodHMtT3V0c2lkZS10aGUtVS1TLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China Aflibercept Market Investigation Report 2022: Regeneron has Exclusive Sales Rights in the U.S. Market while ...,"Dublin Aug. 10 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Investigation Report on China's Aflibercept Market 2022-2031"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.



Aflibercept is an anti-VEGF drug mainly used to treat neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) and other retinopathy caused by visual impairment. Aflibercept was jointly developed by Regeneron and Bayer. Regeneron has exclusive sales rights in the U.S. market while Bayer obtains exclusive sales rights outside the U.S. Their Aflibercept EYLEA was launched in China in 2018. By July 2022 Bayer AG is the only manufacturer in the Chinese Aflibercept market.



According to this market research after Aflibercept entered the Chinese market the sales value of Aflibercept in China increased from CNY8.3 million in 2018 to CNY238 million in 2021. The annual growth rate in 2021 was 116% which slowed down due to the COVID-19 epidemic. The CAGR of sales value of aflibercept in China is 206% from 2018 to 2021.



The analyst analyzes that as the epidemic situation has been improved and the hospitals resume their operation the sales of Aflibercept will have a recovery growth from 2023 to 2026. In addition the sales will also increase due to market expansion. Currently China has only approved two indications for Aflibercept including treatment of wAMD and treatment of DME.

However Aflibercept had five approved indications globally which means the sales will continue to grow as the number of indications expands. On the other hand though the anti-VEGF ophthalmic drug market where Aflibercept belongs to accounts for the largest market share in the ophthalmology drug industry the penetration rate for the anti-VEGF drug is still low.

The penetration rate for the anti-VEGF drug is about 1% in China while it exceeds 5% in the U.S. Since the market demand has not yet reached saturation the sales will keep increasing. Besides Aflibercept was included in the national medical insurance catalog at the beginning of 2020 so the price has been lowered which reduces the burden on patients and will stimulate sales in the future.



Qilu Pharmaceutical a local Chinese pharmaceutical company received CDE (CENTER FOR DRUG EVALUATION NMPA) approval for its marketing authorization application for aflibercept intravitreal injection in April 2022 which is the first biosimilar application for aflibercept in China.



According to this market research a number of other pharmaceutical companies in China are in the process of genericizing aflibercept such as Clover Biopharmaceuticals' aflibercept intraocular injection which is in the clinical phase of application and Shandong Boan Biotechnology Co.



It is expected that the generic version of aflibercept will enter the Chinese market in the next five years but it is unlikely to have a significant impact on Bayer's original drug in the short term.

And pioneering pharmaceutical companies working on this technology now have neurodegenerative diseases in their sights.

Neurodegenerative diseases — such as Alzheimer’s Parkinson’s and Huntington’s — are common and most lack disease-modifying therapies or cures.

At least 1 in 14 of the UK population aged over 65 years has dementia with 60–70% of those cases classed as Alzheimer’s disease​[12]​. Data also show that 1 in 37 people in the UK will be diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in their lifetime and 1 in 10000 will develop Huntington’s disease​[34]​.

In December 2021 Ionis Pharmaceuticals based in Carlsbad California in partnership with Biogen based in Cambridge Massachusetts published data from the first trial of a gene-silencing drug — BIIB080 — for mild Alzheimer’s disease showing it to reduce key Alzheimer’s biomarkers and cause no serious adverse events​[5]​.

However the publication of the Ionis trial came on the heels of two high-profile gene-silencing drug failures for Huntington’s disease leaving those affected by the condition despondent. Understanding these failures may go some way to improving the next generation of gene-silencing drugs.

“There are molecules that are in the wings that are longer lasting safer and more potent” says chemist Jonathan Watts associate professor at the RNA Therapeutics Institute at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.

How do they work?

Gene-silencing therapies act to stop the translation of mRNA providing a method to remove the harmful proteins formed from mutated genes that can lead to disease. The most established method uses antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) — short synthetic single strands of DNA and RNA able to knock down genetic expression through base-pairing with their corresponding ‘sense’ strands of mRNA before they can be translated into proteins (see Figure).

Figure: Mechanisms of gene silencing

RNase H: Ribonuclease H; RNAi: RNA interference; siRNA: small interfering RNA; RISC: RNA-induced silencing complex

Since 2017 ASOs to treat spinal muscular atrophy (nusinersen [Spinraza; Ionis Pharmaceuticals]) and Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy (casimersen [Amondys 45; Sarepta Therapeutics]) have led the way. Part of the attraction is the simplicity of designing high affinity drugs this way.

“Everybody can match As with Us and Cs with Ts” jokes Watts.

ASOs can simply block access to the RNA base sequence to stop translation but a new generation of ASOs known as Gapmers are exploiting another mechanism. They are made up of short DNA sequences with RNA-like segments on each side to provide higher affinity to the target plus resistance to degradation by nucleases. When they bind to mRNA transcripts they are able to recruit an enzyme called Ribonuclease H which will trigger the RNA’s destruction (see Figure).

Ionis Pharmaceuticals Alzheimer’s ASO BIIB080 was designed to lower levels of tau protein which when misfolded is thought to cause the neurofibrillary plaques found in patients’ brains. In the phase I trial launched in 2017 it was administered intrathecally to 44 patients aged 50–74 years with mild Alzheimer’s disease over three months and showed an ability to reduce tau and associated protein markers in the cerebrospinal fluid by 30–50%​[5]​.

The impact on cognition will not be clear until results of the phase II trial which is set to start in summer 2022 with an estimated completion date of December 2026​[6]​.

Ionis is also developing an ASO drug for Parkinson’s disease — ION464 — designed to prevent the production of the alpha-synuclein protein known to accumulate in the brains of people with the condition and has licensed another — tofersen for a rare genetic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) called superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) ALS — to Biogen.

In July 2022 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new drug application and accelerated approval pathway for tofersen despite the drug failing to meet the primary end point in a phase III trial in 2021​[7]​. Integrated 12-month data from two trials included in the FDA filing suggest that individuals who start tofersen earlier experience a slower rate of decline.

Past failures

The promise of this gene-silencing approach has been tempered by the failures of two ASO drugs to treat Huntington’s disease — a rare genetic condition that causes the progressive degeneration of nerve cells in the brain.

One drug manufactured by Massachusetts-based Wave Life Sciences was designed to target the mutant Huntington’s gene (HTT) by recognising a single nucleotide polymorphism (an approach that only works in a subset of patients). However in an early phase Ib/IIa trial the drug failed to significantly lower levels of the mutant protein in the cerebrospinal fluid​[8]​.

Roche’s ASO tominersen (licensed from Ionis Pharmaceuticals in 2017) was designed to reduce both the mutant and healthy versions of the protein but even though a previous phase I/II trial did show lower levels of the protein in treated patients it failed in its phase III trial of 800 patients in 2021 producing worse outcomes with five cases of hydrocephalus — a build-up of fluid on the brain — in patients receiving the highest dosages of 120mg​[910]​.

Does this indicate a fundamental failure with the approach? “The answers are a definitive no” says Edward Wild professor of neurology and consultant neurologist at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery Queen Square and associate director of University College London’s Huntington’s Disease Centre who was involved in the tominersen trial.

What both failures show in different ways is how difficult it is to successfully deliver ASOs to the brain. Wild says Wave Life Sciences’ drug failed to engage the target. “That’s really a question of going back to the chemistry of the ASOs and making them better.”

Tominersen however did reach its target but the high doses given to facilitate delivery deep into the basal ganglia caused toxicity triggering an inflammatory response in the brain.

I think the doses that were chosen were too high; in retrospect we would do it differently Edward Wild a consultant neurologist and associate director of University College London’s Huntington’s Disease Centre

“I think the doses that were chosen were too high” says Wild. “In retrospect we would do it differently.”

In subsequent analysis Roche found that those patients at an earlier stage of the disease or who were younger did better than the group as a whole suggesting they were more able to tolerate the high ASO doses and gain a benefit​[11]​. As a result Roche plans to repeat a dose-ranging trial in this patient sub-group to try and test that hypothesis.

The failed drugs were based on chemistry developed in the 1980s and according to Matthew Wood professor of neuroscience in the Department of Paediatrics at the University of Oxford “there are many new chemical improvements that have come along in the past decade”.

Delivery dilemmas

The brain is protected by the blood–brain barrier that prevents entry to most molecules. For this reason current ASOs are injected directly into the spinal fluid which provides better access to the brain but makes frequent administration difficult.

A second generation of ASOs include chemical modifications with the non-bridging oxygens of the oligonucleotide phosphate backbone replaced with sulphur atoms (known as phosphorothioate modification). This improves their ability to resist attack by nucleases and also enhances protein binding and cell uptake properties as well as overall bioavailability. So although these drugs will still need to be administered intrathecally a lower dose is likely to be effective providing an improved therapeutic window.

The other approach to gene silencing takes advantage of RNA interference one of the cells’ natural defenses against viral RNA to prevent it being translated into proteins. It works using a multi-protein assembly called RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) which is able to break down double-stranded RNA to prevent translation. The complex loads one of the strands of an RNA molecule (the anti-sense strand) and here it acts as a template. Any complementary RNA transcripts in the cell will be destroyed before a protein can be formed from them (see Figure).

This can be exploited therapeutically if small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules are delivered to cells. Here they will automatically be loaded into RISC and the anti-sense strand will stay there bound for months continuing to remove any complementary mRNA produced by the cell. This means continued dosing is not needed but getting the siRNA into the cell in the first place is even more difficult than for an ASO owing to its larger size and its negatively charged surface.

“If you inject a single stranded ASO into the bloodstream it is taken up pretty effectively … but a duplex RNA something that’s fully double stranded does not show much cell uptake” explains Watts.

siRNAs are probably of the order of somewhere between one and ten-fold more potent than an ASO system in theory Matthew Wood professor of neuroscience in the Department of Paediatrics at the University of Oxford

siRNA’s ability to silence a gene is much greater though “probably of the order of somewhere between one and ten-fold more potent than an ASO system in theory” says Wood so there is a strong incentive to develop better delivery mechanisms.

“In practice resolving the chemistry and optimising the delivery has just taken longer to achieve [than for ASOs].”

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals has pioneered the siRNA approach and in 2021 it submitted a clinical trial application in collaboration with Regeneron Pharma to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency for a phase I study of ALN-APP an siRNA to treat early-onset Alzheimer’s disease by silencing the amyloid precursor protein (APP). The siRNA is designed to be delivered intrathecally in a single dose.

This will be Alnylam’s first siRNA programme using its new C16 conjugation technology to improve delivery to the brain. In addition to several modifications to the oligonucleotide backbone the siRNA molecule is conjugated to a hexadecyl group. Exactly how this improves uptake in the brain is still being investigated.

“We hypothesise that it promotes moderate affinity interactions with the extracellular matrix and various cell membrane components thus allowing for binding and uptake into various cell types within the brain as well as the lung and the eye” explains Vasant Jadhav head of the RNAi Platform at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals.

The company based in Cambridge Massachusetts intends to use its promising siRNA approach to treat other neurodegenerative diseases.

There are a number of genetically defined neurodegenerative diseases where there is significant potential for CNS-targeted RNAi therapeutics to have an impact Vasant Jadhav head of the RNAi Platform at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals

“We have development candidates that are undergoing preclinical evaluation for the potential treatment of Huntington’s disease and ALS in collaboration with Regeneron. We certainly feel that there are a number of genetically defined neurodegenerative diseases where there is significant potential for CNS-targeted RNAi therapeutics to have an impact” says Jadhav.

Third-generation drugs

Now a third generation of gene-silencing drugs for delivery to the CNS are making their way to the clinic. A novel design comes from the research of Anastasia Khvorov at the University of Massachusetts and is now being developed through start-up company Atalanta Therapeutics also based in Massachusetts. They are developing a new chemically modified siRNA architecture called divalent siRNA (di-siRNA) which is made up of two parallel modified oligonucleotides linked together​[12]​.

di-siRNA may be an improvement over both ASO and over ordinary siRNA in terms of distribution durability and tolerability Alicia Secor chief executive of Atalanta Therapeutics

So far according to Alicia Secor chief executive of Atalanta Therapeutics their performance “suggests that di-siRNA may be an improvement over both ASO and over ordinary siRNA in terms of distribution durability and tolerability”.

Atalanta is collaborating with Biogen on an HTT-targeting treatment for Huntington’s disease and with Genentech based in San Francisco California to develop di-siRNA therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases including targets associated with Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s plus developing its own pipeline.

Another ‘third-generation’ approach comes from start-up Ceptur Therapeutics based in New Jersey which has attached U1 adapters to siRNA molecules. These short single strands of artificial RNA bind to the protein U1 snRNP — part of the machinery that modifies RNA molecules inside the nucleus after they are made. In this case the adapters prevent the addition of the polyA tail stretch of the mRNA molecule which is needed for translation — without it the nascent RNA is degraded. Ceptur recently completed a US$75m financing round to continue developing its therapeutic for Huntington’s disease.

Gene-silencing therapies based on siRNA are also now being delivered as gene therapies using an adeno-associated viral vector to deliver the gene that makes the therapeutic RNA molecule.

Dutch biotech company uniQure biopharma is working on this approach to treat Huntington’s disease with its gene therapy candidate AMT-130. The therapy delivers the gene directly to the caudate and putamen — two deep brain structures that are affected in people with Huntington’s disease where information is processed. This will then continually produce the engineered RNA molecule which will bind any mutated HTT protein and mark it for destruction. The procedure is done by catheter guided by MRI. The first two patients in Europe have been dosed in uniQure’s phase I/II clinical trial which is underway in Poland and is currently expanding to the UK​[13]​. “It’s a pretty invasive approach high risk [but] high reward” says Wild who is part of the University College London and Cardiff clinical trials team.

Future goals

Ultimately the ambition of many of those developing drugs for neurodegenerative conditions is to be able to edit the faulty genes causing the disease. Wood is confident that we will have the ability to do this in time. “I have absolutely no doubt this approach is going to work” he says.

The current CRISPR technologies for gene editing are in their infancy and there are concerns about the accuracy of the editing process but according to Watt other base editing technologies that may be safer are coming down the pipeline towards readiness for clinical studies.

For now there are still hurdles in the development of gene-silencing drugs particularly for neurodegenerative conditions. One concern is improving the design of clinical trials and how patients are recruited says Wood. “It’s really hard to take patients in whom the disease has progressed in whom there’s an inflammatory environment in the brain and expect a positive result.”

He suggests trials should concentrate on treating groups at an earlier stage who have a better chance of responding to drugs. Also important is better markers to measure disease progression and trial success.

What is it you actually measure in the patients that tells you that drug is working for something like Alzheimer’s? Matthew Wood professor of neuroscience in the Department of Paediatrics at the University of Oxford

“What is it you actually measure in the patients that tells you that drug is working for something like Alzheimer’s? That’s quite tough” says Wood whose team is trying to develop more sensitive cognitive and memory tests so that it will be simpler to assess the next generation of gene-silencing drugs on their way.

Of course it is important to remember that even if the gene-silencing drugs are able to reach targets deep in the brain “if the target is wrong we will still fail’” says Watts.

While Huntington’s disease can be linked to a single gene the situation is less simple for Alzheimer’s disease. A number of recent failures of drugs that target amyloid plaques including crenezumab in June 2022 developed by Genentech and Swiss biotech company AC Immune have led to questions about this approach. As delivery technology improves gene-silencing drugs may ultimately help provide an answer.

“It becomes easier to cleanly address the questions of disease hypothesis [and discover] what [we] can silence that will help a patient” says Watts."

The Asian Development Bank's primary mission is to ""foster economic growth and cooperation"" among countries in the Asia-Pacific Region. Founded in 1966 and based in Manila Philippines the ADB assists members and partners by providing loans technical assistance grants and equity investments to promote social and economic development.

The ADB has been responsible for major projects in the region and raises capital regularly through the international bond markets. The ADB also relies on member contributions retained earnings from lending and the repayment of loans for the funding of the organization.

Key Takeaways The Asian Development Bank's (ADB) primary mission is to promote economic growth and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region.

The majority of the ADB’s members are in the Asia-Pacific region.

The ADB provides assistance to its developing member countries in the region.

It also provides financing to certain private sector projects as well as public-private partnerships through grants loans technical assistance and equity investments to promote development.

The ADB is controlled by member countries with the U.S. and Japan having the largest stake.

How the Asian Development Bank Works

The Asian Development Bank provides assistance to its developing member countries the private sector and public-private partnerships through grants loans technical assistance and equity investments to promote development. The ADB regularly facilitates policy dialogues and provides advisory services. They also use co-financing operations that tap official commercial and export credit sources while providing assistance.

Membership in the ADB is open to members and associate members of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. It's also open to other regional countries and non-regional developed countries that are members of the U.N. or of any of its specialized agencies.

The ADB is one of two Asian regional development banks the other being the Chinese-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).

Financing Provided by the Asian Development bank

The ADB provides both private financing and sovereign (public) financing. Private sector efforts focus on projects that help promote private investments in the region that will have significant development impact and will lead to accelerated sustainable and inclusive growth. Public-sector financing provides funding for member countries with flexibility in determining how they can achieve development goals.

In 2021 the ADB committed nearly US$13.5 billion to help its developing member countries address the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis and address vaccination needs and has mobilized a further $12.9 billion in co-financing from partners. Through a $9 billion Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility or APVAX announced in December 2020 the ADB provided funding for vaccine procurement logistics and distribution.

The total private financing portfolio consisted of $14.2 billion at the end of 2021. In terms of sovereign financing ADB's portfolio stood at $104 billion by the end of 2021 consisting of 713 loans 392 grants 915 TA projects one guarantee and 1 equity investment.

Structure of the Asian Development Bank

According to ADB's website ""the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank known as the ADB Charter vests all the powers of the institution in the Board of Governors which in turn delegates some of these powers to the Board of Directors. The Board of Governors meets formally once a year during ADB's Annual Meeting."" The ADB's highest policy-making body is its Board of Governors which comprises one representative from each member.

The two largest shareholders of the Asian Development Bank are the United States and Japan. Although the majority of the Bank's members are from the Asia-Pacific region the industrialized nations are also well-represented. Regional development banks usually work in harmony with both the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank in their activities.

Asian Development Bank Country Relationships

When ADB was founded in 1966 it consisted of 31 members. Since then membership has grown to 68 members which is made up of 48 regional and 19 non-regional members.

The veteran investment professional and former Lehman Brothers senior executive will be taking over from Alfonso Garcia Mora who is now IFC’s regional VP for Europe Latin America and the Caribbean.

In a press statement released on Monday Horowitz was quoted as saying that climate would remain her top priority for the region as she assumes the new role.

“Asia is critical in determining whether the climate battle will be won or lost so IFC will continue to work with the private sector to catalyse finance in the region helping countries achieve their climate targets while pursuing broader development goals” she said.

IFC said that its commitments include US$1.2 billion to support climate projects across East Asia and the Pacific region. This includes funding for “innovative green and blue transactions” as well as for renewable energy and climate-smart urban infrastructure projects.

“The past financial year saw many firsts in the climate space including blue bond issuances to help address marine pollution and support countries’ climate goals. IFC’s first ever sustainability-linked bond was in Asia Pacific” said IFC regional director for East Asia and the Pacific Kim-See Lim.

In recent months IFC however has been mired in controversy for its problematic investment practices in the region. It is currently under probe for backing microlenders in Cambodia that have engaged in predatory debt collection practices including pressuring borrowers to sell their land as well as for financing at least 10 new coal-fired power plants in the Philippines from 2011 to 2019 hence violating its own environmental and social protection policies.

The IFC’s funds are pooled from governments all over the world and the IFC’s financing for East Asia and the Pacific include $2.34 billion in equity loans and bonds. Observers say that all eyes will be on Horowitz as she navigates the troubled waters that IFC is now in for its work in the region.

Horowitz said that she is excited to have the opportunity to work with the Asia Pacific team at IFC and looks forward to building on the region’s strong history of impactful private sector engagements.

“ Asia is critical in determining whether the climate battle will be won or lost. Ruth Horowitz vice president for the Asia and the Pacific IFC

Most recently Horowitz served as the vice president of IFC’s equity mobilisation division – IFC Asset Management Company (AMC). Prior to joining IFC the investment professional with over 30 years of experience in the finance sector worked for now defunct financial services firm Lehman Brothers.

Once launched those new regions will join Google’s 34 cloud regions currently in operation around the world—11 of which are located in Asia Pacific.

Asia Pacific has been proving itself to be one of the fastest-growing emerging cloud markets especially since the pandemic. Data by International Data Corporation (IDC) even suggests that total spending on cloud services in Asia Pacific (excluding Japan) is expected to reach US$282 billion by 2025. Considering the new cloud computing opportunities and service sales Google Cloud decided to strengthen its foothold in the region with the unveiling of three brand-new cloud regions in Malaysia Thailand as well as New Zealand.

The three new cloud regions mark the company’s first ones in each country with an aim to provide local customers with the infrastructure to empower their cloud services. The announcement came on the heels of six other regions that the cloud giant plans on opening including Berlin Dammam Doha Mexico Tel Aviv and Turin.

“The New Zealand cloud region will give Kiwi businesses the choice to keep their data onshore retain data sovereignty and drive their digital transformation efforts locally with speed security and scalability at the core” Google’s cloud arm said in a statement yesterday. When launched the region will bring high-performance low-latency services and products to local customers and will have three zones to help protect against service disruptions.

AIRASIA SUPER APP NOW FLIES WITH GOOGLE CLOUD

Even IDC’s Asia/Pacific research director for cloud services and software research Daphne Chung said “The new cloud region will help to address organizations’ increasing needs in the area of digital sovereignty and enable more opportunities for digital transformation and innovation in New Zealand. With this announcement Google Cloud is providing customers with more choices in accessing capabilities from local cloud regions while aiding their journeys to hybrid and multi-cloud environments.”

Google Cloud currently has a Dedicated Cloud Interconnect in Auckland to support New Zealand customers. The New Zealand cloud region will be Google Cloud’s third region in Australasia joining Sydney and Melbourne. Overall Google Cloud has 11 cloud regions already in operation in JAPAC. Worldwide it has 34 regions and 103 zones currently in operation.

For context Google’s cloud computing arm ranks third when it comes to market-share leader in cloud services trailing Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. As of the second quarter of this year AWS owns approximately 34% of the global cloud market share followed by Microsoft at 21% then Google at 10% according to IT market research firm Synergy Research Group. All three players are also the largest spenders on building new data centers with billions in investment each quarter.

For its second quarter for financial year 2022 Google Cloud brought in US$6.3 billion of revenue a 35% year-on-year increase compared to last year’s second quarter’s US$4.6 billion revenue. Speaking in the company’s earnings webcast CEO Sundar Pichai said he believes Google Cloud has a “substantial market opportunity here” because the market “still feels like early stages of this transformation.

However Google Cloud continues to face losses as it faces stiff competition from the likes of Microsoft AWS and Oracle. For the second quarter Google Cloud reported an operating loss of US$858 million likely driven by infrastructure investments."

Murfreesboro government will post legal documents on city website

Advocate seeks to reduce what's buried at landfill

City also opposes Middle Point Landfill's proposed 99-acre expansion

Middle Point Landfill should face a federal lawsuit accusing the owners of causing odor and water pollution Murfreesboro officials decided Wednesday.

Middle Point is located near Murfreesboro's northern boundary by the East Fork Stones River which is the source of drinking water for the city and much of Rutherford County.

The Murfreesboro City Council consulted with legal counsel before directing staff in a 7-0 vote to file the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Nashville against the landfill owners Republic Services a publicly traded corporation based in Phoenix. The lawsuit also will be against two of the company's local operations: BFI Waste Services of Tennessee LLC and Republic Services of Tennessee LLC.

Murfreesboro Mayor Shane McFarland spoke at a 1:15 p.m. press conference at the city's airport to discuss the landfill issues following the council meeting. He mentioned how the city has had over 2000 online complaints from residents about the landfill odors since September 2021

""These complaints were received after multiple public assurances from Republic a year ago that the odor problem would be gone"" the mayor said. ""Yet the problem persists.""

'Times have changed':How landfill decisions in 1987 1995 shaped Rutherford County today

Republic Services emailed the following statement to The Daily News Journal in response to the lawsuit:

""We are reviewing the complaint now. In the last 18 months Middle Point has invested more than $6 million in landfill infrastructure enhancements with additional investments planned or already underway. The community can be assured that Middle Point remains committed to being a safe and responsible landfill operator and good neighbor.""

The city also has opposed a proposed 99-acre expansion of Middle Point that's located on East Jefferson Pike (state Route 66) and off U.S. Highway 231 North (Lebanon Pike) in the Walter Hill community on the north side of Rutherford County.

Murfreesboro officials have estimated the existing 207-acre landfill will be full by July 2026. City officials have been examining alternative plans including waste-to-energy operations and hauling trash to another landfill outside Rutherford County.

Landfill fire concerns officials

The source of the Middle Point odor goes beyond the trash being dumped at the landfill the mayor said.

""Landfill-related odors are connected to the way a site is operated including how the gasses and millions of gallons of leachate (liquid) produced by the landfill are collected and managed"" McFarland said.

""Landfill gas emissions and leachate outbreaks at any landfill are a source of harsh odors like those described in hundreds of citizen complaints received by the city.""

Solid waste issues:How officials want to trim Middle Point Landfill dumping by 70%

The mayor noted there's documented evidence about Middle Point failing to contain gas emissions and leachate outbreaks.

""These problems are in addition to the massive uncovered trash piles at Middle Point that finally caught fire in (June)"" McFarland said.

Others including Rutherford County Mayor-elect Joe Carr have raised concerns about Middle Point operations. He shared on Facebook a video he recorded of the landfill being on fire in June.

""This is a serious matter"" said Carr a Republican who will be replacing Mayor Bill Ketron. ""You shouldn’t have a fire at a landfill. You don’t know what’s burning and you should not be releasing toxins into the air.""

Carr contends this fire should be viewed as more of a threat than a minor incident.

""If a fire at a landfill is no big deal then let’s set the whole damn thing on fire"" Carr said. ""Let’s burn the whole damn thing down.""

City has evidence of landfill water pollution at Walter Hill Dam

Mayor McFarland also mentioned that an outside consultant in February used a infrared camera to examine Middle Point Landfill and found plumes of noxious gases lofting out of both of the landfill's enclosed gas flares.

""Those plumes should and would not be there if the flare combustion system was working properly"" McFarland said.

The mayor also added that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in August 2021 had the same findings in a report as the consultant had in February of this year.

""The EPA noted that something may be wrong with the flare system because those conditions were not seen at other landfills"" said McFarland adding that the plumes of gas are a concern for the community.

""Depending on wind direction and thermal layers those gases travel and can make ground contact in homes and businesses.""

Middle Point Landfill:Why regional committee citizens continue to oppose expansion

In addition to the odor issues the lawsuit will provide water sample evidence of the landfill's leachate discharge contaminating the Stones River near the city's Walter Hill Recreation area.

The city also found similar landfill leachate evidence south of the Matthew's Lake area where a groundwater source flows to the East Fork Stones River the mayor said.

The water sample leachate evidence the mayor said also reveals a high level of a chemical known as PFAS which is polyfluoroalkyl substances according to the EPA website.

""PFAS chemicals are toxic but not absorbed through the skin"" McFarland said. ""The city nevertheless will be posting signs at Walter Hill Recreation Area advising people who are boating or swimming in the Stones River not to ingest the river water.""

Murfreesboro government will post legal documents on city website

In addition to the lawsuits the city will provide two written legal notices about the issues to the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation and the national EPA the mayor said.

One notice will inform the regulators about the landfill leachate discharges being in violation of the Federal Clean Water Act the mayor said.

The other notice will provide evidence of the landfill violating the Federal Clean Air Act McFarland added.

The notices are required by federal law in pursuing additional legal claims against Republic Services. The city will file additional lawsuit claims if Middle Point fails to resolve the issues within 60 days the mayor said.

McFarland also noted that the city's website will provide copies of the lawsuit and legal notices.

Advocate seeks to reduce what's buried at landfill

Murfreesboro Democrat Matt Ferry has been a long-time advocate of reducing the solid waste buried at Middle Point Landfill through recycling and composting. He's organized a ""Stop the Super Dump"" Facebook group to advocate against expansion of the landfill.

“We’re for better practices not for shutting down the landfill completely” Ferry said. “We are aware that if that happens (waste removal) fees would skyrocket and people will lose their minds. And honestly there are a lot of people who don’t have the money for another utility.”

Ferry is the Democratic nominee campaigning against state Rep. Bryan Terry R-Murfreesboro in the Nov. 8 election.

“We want a plan that cuts down on waste because that’s part of the problem” said Ferry who questions why Republic permits trash from 27 Middle Tennessee counties as of 2022 to be dumped at Middle Point. “That’s outrageous.”

The landfill also puts neighbors in greater risk of respiratory problems Ferry said.

“People in that area are at their wit’s end” said Ferry who praised the city's efforts to oppose the landfill.

“If we reduce the waste it will prolong the life of the landfill” Ferry said. “We definitely need more recycling and composting. We need to think about the landfill as a last resort. They want to put everything in the landfill but not everything belongs there.”

Over the past several weeks frustrated customers have fumed on social media about the Texas-based company’s apparent lack of customer service mandatory organic waste requirements (Senate Bill 1383) and new “flimsy” city-owned trash bins. Many were also confused and angry after reporting a 20% rate increase on their first bill from the waste hauler.

The Carlsbad City Council awarded Republic Services a 10-year $270 million waste contract in April 2021 to replace Waste Management the city’s previous waste removal company.

Michelle Trostler who lives in south Carlsbad said she expected a rate increase from Republic Services due to increases in labor fuel and other necessities. However Trostler has reported problems with the company’s customer service and difficulty accessing the autopay billing system among other issues.

Trostler said she’s tried for nearly two months to get a smaller recycling bin since her son left for college. She’s contacted the company at least four times put out the bins for them to collect and even tried waving down a passing employee — all to no avail.

“Some people are screaming about totally illegitimate things and others screaming about legitimate things” Trostler said. “I think the city could’ve communicated it 10 times and maybe that would’ve helped a little bit. But people just throw this kind of stuff away.”

And she’s not alone. Dozens if not hundreds of customers have described similar experiences with Republic Services including going weeks without trash bins difficulty reaching customer service representatives garbage trucks accidentally crushing bins wheels falling off trash receptacles and missing accounts in the company’s service “system.”

Additionally Republic Services has offered a free “kitchen caddy” to customers but Trostler and others have reported difficulties obtaining the complimentary bin after the company reportedly ran out of stock on the first day.

Ryan Egan who lives in Carlsbad Village said bugs flies maggots and other pests had overrun his organic waste bins.

Egan who expressed confusion and frustration over the state’s new organic waste law questioned why the company he’s paying couldn’t sort the trash and organic waste.

“I haven’t seen any benefit from what we had before” Egan said about the transition from Waste Management to Republic Services. “The green waste is the biggest challenge. I want to be better in helping the planet but it’s adding a lot of work for me when it should be on the company to sort that out.”

City Republic responses

In an email to The Coast News Republic Services said residential customers are billed once every two months while commercial and multi-family customers receive a monthly bill.

Jamie Wood the city’s environmental sustainability director and Avecita Jones sustainable materials management program director acknowledged the billing system is a change for customers in the Carlsbad Municipal Water District who for the last 10 years had received a packaged bill from Waste Management and the water district combining their water trash and wastewater services.

In response to complaints over the rate increase the city’s new contract with Republic features several new programs and service options — requested by residents — such as unlimited flattened cardboard and other recyclables outside the cart (recyclables placed inside a separate container). Wood said households also receive a California Redemption Value (CRV) for recycling bottles and cans.

For those who have not yet obtained a kitchen caddy a Republic spokesperson said they are available at the company’s Palomar Transfer Station at 5960 El Camino Real. The company will also hold three distribution events in the coming weeks and giveaway the bins at various events in the future.

“The optimal way to use the kitchen caddy is to line it with paper (such as newspaper paper bag or paper towels) layer in food scraps and then cover with another layer of paper” the company spokesperson wrote. “Do this until full and then take to your green bin outside. Some best places to store kitchen caddies include the refrigerator freezer or under the sink.”

For customers reporting abandoned Waste Management trash bins at their homes Jones said the city asked Republic to do route checks and collect the old containers through the company’s subcontractor.

The ownership of the bins is a bit complex. Republic paid for the new containers but the city owns them. Moving forward each container will be assigned to an address in perpetuity a best practice amongst other municipalities also known as “address “owning.”

Wood said there would be no swapping out bins if the city changed service providers in another 10 years.

“Now as part of the contract the bins will stay with the homeowner” Wood said. “We don’t have to do a full city changeover. We’re trying to keep it from happening again.”

Bins are colored blue gray and green as required by state law so residents can quickly identify the proper container for trash recycling and organic waste. The bins are 30% recycled plastic part of Republic Services’ effort to be more environmentally responsible. Republic will replace damaged carts at no cost to customers.

“We are confident the carts will hold up over time and continue to monitor and adjust the hydraulic arms our new fleet uses for collection” the company said. “If a cart is damaged customers can call customer service at 760-332-6464 to schedule an exchange.”

Residents can call 760-332-6464 to schedule exchanges if necessary. Most cart requests are resolved within three days.

“It (garbage can) sat out for a number of days before we got tired of waiting and took it back into the garage"" Kalamazoo resident Michael Parr said.



Previous Coverage:

Representatives with the city's vendor said they're experiencing delays due to a driver shortage.

""Although we will attempt to complete all service today please leave containers curbside for pickup tomorrow Thursday Aug. 11 if not completed today"" the company said in a message to residents impacted.

Parr said he doesn't mind the delays and understands the staffing shortage Republic Services is facing.

""For the most part Republic Services has been real reliable but earlier this summer we noticed sometimes the yard waste or the recycling might be a day or two late"" Parr said.

Republic Services delayed service on Aug. 4 saying ""we are currently exhausting all options to complete service by Saturday.""

Delayed Pickup:



A spokesperson for the city of Kalamazoo said when delays are expected they let impacted residents know. They said Republic is working to catch up on routes as soon as possible.

Most residents said they can deal with the delays as long as they are notified by phone or text and can prepare.

“One time in the middle of this issue they didn’t call and we’re left wondering. But now they’re putting people’s minds at rest it’s not my fault and they are going to get with it"" Parr said.



The city of Kalamazoo spent more than $450000 earlier this summer to have another company Santiago Services come in and help with bulk trash pickup when Republic Services fell behind.

The city of Murfreesboro is filing a federal lawsuit against the owners and operators of Middle Point landfill.

Murfreesboro Mayor Shane McFarland says it’s for several reasons including environmental concerns like gas odors and contaminated liquids.

“The sources of the odor are simply not trash at the landfill. Landfill-related odors are connected to the way a site is operated including how the gases and millions of gallons of leachate produced by the landfill are collected and managed” McFarland says.

He says in February an outside consultant used infrared lights and found gas flares. While laying out the highlights of the city’s case McFarland says landfill owners Republic Services confirmed the problems would be gone but weren’t.

The Middle Point landfill collects most of Middle Tennessee’s trash and it could fill up by 2027.

The local government and landfill owners including Republic Services have come to several dead ends trying to resolve the issue.

The owners want to add 99 adjacent acres. But the regional solid waste board has denied the expansion. The county and city mayor have been vocal opponents of the expansion as well.

Since launching an online portal almost a year ago Murfreesboro received more than 2000 complaints.

(WTVF) — Murfreesboro officials filed a federal suit against its landfill operators over concerns of water toxicity and mounting odor complaints from residents.

The 35-page complaint outlines the allegations against the owners of Middle Point Landfill in Rutherford County. Listed in the suit are BFI Waste Systems of Tennessee Republic Services of Tennessee and Republic Services.

Prior to the lawsuit an exclusive video obtained by NewsChannel 5 Investigates showed how gases escaped the Middle Point Landfill. Some said those gases were making the notorious odor that's plagued the landfill for years even worse. The footage shows the flare stacks meant to burn off this harmful gas that some said is hardly doing the job. There have now been more than 2000 odor complaints filed to the city. The owners told residents it was the city's sewer system rather than the landfill according to the suit.

In total the landfill expanded to 207 acres of fill space located inside a total 803-acre parcel with support facilities according to the suit. Earlier in 2021 the expansion of the landfill was voted down after pushback from neighbors and city leaders. In 2022 Rutherford County officials proposed no longer accepting any kind of waste to the landfill.

""The city has steadily and actively engaged to protect its interests and the interests of the residents of Murfreesboro and Rutherford County"" Murfreesboro Mayor Shane McFarland said. ""Months before the City obtained that footage the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency found the same thing in August of 2021. In its report the EPA noted that something may be wrong with the flare system because those conditions were not seen at other landfills. The plumes of gas revealed by infrared cameras do not magically disappear. Depending on wind direction and thermal layers those gases travel and can make ground contact and infiltrate homes and businesses.""

Additionally the lawsuit alleges water runoff has placed toxic chemicals in the East Fork Stones River and the Walter Hill Recreation Area. For year the landfill accepted all types of waste ranging from industrial and paint sludges soils with low radiation metal shavings asbestos and soils contaminated with petroleum and diesel waste.

""According to Republic they are not polluting the river"" McFarland said. ""The evidence says otherwise. Pollutants at both discharge locations contain a chemical fingerprint that closely matches the leachate from Middle Point. In addition to all of that there is yet another pollutant in both discharges that acts as a tracer connecting both discharges to Middle Point's landfill leachate.""

Middle Point Landfill issued the following statement about the lawsuit:

""We are reviewing the complaint now. In the last 18 months Middle Point has invested more than $6 million in landfill infrastructure enhancements with additional investments planned or already underway. The community can be assured that Middle Point remains committed to being a safe and responsible landfill operator and good neighbor.""

As a result of the lawsuit the city wants the landfill to do water testing ceases the discharge of toxic chemicals stop being a public nuisance and eventually pay for compensatory damages."

He is a machine that scores goals. If you look at his stats he guarantees goals and every team needs a player like that. With him Ansu Fati and Aubameyang we have that.” says Joan Laporta – FC Barcelona President.



Barcelona have been struggling to score goals since their top two gunmen Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez left the club. The Spanish giants have been trying to compensate for the departure of their stars by bringing in attackers but to no avail. Memphis Depay who finished as the club’s top scorer in La Liga last season with only 12 goals is the player with the least goals scored in La Liga for the Blaugranas this century since Ronaldinho and Saviola scored 14 goals each in the 03/04 La Liga season.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang showed glimpses of what an elite striker can do for Xavi’s Barça by scoring 13 goals in the second half of the season in all competitions. Perhaps the coach might have requested for another elite striker because of his tendency of missing chances and also some deficiencies in his gameplay

Barcelona signed the Polish striker for €45 million plus €5 million add-ons which will be difficult to gain as speculated. FC Barcelona now have in their corner a consummate model of a modern-day striker. 8 Bundesliga titles 1 UCL 1 UEFA Super Cup1 Club World cup 3 DFB- Pokal and many countless accolades Robert joins Barça as a very decorated and well-established player. The two-times FIFA World Best winner scored 344 goals in 375 appearances for the Bavarians which places him 2nd as the all-time top scorers of the club.

A lot of questions were raised about the player with regards to his age and the fee he was bought for. On and off the field the striker has a lot in his bag to offer Barcelona. The 33-year old joined Barça as the 4th oldest player to join the club (for the first time) since Julius Muller Hilario and Lilian Thuram.



With Anna the player’s wife drawing tailored diet plans for him and also acting as his personal trainer the player looks as fit as ever. Robert only missed 28 games through injury in his 8-year stint at Bayern Munich. He was the player to score the most goals (35) in all the top 5 leagues last season so age doesn’t really come to play here.



Robert Lewandowski’s playing style has led many to believe he is only good at scoring goals. But in reality he is a versatile striker. He is arguably the most lethal striker of this generation with speed great positioning technical skill and aerial strength. Lewandowski is the player with the most goals(344) scored in Europe’s top 5 leagues since he joined Bayern Munich 8 years ago followed by Messi ( 329) and Ronaldo ( 323).



He’s a striker who prefers stretching out the opposition’s defensive line instead of getting so much involved in build-up plays leading to him having 23.5 passes per game which is relatively low. He’s almost outperformed his xG in each season and also records a high shot-on-target percentage because he shoots more in the box than outside.





Barcelona midfielders control games by passing the ball around but were less efficient in final ball circulation. Xavi had to extend the passing zones by using his wide wingers because the midfield couldn’t create more chances through the central zones. Coincidentally most of the chances that lead to Lewandowski’s goals in the Bundesliga came from out wide as in-swings or sometimes cutbacks.

Due to low chance creation through the central zones by the midfielders Xavi had to deploy the use of the third man runs in or around their opponent’s box often. It was mostly Sergio Busquets exchanging passes between Pedri/De Jong/Gavi with Aubameyang moving his markers off their lines. One thing was always clear though they scored goals with that play- Aubameyang had a bad first touch.

He mostly distorted the play by misplacing passes or giving “safe ” passes. Once again this is where Lewandowski has an upper hand. Another prominent feature of the striker is his silky first touches and ball controls. He clearly showed that aspect of him in the Joan Gamper trophy against Pumas by passing the ball beautifully to Pedri with his back facing the goal.

Unlike Karim Benzema Lewandowski isn’t that creative but he managed to create more chances (6) than all Barça players apart from Ousmane Dembele Jordi Alba Gavi and Ferran Torres. One of his greatest assets is finding holes in the opposition’s defensive line and exploiting spaces which he in turn uses to beat offsides leaving him 1v1 with the keeper.

Lewandowski also has great heading abilities. He’s the player among the Barça forwards who had the highest percentage of aerial duels won. Barça and Cadiz were the teams with the most crosses made (577) in La Liga last season meaning Lewandowski will be served well if he wants the ball flying. Lewandowski at Bayern wasn’t so much involved in pressing but his positioning was key.

With teams that liked building from the back the player was tasked to block the passing lane between the centre-backs forcing them to pass out wide which in turn distorts the passing pattern of the team. This is the same duty Xavi tasks his centre-forwards to do which will make it easy for Lewandowski to settle in the team. Robert is also the guy who can step to take penalties for Barça. He has a magnificent conversion rate of 90.8% by taking 65 penalties and scoring 59 in his senior career.





“Besides scoring goals I hope to be able to help the team in terms of my winning mentality” says the Polish striker. As a top and instinctive goalscorer he offers the club a figure to build the team around. Xavi’s new team has a lot of young players who are not known serial winners and would need a player with such mentality and abilities leading them up front.





Barcelona fans will be quick to tell you their recent performances in the UCL would’ve been better if their former gunman Luis Suarez was scoring to complement Lionel Messi. Suarez who is considered by most as the best striker of his generation Suarez went six years straight without scoring an away goal in the UCL which had a toe on the team in the competition and has racked up 31 Champions League goals in total before returning to South America this summer and joining Nacional.



Barcelona has bought a player who has 86 goals 25 assists in 106 appearances in the UCL . The 33-year old has some amazingly terrific records in the UCL which it’s likely he will do same or at least few of them for Xavi’s Barça. He is:



• The player who has scored the fastest hattrick in UCL history ( 23 minutes against RB Salzburg)

• The only player with most consecutive wins in UCL history ( 22 games)

• The player with the quickest succession of goals scored in UCL knockout history. ( 2 of his goals against RB Salzburg with 80 seconds apart)

• The only player in UCL to score in 9+ consecutive appearances twice.

• One of the two players ( with Messi) to score 4+ goals in the UCL on two different occasions.

• The player with the highest goal per match ratio (0.81) in UCL history amongst players with 25+ goals .







Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Robert Lewandowski’s Barcelona move: “Difficult to respond to that question. I am an Atletico [Madrid] fan but I am also President of the Government of Spain. I will say it is a great signing that Barcelona have made.”





With Barça’s financial situation now it was a brave and risky investment especially for a player that’ll turn 34 soon. Bayern Munich made the most jerseys sales in 2021 with 3.25 million jerseys sold. Lewandowski alone was responsible for 29.8% of Bayern jersey sales by selling over 970000 jerseys.

He followed Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as the players with the most jerseys sales in 2021 by selling 1.2 million and 1.05 million respectively. Robert is a player with a huge commercial pull which can improve Barça’s image and also La Liga as a whole.





Barça last season was the second team that had the biggest chances created (107) and big chances missed ( 62) – the arrival of the Polish might solve a lot of their problems upfront. Lewandowski is capable of leading this new wave at FC Barcelona and if everything goes as planned it can spark a title-winning standard for Xavi’s Barcelona.

As such the approach presents as much of an organizational and cultural challenge as a technical one. But what are the structures methodologies and tools that give enterprises the best chance to make digital transformation an enduring philosophy rather than a quickly abandoned management fad?

Interviews with CIOs and IT leaders point to several emerging tactics. Among them are communities of practice an agility initiative -- typically involving cross-functional teams -- and platform thinking. These tools are proving useful for managing the sweeping changes that affect how employees perform their jobs develop products and interact with customers during a large transformation effort. But they are not always easy to implement and face the same risk of failure as the ambitious technology initiatives of previous eras.

""A lot of [employees] have experienced the big program at a company that didn't go well"" said Ryan Gilmour managing director at Slalom Consulting a firm that advises companies on strategy technology and business transformation. ""They remember the pain and angst. Can you get people to embrace not just the notion of change but how they deal with it?""

Companies find these digital transformation tools and methods can advance initiatives.

Creating communities of practice mitigates turf warfare scales projects Getting people to buy into change isn't simple; neither is scaling digital transformation beyond isolated successes. Both jobs call for corporate-level involvement to shine a light on transformation wins encourage deployment elsewhere in the business and provide guidance. But too much of a top-down approach can rankle local leaders in highly distributed companies. Some organizations are turning to communities of practice sometimes called communities of support to advance digital transformation while avoiding turf warfare. Such communities bring people together to work on common challenges and share best practices. Chris Nardecchia senior vice president of IT and CIO at Rockwell Automation said he's found the community of support model works best for including local participation in corporatewide initiatives. The community of support creates a centralized structure that provides resources for local implementations to use as needed. Those resources include assistance with investment planning and prioritization as well as a standard method for managing digital transformation rollouts. The idea is to give local implementation teams the backing they need to launch projects they will eventually manage on their own. ""You want them to feel part of the process and you need them to sustain it"" Nardeccia said. Resources also include technical experts who can be assigned to local initiatives. A community of support for example could supply data scientists to an implementation team that needs help with machine learning algorithms. ""It's powerful if you have a community of support to share resources across the enterprise and to get people working on common problems"" Nardecchia said. The centralized community also helps avoid duplication of effort he added. Can you get people to embrace not just the notion of change but how they deal with it? Ryan GilmourManaging director Slalom Consulting

Rockwell Automation's approach to transferring knowledge Rockwell Automation has taken this approach with Microsoft Power Apps a product that lets organizations build applications and automate business processes with low- or no-code. The company's Power Apps community provides a central hub with people who know the ins and outs of the technology Nardecchia said. Local teams tap into this centralized community of support to get expertise they need. A plant in Europe for example may want to create an application to boost workgroup productivity but lack the Power Apps skills to do so. In that case local managers could pitch their idea to the community which would provide people to instruct them on Power Apps tools and techniques. The local group would then deploy maintain and operate the application. After gaining experience the group could end up offering their own expertise. ""They have the skills they can contribute to the community for the next person that has a need for something"" Nardecchia said. ""They become part of the larger community."" Over time a community becomes more self-sustaining and requires less executive engagement he added.

V2MOM as a rallying point for transformation Communities of practice are part of Phil Komarny's transformation strategy at Maryville University. Komarny the St. Louis school's chief innovation officer aims to replace the unwieldy business processes students currently use with modern applications such as Salesforce and Slack. He believes in creating a culture where people feel connected and encouraged to blend ideas for improving the student experience. ""It's not command-and-control time"" he said. ""We're basically creating communities of practice around the specific technologies and processes we need to run the business better."" Komarny also subscribes to the Vision Values Methods Obstacles and Measurements framework known as V2MOM. The framework which originated at Salesforce states the organization's vision and helps employees understand how their roles and objectives line up with that vision. Komarny was vice president of innovation at Salesforce before joining Maryville in November 2021. ""Making everything very visible and very aligned -- I think that's what it takes to drive this kind of change"" Komarny said. ""It's not being done to them. It's being done with them.""

Pursuing agility and building cross-functional teams As the pace of digital transformation accelerates agility has become a watchword among enterprises. Strategies around agility range from adopting formal Agile methodologies to devising lowercase agile approaches that aim to deliver results faster. Shifting customer purchasing patterns influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic have reinforced the need to achieve business agility in a rapidly changing world. Changing consumer behaviors have led Chase to ""embrace agile at a different scale"" said Rohan Amin the financial services company's chief product officer. Amin's purview includes the Chase Mobile app and Chase online. How Chase builds such products today marks a departure from previous efforts to build systems for delivering customer experience. ""In some cases experiences before had been built based on what we could do technically"" Amin said. ""This is just how our systems were architected."" Chase's revised approach is built around ""agile transformation"" which Amin described as a methodology that guides how the organization builds software. The emphasis is on creating software incrementally and in smaller batches to tackle specific issues and needs he added. This method of transformation also calls for cross-functional teams that include the business side of the enterprise. Chase's cross-functional partnership unites product design data and analytics and engineering personnel. This collaboration ""is about getting business folks a lot closer to the details of what's happening on the inside and what our engineers are building"" Amin said. The upshot is clear accountability rapid decision-making and the ability to build software at scale he noted. Slalom's Gilmour cited velocity as one way organizations measure digital transformational success. He said he works with clients that operate in a small-and-nimble startup mindset and large enterprises that have adopted scaled frameworks. The latter include the Scaled Agile Framework and Large Scale Scrum both of which aim to implement Agile processes across multiple development teams. Some organizations eschew Agile in favor of homegrown methods. Joseph Thomas CIO at PenFed a nationwide credit union headquartered in McLean Va. said he doesn't talk Agile or Lean Agile. Instead PenFed's IT department uses an 8-8-8 approach for achieving business agility and providing software features quickly. ""We deliver within eight hours eight days or eight weeks"" he explained. ""And I work very much in partnership with the business"" to determine what can be done and what should be done. Getting business and technology on the same page is an objective Slalom also pursues. Gilmour said the consulting firm believes in a top-down/bottom-up approach that brings together a transformation management office executive-level sponsorship and grassroots efforts advocating for Agile processes. The transformation management office -- what some organizations might call a center of excellence -- takes responsibility for establishing standards and practices. This organization also communicates why the proposed digital transformation is happening. How it gets done however is left to the executive tier. ""The executive sponsorship has to decide how the organization is going to consume it"" Gilmour said. The leadership determines whether the rollout follows the Big Bang approach or takes an incremental path that introduces change on a division-by-division basis he noted. The grassroots component meanwhile gets a say in how areas such as software development will function in the transformed business.

Adopting a platform mentality Transforming enterprises have also adopted a platform approach although as with agile the term can mean different things within different companies. In some cases it can describe a technology stack that provides considerable capability on its own with room for future elaboration. Organizations can build upon and adapt a platform for an expanding number of use cases. Other characteristics include an ample partner ecosystem which provides additional features and no-code/low-code components that let business users create apps. Digital transformation with its growing demand for custom software has influenced the rise of citizen developers and sparked low-code adoption according to Gartner. Thomas cited the ability to use low-code/no-code technology to enable the business as part of PenFed's platform strategy which resides on Salesforce. ""This notion of application assembly is really going to be a trend going forward"" he said. PenFed began adopting Salesforce in 2018 as an alternative to specialty SaaS applications geared to smaller credit unions and large-scale custom development. The credit union also benefits from the Salesforce partner ecosystem having deployed UiPath for robotic process automation and Ping Identity for two-factor authentication. Platform thinking follows PenFed's take on the 80/20 rule: ""Eighty percent of the value comes from the Salesforce Platform ecosystem low-code/no-code and reusable components which allows delivery in 20% of the time"" Thomas said. California State Polytechnic University Pomona meanwhile is also building its digital future on a cloud-based technology platform offered by ServiceNow. The deployment began with managing IT help desk tickets and expanded to include the financial aid office and other employee workflows. The current phase of the rollout brings the platform to the student population. Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and Company however takes a different tack on platforms. The company has created centralized platforms for technologies such as natural language processing and forecasting. The platforms consist of algorithms and pre-built services that provide the foundation for building applications said Vipin Gopal chief data and analytics officer at Eli Lilly and Company. The forecasting platform for instance includes a core algorithm for addressing sales forecasting supply chain forecasting or other needs as they emerge. ""That is a fundamental principal that we use -- a platform-based approach to rapidly develop and deploy solutions for core areas that cut across the enterprise"" Gopal said."

We may receive a commission on purchases made from links.

The best storylines in wrestling are the ones that blur the line between reality and fiction. It's when the audience doesn't know if the animosity in the ring is as a result of terrific acting or because the performers actually want to tear each other's throats out. Then there are the cases when wrestlers might not even have a rivalry on screen but absolutely loathe each other backstage like regular co-workers.

Due to many wrestlers still believing in the principles of kayfabe a lot of real-life grudges don't always get spoken about or addressed. After all they want the audiences to still maintain the belief that what they're watching is real so there's no need to demystify it by revealing secrets. Yet like that annoying co-worker who insists on whistling MJF's theme song before every single meeting there will be a breaking point and the hate will flow in the kind of way that delights Emperor Palpatine.

Tropical Smoothie Cafe and European Wax Center,"Reading Time: 3 minutes

A new building has been going up in Glassboro immediately behind the new Chase Bank on Delsea Drive. The two new tenants are listed as Tropical Smoothie Cafe and European Wax Center.

I covered them in my May post which featured the new Five Below that is being developed but with the new shared building construction really taking shape I’ve had additional questions on it

I first learned of these two stores from the website of property owner Brixmor.

I’ve said this before but the Brixmor team has really done an amazing job with reimagining this shopping center. If there are awards to be given for this type of rebirth Brixmor should win something!

We’ll have more on Five Below opening very soon!

Collegetown Shopping Center in Glassboro soon completes their metamorphosis! In the distance are a new Five Below and further down is the reimagined K-Mart with LIDL Big Lots and Ross!

Once Five Below Tropical Smoothie Cafe and European Wax Center open up I believe Brixmor has caught up with their know signed tenants. They do show one front store space still available for lease (next to Five Below) and another uniquely placed store behind Ross.

Most of my commentary below is mostly from my May post.

Tropical Smoothie Cafe

Tropical Smoothie Cafe seems very eager to open up in Glassboro as at the job site they have several banners hanging from the construction fencing surrounding the new building.

As the name indicates they absolutely offer a large variety of smoothies; from dessert style to nutrition based.

Their menu shows 22 different varieties 3 more for kids and 16 supplements and add-ins

Tropical Smoothie Cafe is coming to Glassboro and they are excited to get open! Banners are in place go get customers excited for the new store!

But the thing you didn’t expect is that they also offer a FOOD!

A look at their online menu shows they have a fairly decent selection of handheld food items.

Flatbreads wraps quesadillas sandwiches salads and sides. Chicken Turkey Veggie…

In the core 42Freeway area they have a location in the Gloucester Town Center on Cross Keys Road and I have no idea how I missed posting on them when they opened.

In just the last few years they have signed (and opened)

European Wax Center

We posted on European Wax Center five years ago when they opened a location in Deptford near Hobby Lobby.

European Wax Center has over 850 locations and as you would expect based on the name… they feature “waxing” hair removal. Their website shows their services also include body and skincare products.

They have six locations in the Counties of Camden Gloucester and Burlington and Glassboro will make 7.

European Wax Center is coming to Glassboro! In this image hey will be in the left portion of the new construction!

Considering that Deptford store opening was 5 years ago and they are still expanding I think we can say the Wax Center is clearing ripping it up!

An article at NJ Biz from February states at the time they were hoping for a third quarter opening. I am not certain if that is the case.

The case began when Joe King owner of a store selling CBD derivatives sued the Catoosa County Sheriff's Office after the sheriff demanded that all stores in the county stop selling most CBD products.

Sheriff Gary Sisk said people were being adversely affected by the products and that many hemp derivatives were illegal. King argued that CBD derivatives are beneficial to his customers and not specifically outlawed.

Because of the ruling as of Tuesday afternoon CBD products were back on the shelves of the Shoppe the store King owns in Fort Oglethorpe. In a phone interview King said his is one of about 10 stores in the Fort Oglethorpe area that sell CBD products and there are several more in Ringgold and throughout the county.

In the ruling Catoosa County Superior Court Judge Brian House said it is clear there's a difference of interpretation regarding hemp derivatives' legality under Georgia law. The question is best resolved by Georgia legislators House said but his court would grant the request if one of the sides in the case asked to have the ruling addressed by a higher court.

Stores in all other counties in Northwest Georgia besides Catoosa sell CBD derivatives without legal challenge King said adding that they're purchased to help with pain insomnia and anxiety - though he doesn't claim to be a doctor or pharmacist.

""Unfortunately if we want change we're going to have to be the change ourselves"" King said. ""If he (Sisk) continues to fight it we will continue to fight it. We know our product helps.""

CBD gummies are still prohibited House ruled. King said he needs to talk with the community of people supporting his legal challenge before he decides to ask the court to allow sales of CBD gummies.

Hemp was legalized federally under the Farm Bill in 2018. Georgia legalized hemp and its derivatives in 2019.

A legal limit of 0.3% for tetrahydrocannabinol or THC was set for delta-9 a derivative of CBD but King argues delta-8 and other pain-fighting derivatives have no THC threshold limits because thresholds aren't specifically mentioned in the law.

Staff Photo by Olivia Ross / The Shoppe pictured on Aug. 1 2022 sued Catoosa County after being forced to take delta-8 products off the shelves.

Hemp is the same plant as cannabis but with far less THC which is the chemical that gets people high.

""The court feels that the Georgia legislators would have explicitly limited certain hemp products (along) with delta-8 if they wanted it to be unlawful which they did not"" House said in his ruling.

The ruling does not address the issue of packaging and marketing of CBD products House said and law enforcement officers ""are not prohibited"" from enforcing those laws.

In February Sisk sent letters to King and other CBD retailers warning them they might be prosecuted for selling illegal products. In that letter he said some CBD products sold in the county had illegally high levels of THC and labels that misrepresent their products' effect or THC levels.

Sisk was interviewed about the ruling Tuesday night on a local access cable channel called UCTV in North Georgia.

There are several other ongoing court cases regarding CBD Sisk said and he thinks the state and federal authorities need to get on the same page legally.

""It's really convoluted"" Sisk said.

(READ MORE: Elisha Millan tends a crop of complexities in the hemp trade)

Despite the ruling Sisk said stores are still responsible for the products sold - because he said some CBD product labels illegally misrepresent the product's effect citing a separate Georgia law that requires truth in labeling.

""We just told the stores that they're responsible for what they sell"" Sisk said.

Sisk said he'd like to see the General Assembly revisit the laws regarding hemp derivatives. Some CBD derivatives have been synthesized to have high levels of THC and are allowed to be sold legally in what he called a ""loophole"" in the law. Sisk said he'd like to see the law clarified by making the 0.3% THC standard ""across the board"" for all CBD derivatives - not just delta-9.

Carnival Cruise Line will no longer require unvaccinated guests to apply for an exemption in order to sail as of Sep. 6 according to a news release. That does not include voyages in Australia or trips that are 16 or more nights and the changes are subject to local restrictions.

Princess Cruises will also remove vaccination requirements on ""most voyages of less than 16 days so that anyone can cruise"" starting Sept. 6 according to a news release Friday. Princess currently requires unvaccinated guests to have a vaccine exemption before they can sail according to its website.

Similarly Royal Caribbean will welcome all travelers regardless of vaccination status as well on sailings from Los Angeles New Orleans Galveston Texas and Europe beginning Sept. 5 ""as long as testing requirements are met"" a spokesperson told USA TODAY via email Thursday.

""We are collaborating with local governments throughout the Caribbean to align on vaccination requirements for additional itineraries"" the spokesperson added.

Royal Caribbean currently requires guests 12 and older to show proof of vaccination before they can sail from North America according to its website.

When do cruise lines still require COVID tests? Here's what passengers should know.

Cruise ship crime:What to know if you're sexually assaulted on a cruise. Resources laws.

And starting on the same date Celebrity Cruises will welcome all passengers who follow testing rules on sailings from Los Angeles the United Kingdom and Europe – excluding Iceland – according to its website.

The changes come after Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. announced plans to adjust its COVID-19 rules as well allowing all passengers to embark.

Many cruise lines have rolled back testing rules

Royal Caribbean Group parent company of Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity also rolled back its testing requirements this month following the end of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's COVID-19 Program for Cruise Ships. The company requires vaccinated passengers to take a test only on sailings six nights or longer but testing is still required for unvaccinated passengers on all sailings.

Many other cruise line operators and brands made similar protocol changes including Carnival Cruise Line and MSC Cruises.

Is the cruise industry coming back? After more than 2 years under a COVID cloud the answer is yes.

First-time cruisers:3 things to know before stepping foot on the ship

When do cruise lines still require COVID-19 testing?

► Carnival Cruise Line will require testing for vaccinated passengers only on trips 16 nights or longer or where local rules mandate it such as on sailings to Canada and Bermuda starting on Sept. 6 according to a press release.

Passengers who are unvaccinated or do not show proof of vaccination will still need to ""present the results of a negative PCR or antigen test taken within three days of embarkation."" Those under 5 years old are exempt from vaccine and testing requirements in the U.S.

► Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. will drop all pre-cruise requirements for vaccinated passengers ages 12 and over as of Sept. 3 according to a news release.

Guests ages 12 and older who are unvaccinated or do not show proof of vaccination will still need to test within 72 hours before boarding. The company said it ""continues to strongly recommend all guests be up to date on vaccination protocols and test at their convenience prior to travel."" Changes are subject to local requirements.

► On sailings from the U.S. MSC Cruises requires tests for fully vaccinated passengers sailing on trips six nights or longer and for all unvaccinated passengers age 2 or older regardless of trip length according to a press release. Tests must be taken within three days of embarkation. The cruise line recommends guests test within one day of the trip when possible.

► Princess Cruises will require passengers sailing on trips 16 nights or longer to ""take a supervised test within three days of embarkation (guests 5 and older)"" starting Sept. 6 as well as those on full Panama Canal transits and certain other voyages.

Unvaccinated passengers must show a negative result from a self-test taken within three days of their trip on sailings 15 nights or less though unvaccinated children under 5 are exempt.

► Holland America Line requires all guests age 2 and older to test before their trip. All guests 12 and up must be vaccinated according to the cruise line's website. Passengers ages 5 and 11 can also be unvaccinated but will need an exemption.

Guests who are up to date on their vaccines and have received a booster when eligible can test within three days before sailing. If they are vaccinated but not up to date they will need to test within two days.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9jcnVpc2UtbGluZS1zdG9ja3Mtb25ib2FyZC1wZXJrcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Do you own cruise line stocks? You could get onboard perks,"Many cruise fans choose to invest in cruise line stocks either because they want to support their favorite brand or because they view it as a financially savvy investment. But did you know that owning shares in a cruise company could give you onboard perks each time you cruise?

The major U.S. publicly traded cruise companies Carnival Corporation (which trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CCL) Royal Caribbean Group (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) all offer onboard credits ranging from $50 to $250 for those who own 100 shares or more of their stock.

Stock prices and any money you may or may not make from the investment are unpredictable. What is predictable are the perks. A small investment in a cruise company may pay off in more ways than you think especially if you are a frequent cruiser.

This is not advice about making a financial investment. Before buying any cruise stocks you should talk to your own adviser or broker and do your own research. Any financial investment is at your own risk.

Each cruise company has its own rules and nuances regarding the benefits of owning cruise line stocks. Here's how shareholder perks play out at the top three publicly traded cruise companies.

Carnival Corporation

Carnival Corporation is the parent company of cruise brands including Carnival Cruise Line Princess Cruises Holland America Cunard and luxury line Seabourn. If you hold a minimum of 100 shares of Carnival Corporation stock you'll receive an onboard credit of $250 per cabin for cruises of 14 days or longer $100 for cruises of seven to 13 days and $50 for cruises of six days or fewer. (Note that by ""days"" Carnival means nights on board.)

The current benefit is available on sailings through July 31 2023; reservations must be made by Feb. 28 2023.

You can use the credit for drinks gift shop purchases spa treatments or other onboard expenditures. You can't use the credit in the casino for gratuities or to get cash. The credit applies only to the shareholder-occupied stateroom; you won't get additional credits if you book multiple cabins.

To receive the credit first book your cruise vacation then send the specific cruise line an email fax or mailed letter with your legal name reservation/booking number ship and sailing date. You'll also need to provide proof — such as a copy of your proxy card or a dividend tax voucher — that you own 100 or more shares of stock.

The request needs to be made no later than four weeks before your sail date.

You'll find emails and addresses for each Carnival Corporation brand and specific rules on the company's website. For Carnival Cruise Line the email is shareholders@carnival.com the fax number is 305-406-6102 and the address is Guest Administration 3655 N.W. 87th Avenue Miami FL 33178.

Royal Caribbean Group

Royal Caribbean's shareholder perk applies to cruises on Royal Caribbean and Celebrity Cruises with the exclusion of any charter cruises (such as full-ship theme cruises) and Celebrity's Galapagos sailings.

Any shareholder with a minimum of 100 shares at the time of sailing is eligible for an onboard credit of $250 per stateroom for sailings of 14 or more nights $100 on sailings of six to 13 nights and $50 on sailings of five or fewer nights.

You may request the nontransferable credit each time you cruise. The credit applies only to the stateroom where the shareholder is staying and is based on double occupancy. If shares are held jointly and you are booking more than one stateroom 100 shares are required for each stateroom (based on one credit per shareholder per sailing and double occupancy). Single guests would have to pay 200% of the fare to receive the offer.

The credit can't be used for gratuities (service charges). It also doesn't apply to any activities you pay for prior to setting sail (such as prebooked shore excursions or spa treatments). It's credited to your shipboard account at the time of sailing.

Royal Caribbean suggests you request onboard credit two to three weeks prior to your sail date. The response from the cruise company should come within seven days.

You may make the request using the company's online form. For FAQs about the program visit Royal Caribbean's investor website.

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings

Norwegian offers holders of 100 or more shares of its stock an onboard credit of $250 per stateroom on sailings of 15 days or more $100 on sailings of seven to 14 days and $50 on sailings of six days or less. (Note that by ""days"" Norwegian means nights on board.) As with the other cruise companies you may request the onboard credit each time you cruise.

The offer applies to cruises on Norwegian Cruise Line Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises. Charter sailings are excluded.

To redeem the credit offer you may fill out a shareholder benefit request form online or you can mail or email the company with your name address email address telephone number ship and sailing date plus proof you hold the shares.

The onboard credit request must be submitted at least 15 days prior to your sailing date.

The benefit is only available for the stateroom in which the shareholder is staying and is based on your paying for two people in the cabin. Solo travelers must pay the full double occupancy fare to receive the credit. If shares are held jointly and you are requesting two or more cabins a minimum holding of 100 shares per room is required.

Norwegian does not allow the benefit to be combined with any other offer; shareholders have the option to choose between the shareholder benefit and another offer. The credit appears on your onboard account at the time of sailing and is nontransferable. It can't be used for any activities purchased prior to sailing nor for service charges/gratuities on board.

The email for Norwegian Cruise Line requests is shareholderbenefit@ncl.com. The address to mail in a request is Norwegian Cruise Line Shareholder Benefit Department 7665 Corporate Center Drive Miami FL 33126. Find addresses for the other brands and facts about the program on the company's investor website.

Bottom line

You can receive onboard credit each time you cruise by purchasing 100 or more shares of stock from a major publicly traded cruise company. This is a perk for shareholders not a reason to invest. Before agreeing to buy cruise line stock you should read the rules carefully and weigh the price of the stock versus any savings you will receive as well as understand the potential risks of your investment. Your financial adviser or broker may offer further advice.

The news comes just days after Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings announced the dropping of the vaccination requirements on all three brands.

Royal Caribbean will welcome all passengers regardless of vaccination status on sailings from Los Angeles New Orleans Galveston Texas and Europe beginning Sept. 5 ""as long as testing requirements are met"" a spokesperson told USA TODAY via email. mail on Thursday.

Rules are subject to local restrictions.

""We are working with local authorities across the Caribbean to coordinate vaccination requirements for additional routes"" the spokesperson added.

Royal Caribbean currently requires guests 12 and older to show proof of vaccination to sail from North America according to its website.

Beginning on the same date Celebrity Cruises will also welcome all test-compliant travelers from Los Angeles the United Kingdom and Europe – excluding Iceland – to its website.

The changes came after Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. announced plans to adjust its COVID-19 rules allowing all passengers to board.

Royal Caribbean Group the parent company of Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity also rolled back its testing requirements this month following the end of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's COVID-19 program for cruise ships.

""Making an Icon"" will be a new video series that Royal Caribbean will produce to provide more details and insight into Icon of the Seas.

Icon of the Seas will be the first ship in a new class of Royal Caribbean ship that the cruise line says will be ""the most transformational ship the world has ever seen.""

New episodes will launch in advance of when Icon is unveiled this fall and continue leading up to the 2023 debut.

The teaser for this new series launched today which hypes the coming episodes that promise a behind-the-scenes look at the making of Icon of the Seas.

Royal Caribbean describes the video series as an ""inside look at Royal Caribbean International’s journey to create the world’s greatest vacation – Icon of the Seas""

""Industrial engineers interior designers architects artists innovators teams across entertainment and food and beverage and more take you behind the scenes to see all that goes into envisioning designing and constructing the soon-to-be-revealed cruise ship.""

A few familiar voices are heard in the video including:

Michael Bayley Royal Caribbean International President and CEO

Harri Kulovaara Executive Vice President Maritime & Newbuilding

Jay Schneider Chief Product Innovation Officer (CXO) at Royal Caribbean Group

Up until now Royal Caribbean has been extremely quiet about revealing any details regarding Icon of the Seas.

We still don't have a design of the ship or are aware of any features.

It did slip out the name of the large white ball we've seen teased as a feature of Icon will be called ""The Pearl"".

When Mr. Bayley was asked in June 2022 about when we might get more information he pointed to September ""We are launching Icon of the Seas starting this September.""

""By launching I mean we are we are starting to communicate. We have a whole planning program of communication social media marketing TV radio you name it.""

Icon of the Seas is set to debut in late 2023.

Icon of the Seas by the numbers

While there is not a lot of information about Icon of the Seas we at least know a few stats based on publicly disclosed information.

Royal Caribbean Group shared in its form 10-Q filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission at the end of July that Icon of the Seas will have approximately 5600 berths which is the ship's capacity.

In terms of passengers Icon would have slightly less passenger capacity than an Oasis Class ship. However it remains to be seen if Icon will indeed be larger than the Oasis Class ships.

In March 2022 Royal Caribbean Senior Vice President of Hotel Operations Sean Treacy indicated Icon of the Seas will be larger than the Oasis class cruise ships.

""Icon will be the biggest. It launches in the fall of next year and will be the first new ship class for Royal in a decade"" Mr. Treacy said while onboard Wonder of the Seas during a trade event.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJveWFsY2FyaWJiZWFuYmxvZy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8xMC9yb3lhbC1jYXJpYmJlYW4tZHJvcHMtdmFjY2luZS1yZXF1aXJlbWVudC1jZXJ0YWluLWNydWlzZS1zaGlwLXNhaWxpbmdz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Caribbean drops vaccine requirement for certain cruise ship sailings,"Royal Caribbean wont require passengers to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 on select sailings beginning in September.

Up until now only unvaccinated guests under the age of 12 have been allowed on Royal Caribbean ships.

Starting with September 5th departures guests regardless of their vaccination status can cruise on the following itineraries as long as they meet any testing requirements to board:

Cruises from Los Angeles California

Cruises from Galveston Texas Please note currently only guests that show a valid vaccination record can get off the ship in Grand Cayman.

Cruises from New Orleans Louisiana Please note currently only guests that show a valid vaccination record can get off the ship in Grand Cayman.

Cruises from a European homeport Please note guests who are not “up to date” on their vaccination per EMA standards will need to take a test onboard in order to get off the ship in Greece and Spain.



Vaccination requirements remain in place until further notice for any homeport that is not mentioned above.

Royal Caribbean says it is working to allow unvaccinated on other sailings but they need to coordinate with other countries first.

""We are working with local governments in the Eastern Caribbean to align on vaccination requirements for more itineraries. We want to ensure a great experience going ashore at these ports for guests of any vaccination status while meeting local health regulations.""

Missing from this list are cruises that visit destinations in The Bahamas or Eastern Caribbean.

Royal Caribbean believes that even by allowing unvaccinated passengers onboard their health protocols far exceed that of other forms of leisure travel ""We continue to maintain additional layers of protection that far exceed any other vacation experience. This includes vaccination of all crew and keeping them up to date with boosters when eligible routine surveillance of all crew enhanced testing and treatment capabilities in our onboard medical centers and much more.""

Testing requirements

Here are the pre-arrival testing requirements for the sailings that allow unvaccinated passengers onboard.

Los Angeles & Galveston departures:

Cruises 5 nights or less: Unvaccinated guests aged 2 years and older must present a negative COVID-19 test result taken within 3 days of the sail date. Vaccinated guests regardless of age no longer need to test for sailing lengths of 5 nights or less.

Cruises 6 nights or more: All guests aged 2 years and older regardless of vaccination status must present a negative COVID-19 test result taken within 3 days of the sail date.

Accepted Tests: Any FDA‐approved PCR or antigen test supervised in person or by a telehealth professional meet this requirement.

Europe departures:

Testing requirements remain unchanged

New Orleans departures:

Testing requirements have not been finalized

Why can cruise lines now allow unvaccinated passengers onboard?

The change in policy is rooted primarily in a change in policy by the U.S. government.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ended its Covid-19 program for U.S. cruise ships July 18 2022. This allowed the cruise lines to develop their own protocols instead of it being mandated.

The CDC still makes recommendations to the lines but ultimately cruise lines craft protocols as they see fit similar to other forms of leisure travel.

Celebrity Cruises will allow unvaccinated too

Celebrity Cruises will also allow unvaccinated cruisers onboard.

Beginning September 5th 2022 all travelers regardless of vaccination status can now cruise on the following Celebrity Cruises sailings as long as they meet any testing requirements to board:

All sailings departing from the UK and Europe (with the exception of Iceland)

All sailings departing from Los Angeles to Mexican Riviera

All other sailings (and sailings departing before September 5 2022) the old restrictions still apply.

Other cruise lines also allowing unvaccinated onboard.

Royal Caribbean's announcement follows other cruise lines that have already relaxed their vaccine restrictions recently.

Norwegian Cruise Line made headlines when it announced it would end its vaccine requirement.

Beginning September 3 cruisers that are 12 or older who are unvaccinated or don't show proof of vaccination will be allowed onboard as long as they can show the results of a negative antigen or PCR test taken in the 72 hours before boarding.

Children under 12 will have no testing or vaccination requirements.

NCL's policy also applies to sister brands Oceania and Regent Seven Seas.

NCL's rule change is subject to certain local guidelines so cruises visiting Canada Bermuda or Greece will still require adults to be vaccinated.

Princess Cruises will also begin welcoming a small amount of unvaccinated adults onboard.

Princess said it will allow up to 10% of unvaccinated guests on most sailings without exemptions or vaccine status justification. Unvaccinated cruisers must apply on a first-come first-served basis. Guests will need to notify the reservations team at time of booking to ensure that they are counted as part of the 10% threshold.

Paradigm shift in policy

Allowing unvaccinated guests back on at least some ships is a major shift in policy from the last two years.

Cruise lines have restricted their ships to only allow adults that are fully vaccinated onboard since sailings restarted in late 2020.

When Royal Caribbean resumed cruises in summer 2021 vaccine requirements were in place and remained so until now.

Royal Caribbean Group CEO Jason Liberty spoke about the change during an earnings call with investors a few weeks ago and said the change is a move to be more like other forms of leisure travel such as theme parks casinos or air travel.

""We are continuing to adapt our protocols to align more closely with how the rest of society and other travel and leisure businesses are operating.""

""This means that we're transitioning to the point where everyone will be able to vacation with us while always working with our destination partners to meet their regulations."""

""What a s--- show of a job you have!"" comedian Josh Ocean Thomas said in response.

Thomas a San Diego native who moved to the Midwest to pursue comedy shared a clip of the exchange during his recent set at The Laugh Factory in Chicago on Instagram earlier this week where it has gone viral.

""You work for the Biden administration? Is your job to wake him up or what’s your job?"" Ocean asked ""Nick"" as the audience erupted into laughter.

BIDEN VOWS TO WITHHOLD WEAPONS FROM ISRAEL IF NETANYAHU GOES FORWARD WITH RAFAH INVASION

Miming a fictional Biden staffer trying to get the president’s attention he exclaimed ""Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! There’s a war! Hey!""

The bit continued with Thomas asking Nick what he really does for Biden. Before he could respond the comic remarked ""What a s--- show of a job you have. I can’t believe you admitted that in front of all these people.""

""You have the freedom to lie. You could have said you were a hooker and I would’ve been prouder of you"" he added.

The alleged Biden staffer started to tell Thomas that he travels to southern states before the comic interrupted with a burst of laughter.

""That’s crazy! You go to the south and try to sell ‘em on Biden? You’re f----- r------! What the f---? What are you talking about?"" he said. ""That’s your f----- job? Is to go ‘Hey listen I know you guys like Trump but Biden. I mean…’""

BIDEN WARNS NETANYAHU AGAINST RAFAH INVASION AS ISRAEL PREPARES FOR ACTION

The clip ended with one last joke as Thomas asked ""Wow. Are you ready to be unemployed? Or what’s your vibe?""

Thomas captioned the video writing ""This was my only option.""

Thomas wasn't the only comic to take aim at Biden this week.

Anti-Trump comedian Michael Rapaport torched the president in a video he shared to X on Thursday in which he officially declared he would not be supporting Biden’s re-election after the world leader told CNN he would not send weapons to Israel if it invades Rafah Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza.

Growing up like many teenagers UN Goodwill Ambassador and entrepreneur Sabrina Elba suffered from acne and post-inflammatory skin hyperpigmentation. With a condition that causes dark spots where active red acne pimples once were she tried acids and many products from Sephora to clear her face of breakouts only for it to do more harm than good.

“I started to really feel the effects of that as I was growing up because the skin barrier damage it was getting worse” says Elba the founder of new skin care brand S’Able Labs. “It wasn’t getting better.”

Her mother however relied on the traditions of their Somali heritage to curate a natural skincare routine that always kept her skin breakout-free.

“I grew up watching [my mom] make [her] own products and face masks and DIY everything in the kitchen” she says. “I think that was probably I mean for sure the influence that led me to adding these African botanicals into the [S’Able Labs] skincare range.”

The potency of those natural ingredients passed down from generation to generation inspired the model to start her own African skincare line with husband and fellow African Idris Elba.

“The fact that we come from East Africa and [Idris] is from West Africa and this sort of continental theme African theme this Pan-African theme … what I realized and sort of become addicted to is these stories and heritage pieces around these ingredients and these customs” says Sabrina Elba.

Their African skincare or A-Beauty line is formulated with antioxidants — including turmeric okra quasil and black seed — to target skincare concerns on a cellular level like hyperpigmentation a common condition that people with melanin experience.

Among S’Able Labs’ newest products is their Okra Face Serum which is made with a trademarked bio-available retinol called SymRenew; African Resurrection Plant an antioxidant; the brand’s own Hyperprevent technology to lessen hyperpigmentation; and botanical peptides derived from okra which the company calls “nature’s Botox.”

“This has integrity behind it and an efficacy there” Sabrina Elba says. “And I want to show people that African ingredients are so powerful.”

The tools available now comprise a progressive web app (PWA) toolkit called Salesforce Composable Storefront as well as a set of implementation accelerators for systems integrators and developer-centric Salesforce users. Salesforce also showcased a series of partnerships with independent software vendors such as Contentful Contentstack and Coveo that enable content migration into storefronts as well as content search and delivery from Salesforce users' product catalog.

The tools and partnerships show that Salesforce wants to enable customers to build commerce sites their way said Predrag Jakovljevic analyst at Technology Evaluation Centers an enterprise industry research and analysis firm. Headless commerce is a departure from the typical Salesforce low-code approach but it represents an attempt to make Commerce Cloud more customizable.

""Headless is not necessarily about low-code but rather about not imposing your user interface onto the web designers"" Jakovljevic said. ""Web designers tend to like specific tools and want to stick with them. This way you sell them the underlying commerce platform -- the catalog promotions prices order history etc. -- and let them develop their own UI and presentation layer.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vYXRyaXVtLmFpL3Jlc291cmNlcy9nZXR0aW5nLXN0YXJ0ZWQtd2l0aC1zYWxlc2ZvcmNlLXJldmVudWUtaW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Getting Started With Salesforce Revenue Intelligence,"Earlier this year Salesforce released a new product called Revenue Intelligence a fascinating combo product that helps organizations pinpoint how they are tracking targets and framing their forecasts. Revenue Intelligence includes a combination of slick custom Lightning components embedded Einstein predictions and pre-built CRM Analytics dashboards. At times it’s been positioned as a “CRM Analytics product”; and while it’s a worthwhile investment for many companies looking to upgrade their standard CRMA licenses (or get started with CRMA) a bulk of the benefits come within the Salesforce core product. Through this blog I’ll outline the different components you can expect to get with Revenue Intelligence call out some important “gotchas” that could derail your implementation if you’re not careful and help lay out a short roadmap for the order in which you should turn on the different components within Revenue Intelligence.

Above you see the 6 main components that make up Revenue Intelligence. I’ll explore each one in more depth.

1. Opportunity Insights – We’ll start small: Opportunity Insights surfaces relevant updates about opportunities in the form of an Einstein Insights component on the Home page and opportunity records. This can be things like overdue opportunities or opportunities that Einstein determines are unlikely to close in time. From the Einstein Insights component you can take direct action to update the opportunity or dismiss the alert.

Image source:

From an effort standpoint enabling Opportunity Insights is quick and relatively painless and so it’s where we recommend organizations starting with Revenue Intelligence begin. After some configuration steps as an Admin in your Salesforce environment you’ll then add the Assistant component to the Home page and the Einstein Insights component to opportunity Lightning pages.

2. Opportunity Scoring – From there we like to move on to Opportunity Scoring. This feature leverages a pre-built Einstein model to determine a propensity to close score for every opportunity. This score will essentially give you a relative likelihood that an opportunity will be won. As a caveat the Opportunity Scoring model is a black box. If you have special conditions that might significantly change the likelihood of an opportunity to close especially if those conditions are unique to your business you don’t have the ability to change the output of that model. However it’s a nice reference point and the model is built on thousands of examples. The output ends up being relevant at least directionally for almost all customers.

Image source:

3. Pipeline Inspection / Pipeline Flow – This is where things start to get really exciting. In my opinion Pipeline Inspection may be the most valuable component of Revenue Intelligence. Salesforce built a beautiful and user-friendly interface to allow salespeople to navigate through their pipeline of open opportunities and make inline edits to things like amount and close date. Intelligent alerts are built right into the component calling out suggested next steps or reminders of planned activities.

Image source

To supplement that component users can toggle to Pipeline Flow which visualizes how a user’s pipeline has trended since a selected date via a Sankey chart.

4. Einstein Activity Capture – To fully get the most out of Opportunity Insights and Revenue Intelligence Einstein Activity Capture is the next feature we recommend enabling. This could slot ahead of Pipeline Inspection but it does require connecting to an organization’s mail server (Exchange Google). Depending on how your organization operates this can be easy or it can be a bit more challenging; because of this we slot it here in our “order of Revenue Intelligence operations”.

Einstein Activity Capture allows you to sync emails events and/or contacts to Salesforce. However the data never resides in Salesforce. It does however get copied to a secure Salesforce AWS instance. I mention this simply because it can be an issue for InfoSec at some companies.

Once Einstein Activity Capture is enabled and records are syncing Einstein can comb through that data and make even more intelligent suggestions on what activities need to be done.

5. Collaborative Forecasting – Along with Pipeline Inspection Collaborative Forecasting is my favorite feature of Revenue Intelligence. Once again leveraging slick Lightning components Collaborative Forecasting presents key information on quota attainment pipeline coverage and forecast amount by category all on one page and at a user’s fingertips. Quick visual indicators show how numbers are trending and an interactive opportunity list allows updates in realtime.

It’s all great – if your organization is willing to use collaborative forecasting. At Atrium we don’t see this tool enabled nearly as often as we’d expect given its value and that can be for a variety of reasons. That becomes important because the pre-built CRMA dashboards that come with Revenue Intelligence primarily work off the Forecast objects in Salesforce. And if you’re not doing Collaborative Forecasting those objects will not be populated.

6. Revenue Insights Dashboard (CRMA) – And at last we get to the piece closest to my heart the pre-built CRMA dashboard. As Atrium’s VP of Analytics I lead our CRMA team and so we were thrilled to see these thoughtful dashboard pages created as part of the Revenue Intelligence product. There are three pages that combine to form the Revenue Insights dashboard: an Overview page a Team Performance page and a Sales Performance page.

The Overview page tracks team quota attainment against their goals and clearly shows how a given team member is faring both against their own goals and relative to their teammates. The Overview page also leverages time series forecasting to estimate when a user will hit their target as well as real-time queries against the forecast objects that allow the dashboard to be instantly updated as a user tweaks their forecast within Salesforce.

The Team Performance page within the Revenue Insights dashboards is a dynamic playground for a user (or their manager) looking to dig more deeply into some of the metrics that might be driving positive or negative performance. Users can toggle among a staggering 15 different metrics ranging from Closed Won Sales to Pipeline Coverage to Activities Completed. And for each metric they can see the top performers within the group.

Lastly the Sales Performance page allows users to compare a handful of those same metrics across a comparative dimension. So instead of just seeing Closed Won Sales you can see Closed Won Sales by Lead Source or by Opportunity Type aiding in progressively disclosing information as users uncover deeper areas they wish to explore as they move through the dashboard pages.

The lone challenge with these dashboards is as I mentioned their reliance on the forecast objects (ForecastingQuota ForecastingType ForecastingItem) as well as the forecast hierarchy. If you’re using forecasting in Salesforce they will work beautifully; if you’re not you’ll likely need to create your own dashboards to uncover some similar information.

Luckily at Atrium we have a set of pre-built accelerators that help supplement your Revenue Intelligence implementation. Tap into something small like our “Booked+Weighted Pipeline vs. Quota” component or our “Pipeline Shortfall” component either of which will help reps answer the question they care most about: “am I going to hit my number?” Or you could leverage our “Quota Scoreboard” which helps reps not only see how they’re tracking against their number but also how they stack up against their peers and how they have been trending. Or perhaps you want to dig more deeply and see team performance against a variety of metrics using our Metrics Scoreboard (pictured below).

As a whole Salesforce’s Revenue Intelligence product will be a gamechanger for many companies. It’s one of the first times Salesforce has created a bundled product and I think they did a masterful job of building a suite of tools that can rocket organizations forward in terms of sales efficiency and sales effectiveness. At Atrium we’re bullish on the product and in addition we have created supplementary accelerators to help you get the most out of your Revenue Intelligence journey.

But remote work and the high-profile exit of some of the area's tech giants are threatening that reputation and they're having an especially disturbing effect on its office market.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

San Francisco's office vacancy rate is trekking higher with a record high 24.2% of the city's office space now empty and 28.7% of it available for lease said a report by CBRE the largest commercial real-estate-services firm. The rate has jumped more than fivefold since the pandemic began and it sits well above the nationwide level of 16.9%.

The rising vacancies come as some big tech companies have seen fortunes worsen after more than a decade of riding the economic recovery from the Great Recession. Interest-rate hikes have turned off easy money for startups and have contributed to the drastic underperformance of tech stocks this year.

Now the tech industry that is known for massive hiring pushes unbeatable salaries and monumental office-space needs is cutting back. As Sundar Pichai Google's CEO said in an email announcing his company's hiring slowdown tech companies need to show ""more hunger than what we've shown on sunnier days.""

For an industry town like San Francisco such sobering sentiments are having an immediate effect. Before the pandemic 50% of the city's office leasing requests came from technology companies. From April through June they made up a third of the city's leasing requests.

The outlook for office space remains murky with tech giants struggling to get employees back into the office. Some tech workers appear to have left the city to work remotely or they've packed their bags for long-distance moves to hot markets such as Austin Texas.

Last month Twitter announced that it would close one of its San Francisco offices at 1 10th Street and that it was canceling plans to open one across the bay in Oakland. Salesforce listed over half of its office space in the 43-story Salesforce Tower the tallest building in San Francisco for lease. It listed 352300 square feet in August with an additional 60000 square feet set to hit the market in December.

Investors are taking notice too. Starwood Property Trust the mortgage-investment firm run by the legendary investor Barry Sternlicht has as of last quarter completely scrubbed its $16.5 billion loan portfolio of exposure to the ""difficult"" San Francisco office market Jeffrey DiModica the firm's president said on an earnings call.

Office trends may be having some effect on the city's famously pricey housing market. Redfin said the San Francisco market was the only major market to see home prices dip in June. One hillside mansion couldn't attract any offers even after the owner cut the asking price by more than half since April to $4.5 million Bloomberg reported.

While a real-estate correction seems likely there are some signs that the office market is stabilizing in some areas. Leasing activity was up almost 50% in April to June versus the three months prior CBRE said.

The vacancy rate of San Francisco's class A office space — the fanciest buildings that attract the most desirable tenants — was 21.3% in the second quarter. That seems to be improving with tenants last quarter leasing 52425 more square feet of Class A office space than they left.

Silicon Valley is weathering the storm better than its metropolitan neighbor. CBRE's office report showed that the San Jose area's vacancy levels were below the countrywide average hovering around 15%.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3RvbnlicmFkbGV5LzIwMjIvMDgvMTAvY29hbGl0aW9uLW9mLWN5YmVyc2VjdXJpdHktbGVhZGVycy1sYXVuY2gtb3Blbi1jeWJlcnNlY3VyaXR5LXNjaGVtYS1mcmFtZXdvcmstb2NzZi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coalition Of Cybersecurity Leaders Launch Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF),ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonybradley/2022/08/10/coalition-of-cybersecurity-leaders-launch-open-cybersecurity-schema-framework-ocsf/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3RvbnlicmFkbGV5LzIwMjIvMDgvMTAvY29hbGl0aW9uLW9mLWN5YmVyc2VjdXJpdHktbGVhZGVycy1sYXVuY2gtb3Blbi1jeWJlcnNlY3VyaXR5LXNjaGVtYS1mcmFtZXdvcmstb2NzZi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Two new open source adversary simulation tools PowerHuntShares and PowerHunt help enterprise defenders discover vulnerable network shares and manage the attack surface.

The tools will help defense identity and access management (IAM) and security operations center (SOC) teams streamline share hunting and remediation of excessive SMB share permissions in Active Directory environments NetSPI's senior director Scott Sutherland wrote on the company blog. Sutherland developed these tools.

PowerHuntShares inventories analyzes and reports excessive privilege assigned to SMB shares on Active Directory domain joined computers. The PowerHuntShares tool addresses the risks of excessive share permissions in Active Directory environments that can lead to data exposure privilege escalation and ransomware attacks within enterprise environments.

""PowerHuntShares will inventory SMB share ACLs configured with 'excessive privileges' and highlight 'high risk' ACLs [access control lists]"" Sutherland wrote.

PowerHunt a modular threat hunting framework identifies signs of compromise based on artifacts from common MITRE ATT&CK techniques and detects anomalies and outliers specific to the target environment. The tool automates the collection of artifacts at scale using PowerShell remoting and perform initial analysis.

Network shares configured with excessive permissions can be exploited in several ways. For example ransomware can use excessive read permissions on shares to access sensitive data. Since passwords are commonly stored in cleartext excessive read permissions can lead to remote attacks against databases and other servers if these passwords are uncovered. Excessive write access allows attackers to add remove modify and encrypt files such as writing a web shell or tampering with executable files to include a persistent backdoor.



""We can leverage Active Directory to help create an inventory of systems and shares"" Sutherland wrote. ""Shares configured with excessive permissions can lead to remote code execution (RCE) in a variety of ways remediation efforts can be expedited through simple data grouping techniques and malicious share scanning can be detected with a few common event IDs and a little correlation (always easier said than done).""

- What's the biggest difference between running a company-- a European company and an American company?

BILL MCDERMOTT: Speed. I think the big thing is speed. And to me the greatest asset in business is speed. One thing about American companies you know we're not shy on bureaucracy either but it is a little bit more of a challenging structure when employees and external board members participate equally in the management of senior management. There is more protocol. There is more channels that have to be operated through to get stuff done.

So I just think we move a little quicker. That's not always good by the way. Sometimes more checks and balances very positive. And I think employee representatives play a very important part in European companies if management and the employees are on the same page. But on a day-to-day basis it's just faster to operate in the US.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhicy5lZHUvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy9QYWdlcy9jYW1wdXMtZGlnaXRhbC13b3JrZmxvd3MuYXNweNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Operations Service Management: Transforming Campus Through Digital Workflows,"by Steve Church

With campus roaring back to life amid back-to-back Commencements Reunions and special events HBS IT and Operations have been partnering closely behind the scenes to ensure these activities go off without a hitch. However it’s not just major campus events that bring these departments together—they collaborate every day on finding new ways to support the HBS community.

At the heart of this collaboration? An innovative service management platform designed by Operations and IT to lay the digital foundation for teams to respond to evolving needs on campus and build on digital transformation efforts across the School.

What Is Operations Service Management?

Built in ServiceNow the platform that Operations and IT use to manage community requests the Service Management module provides a modern unified and transparent system for Operations teams to support the community.

“We receive requests from the community via Service Management and then manage and prioritize that work so we can assign it to the right resource as fast and efficiently as possible” described John O’Connor senior director of administrative services for Operations.

Service Management’s implementation stems from years of collaborative innovation between Operations and IT. An earlier example of this partnership was developing the HBS Test Kit & PPE Supply Tracker in October 2020 which became an essential inventory management tool for Operations to support the School’s COVID-19 response. This paved the way for new automated workflows to boost campus activities which eventually grew into the Service Management platform.

“This is the product of hundreds of hours of experimentation and partnership” said Xolani Ngwenya senior director IT Planning and Service Delivery. “It’s been a very interesting and rewarding journey to see how Operations can leverage tools traditionally used by IT to solve business problems across campus.”

Under the Hood of Service Management

So what exactly happens within Service Management when you place a request? Upon receipt the system generates a ticket and routes it to the appropriate Operations dispatch group—Facilities Custodial Security Operational Support Services etc.—who then assigns the task to the appropriate team members and vendors. Users receive regular automated updates throughout the process.

All of this happens from a single point of entry via the Operations Service Request portal where community members can easily search for specific services or navigate the Field Service Catalog by category. Operations and IT Service Delivery spent the past two years designing this portal to have a consistent look and feel with the IT Request portal ensuring similar community experiences engaging with Operations and IT.

Enhanced Campus Activities with Service Management

Examining the scope of work across campus for fiscal year 2022 (FY22) Operations received 49997 work orders from the community which produced 35526 associated tasks in ServiceNow. The top five groups in terms of Service Management tasks assigned are Service Counter and Housing; Operational Support Services; Moves; Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC); and Custodial Services.

One example of how the new platform improves efficiency comes from Marco Cabral maintenance technician on the Facilities team. During FY22 Marco completed 1662 tasks responding to electrical maintenance requests across campus averaging between 400–500 tasks per quarter. Marco is always on the go so new work shows up on his mobile device where he can interact with the service request and his dispatcher quickly and in real time—often within an hour of ticket creation.

Another example comes from Executive Education Guest Services who have a dashboard view into Operations work requests. When a participant comes to ExEd Guest Services they can use that dashboard to see where their work order is in process which helps provide the seamless guest support that participants have come to expect while on campus.

Digital Transformation & the Future of Service Management

What does the future hold for Service Management? As Digital Transformation has become a major focus for the School Operations and IT Service Delivery are continuing to innovate and experiment with the platform to take on larger more complex bodies of work. One recently released enhancement is a planned maintenance module for HBS residence halls that allows Operations to streamline workflows across multiple trades (painting HVAC custodial electrical etc.) for an entire building with up to 11 related tasks managed by the Housing team.

Operations and IT are also taking a more proactive approach to campus needs to reduce the number of reactive work orders. By examining the vast amount of data collected by Service Management Operations and IT have gained new insights on how to improve their own performance. IT’s Data Engineering Services team is collaborating with Operations to improve their digital competencies around data management and report analysis to better understand the HBS community their requests where work is happening on campus and how that data can benefit others around the School.

“The power of ServiceNow is in its workflows and data” concluded Ian Gaisford senior director of Finance and Operations. “We imagine the platform will continue to evolve over time to where we can draw detailed insights from the system to identify trouble spots before they manifest into a reactive service call help better identify trends to inform how we improve our built space and facilitate a greater level of understanding of how our operational resources can support the mission of the School.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNybi5jb20vbmV3cy9zZWN1cml0eS9tYWpvci1jeWJlcnNlY3VyaXR5LWNvbXBhbmllcy1jcmVhdGUtbmV3LW9wZW4tc291cmNlLWNvbnNvcnRpdW0tdG8tc2hhcmUta2V5LWRhdGHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Major Cybersecurity Companies Create New Open-Source Consortium To Share Key Data,"Major Cybersecurity Companies Create New Open-Source Consortium To Share Key Data

The new Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework unveiled at Black Hat USA 2022 is an ‘open standard that can be adopted in any environment application or solution provider and fits with existing security standards and processes’ according to the member companies.

Black Hat USA 2022 started off with a bang Wednesday with a group of major cybersecurity companies unveiling the formation of a new open-source consortium to share key data and with DNSFilter separately saying it’s acquiring Guardian a firewall and VPN platform.

The announcement by a group of cybersecurity companies—including Splunk Amazon Web Services Cloudflare CrowdStrike Palo Alto Networks Okta Trend Micro Tanium and Zscaler among others—revealed the launch of a new consortium called the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF).

The goal: to better share product-normalizing data in order to improve cybersecurity in general. All members of the cybersecurity community are invited to utilize and contribute to the OCSF.

In the companies’ joint press release the OCSF is referred to as an “open standard that can be adopted in any environment application or solution provider and fits with existing security standards and processes.”

The initiative is described as a continuation of Paul Agbabian’s Integrated Cyber Defense (ICD) Schema work done at Symantec a division of Broadcom. Agbabian is now a top executive at Splunk.

“Detecting and stopping today’s cyberattacks requires coordination across cybersecurity tools but unfortunately normalizing data from multiple sources requires significant time and resources” the group stated in its joint press release. “The OCSF is an open-source effort aimed at delivering a simplified and vendor-agnostic taxonomy to help all security teams realize better faster data ingestion and analysis without the time-consuming up-front normalization tasks.”

Experts from participating companies said there was a pressing need to start sharing key data in order to improve cybersecurity for all.

“Security leaders are wrestling with integration gaps across an expanding set of application service and infrastructure providers and they need clean normalized and prioritized data to detect and respond to threats at scale” said Patrick Coughlin group vice president security market at Splunk. “This is a problem that the industry needed to come together to solve.”

“Having a holistic view of security-related data across tools is essential for customers to effectively detect investigate and mitigate security issues” said Mark Ryland director office of the CISO at AWS.

Ryland added: “Customers tell us that their security teams are spending too much time and energy normalizing data across different tools rather than being able to focus on analyzing and responding to risks.”

Other companies involved in the founding of the OCSF include DTEX IBM Security IronNet JupitorOne Rapid7 Salesforce Securonix and Sumo Logic.

“Cybersecurity is one of the most pressing challenges of the 21st century and no single organization agency or vendor can solve it alone” said Sridhar Muppidi IBM Fellow vice president and CTO at IBM Security. “IBM Security is a long-standing supporter of open-source and open standards and believes that common data formats like the OCSF will help improve interoperability among many different cybersecurity products.”

As for the DNSFilter-Guardian deal announced Wednesday morning terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

With the deal Washington D.C.-based DNSFilter provider of DNS-based web content filtering and threat protection will be acquiring Guardian’s privacy-protecting firewall for iOS.

In a press release DNSFilter said the “acquisition allows DNSFilter to provide a robust Secure Web Gateway that more effectively protects user information and secures organizations against web-based threats.”

“Secure Web Gateway plays a critical role in modern security strategies enabling organizations to better secure access to the service edge” said Ken Carnesi co-founder and CEO of DNSFilter.

“But the technology is tired—incumbents have not kept pace with the evolving threat landscape or customer needs around service and support” he said. “Combining best-in-class Domain Name System layer security with Firewall + VPN presents a massive business opportunity and alleviates the pain points customers face with legacy SWG technology.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA4LTEwL2Vsb24tbXVzay1zZWxscy1tb3JlLXRlc2xhLXN0b2NrLWJlZm9yZS1zb2x2aW5nLXNlbGYtZHJpdmluZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elon Musk Sells More Tesla Stock Before Solving Self-Driving,"Why did this happen?

It comes as SPACs also known as ""blank check"" companies have had a tough year as inflation and interest rate hikes have shaken up the capital markets. In 2021 there were 613 SPAC listings after 248 in 2020 according to Nasdaq. This year fewer than 75 SPACs have had an initial public offering according to SPAC Analytics.

Last week David Simon chairman CEO and president of Simon Property Group resigned as chairman of Simon Property Group Acquisition Holdings. His son Eli Simon who serves as the Simon SPAC's CEO replaced his father as chairman.

In the case of Equity Distribution Acquisition Corp. or EDAC the SPAC said it plans to stop trading its shares and redeem them next month. EDAC added it would ""cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up"" on Sept. 16 according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

""The company did not find an opportunity within the period required by its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation ... that aligned with its business goals"" EDAC added.

Zell who has founded several real estate investment trusts and is chairman of Equity Group is founder and chairman of the Equity Distribution SPAC. Bill Galvin who previously served as president and CEO of Equity Group's Anixter before Wesco acquired it in 2020 is CEO of EDAC.

Chicago-based EDAC expects the redemption price for Class A common stock to be $10.01 per share.

An Equity Group Investments spokesperson did not immediately respond to an inquiry from CoStar News about whether Equity Distribution had any employees of its own that would be affected by closing the SPAC.

""The Redemption Amount will be paid on September 19 2022 to the beneficial owners of public shares held in street name without any required action on their part"" EDAC said in the SEC filing.

Zell launched Equity Distribution Acquisition Corp. in July 2020 with plans to raise about $300 million from its initial public offering. As of June 30 it had assets of nearly $415 million and liabilities of the same amount according to its latest quarterly report filed with the SEC.

Equity Distribution planned to pursue acquisition and merger targets in any industry but it intended to initially focus on identifying prospective businesses in the North American industrial sector the company said in its IPO filing.

EDAC said there would be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to its warrants ""which will expire worthless.""

It also said the company’s sponsor directors and members of its management team ""have waived their rights to liquidating distributions with respect to all founder shares held by them.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2Jvc3Rvbi9uZXdzL2xpYmVydHktdHJlZS1tYWxsLWRhbnZlcnMtc2FsZS_SAUdodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvYm9zdG9uL25ld3MvbGliZXJ0eS10cmVlLW1hbGwtZGFudmVycy1zYWxlLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Liberty Tree Mall in Danvers listed for sale,"Liberty Tree Mall in Danvers listed for sale

This is an incredibly challenging situation and we are working closely with local officials to make sure people have the help they need as they begin the long road to recovery. Some areas remain cut off due to damaged roads and bridges and Red Cross disaster workers are bringing food and relief supplies to people by boat. Preliminary damage reports indicate that nearly 1400 homes were either destroyed or suffered major damage.

RED CROSS RESPONSE Today some 400 trained Red Cross disaster workers are on the ground in Kentucky helping to provide a safe place to stay food to eat critical relief supplies and emotional support for those affected by this tragedy. Volunteers are also replacing prescription medications eyeglasses or critical medical equipment like canes and wheelchairs which were left behind in the rush to get to safety.

Wednesday night the Red Cross and our partners provided comfort and care for more than 430 residents in 13 shelters across Eastern Kentucky. Since the flooding hit the region the Red Cross and our partners have provided a total of nearly 6000 overnight stays for residents forced to leave their homes. More than a dozen Red Cross emergency response vehicles are circulating through the hardest hit communities with volunteers providing meals and cleanup supplies.

With the support of local partners the Red Cross has helped to provide some 81000 meals and snacks to people in need. In addition we’ve given out thousands of critical relief items to over 1400 households.

Red Cross care teams are meeting with families who have lost loved ones to offer specialized support including disaster mental health services and other information.

However when you're an income investor your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.

Cash flow can come from bond interest interest from other types of investments and of course dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.

Headquartered in Kenosha Snap-On (SNA) is a Consumer Discretionary stock that has seen a price change of 2.83% so far this year. The tool and diagnostic equipment maker is paying out a dividend of $1.42 per share at the moment with a dividend yield of 2.56% compared to the Tools - Handheld industry's yield of 0.69% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.62%.

Taking a look at the company's dividend growth its current annualized dividend of $5.68 is up 11.2% from last year. Snap-On has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 14.71%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Snap-On's current payout ratio is 36% meaning it paid out 36% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.

SNA is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $15.93 per share which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 6.77%.

Bottom Line

Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However not all companies offer a quarterly payout.

For instance it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said they can take comfort from the fact that SNA is not only an attractive dividend play but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).

The launch of the subscription offering priced in India at 49 Indian rupees follows Snap introducing the $4 subscription offering in the U.S. the U.K. and Canada among a few other key markets in late June.

After lagging for several years in India the largest market by users for Google and Facebook Snapchat has grown phenomenally in the South Asian market in the last two years. The app had more than 105 million monthly active users in India last month up from about 25 million two years ago according to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. (An industry executive shared the data with TechCrunch.)

“India is an important market for Snap and investments in localizing the app experience has been key to our growth in the region” said Lakshya Malu Interim Market Development Lead Snap in a statement.

A subscription to Snapchat+ allows users to access about half a dozen additional features such as the ability to pin an individual as their best friend on the profile change app icon and a rewatch indicator that helps determine how many people are rewatching stories. Snapchat+ also allows customers to follow Ghost Trails on Snap Map to follow the general direction of friends if they have agreed to share their location.

In just over a month since Snapchat+’s launch in many markets the offering has helped the company increase its revenue by over $5 million according to Sensor Tower.

Snap joins scores of companies including Apple Spotify Netflix Google that have launched their premium offerings in India at a fraction of the global price. Even as India is a key overseas region for technology and entertainment giants very few choose to pay for services in the world’s second largest internet market.

For Snap success in India may be crucial. The firm which serves 347 million users worldwide posted a disappointing second-quarter results last month and said it plans to slow hiring.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHVsYXJtZWNoYW5pY3MuY29tL2NhcnMvYTQwODU5ODUxL21pY2hhZWxwcm9zLWNsaWNrLXRocm91Z2gtdG9ycXVlLXdyZW5jaC1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MichaelPro Click Through Torque Wrench | Best Product Reviews 2022,"There’s a clear consensus that getting a flat tire is a poor experience. Being stranded on the side of the road is not only inconvenient. It's also dangerous. Plus if you’re committed enough to change a flat yourself—instead of throwing in the towel and calling AAA—it’s not like you have a complete Snap-On toolkit at your disposal; the equipment in your trunk has been designed to be economical on weight and functionality.

Thankfully MichaelPro makes a stout tire iron replacement that doubles as a torque wrench. Its double functionality is made possible thanks to a bit driver that slides up and down the shaft of the torque wrench—the driver clicks into place at the top and at the middle. In its T-mode (with the driver at the top) it can be used as a torque wrench while X-mode (with the driver in the middle) is best used for breaking wheel nuts loose and tightening them back up most of the way.

MichaelPro MichaelPro Click Through Torque Wrench $62 at Amazon

Below I’ve laid out how it works along with some of my most and least favorite features.

Breaking Wheel Nuts Loose

When it comes to breaking wheel nuts loose the standard “wrench” that comes in the back of my Volkswagen GTI just doesn’t cut it. I’d wager my pencil-thin arms could play a role but let’s not dwell on that. More often than not I need to use my body weight and my feet to work any of the wheel nuts loose. However MichaelPro’s torque wrench doubles as an excellent tire iron easing both the removal and installation processes.



Trevor Raab

You’ll see that with the driver in its X-position the tool gives me plenty of leverage to break all of the wheel nuts loose with ease. Plus once I’ve done the hard work the driver spins freely allowing me to spin the nuts the rest of the way off. No more getting your fingers filthy to get those lugs off.

Getting The Right Fit For Your Vehicle

While MichaelPro says that the provided sockets fit up to 90 percent of vehicles they aren’t exactly what you’d call a “factory fit.” Sure the 11⁄16–inch socket worked on my GTI but it didn’t feel like an absolute match. A quick measure with a set of calipers reveals that they’re actually 17.4 millimeters—problematic for my GTI that necessitates a 17mm socket. However it's really no big deal if you have an existing 1⁄2–inch socket set knocking around as those will be millimeter–perfect.

The included sockets are all constructed using chrome vanadium an industry standard for tools that see high–impact usage. Just as its name states it’s a type of steel created using chromium and vanadium. During the refining process workers will heat–treat the material to reinforce it. This inherent rigidity makes it perfect for use in hand tools but not ideal for more stringent applications like impact wrenches.

Torque To Spec

Trevor Raab Trevor Raab

The meat and potatoes of the MichaelPro Click Through torque wrench is that it is ahem a torque wrench. And a good one at that. While X-mode is great for breaking wheel nuts loose—and tightening them back up most of the way—T-mode will give you the most leverage for using the torque wrench properly. Once the nuts are snug you’ll want to finish them off with the torque wrench to prevent over-tightening them which is bad news.

If you’ve used a torque wrench before the Click Through is business as usual in T-mode. However we’ll indulge those of you who may be new. The bottom of the tool has a locking knob that allows you to adjust the torque figure from 50 pound-feet all the way to 130 lb-ft. After checking my owner's manual to find the correct torque figure I could easily engage the knob at the bottom of the torque wrench and select the proper number for my vehicle—88 lb-ft if you’re a Mk 7 Volkswagen GTI owner who is keeping track.

While it’s easy to say “what’s the big deal it’s just a torque wrench” it’s actually so much more than that. As someone who is generally a nervous wreck when working on my car I’m always second-guessing if I’ve done things right. However torque wrenches give you peace of mind in knowing that your wheel nuts (and really any other fasteners) are installed properly—and the chance of them coming off is slim to none.

Small But Mighty Package

Trevor Raab

When it comes to keeping things in the trunk of my car I prefer them to be relatively small and discrete; thankfully the hard-plastic case the Click Through comes in is just that. My only minor gripe is that it slid around quite a bit when not in use. However that was fixed with a small piece of velcro on the bottom of the box to help it stay put.

Company's community reinvestment off to a good start,"Less than a year ago the corner of 38th Street and Sheridan Avenue offered a mostly empty parking lot and a bus stop. There were no grocery stores within walking distance. Arlington Woods residents worked hard to address food insecurity and other results of historic disinvestment.

The bus stop is still there and now it sits next to an almost 50000-square-foot medical device manufacturing plant. The Goodwill Commercial Services facility is a one-story brick building with lofty windows. Right outside is a woodsy courtyard with a small picnic table.

Goodwill of Central and Southern Indiana built the facility to manufacture medical devices including drainage catheters and needles for Bloomington-based Cook Medical. And residents collaborated with Goodwill and Cook to ensure the business plan includes significant community investment.

That plan is now launched including a community-owned grocery store set to open early next year. And the manufacturing facility opens at least 100 new jobs in the neighborhood. Juanita Easterling director of plant operations said all those hired at the time of this reporting were from the community.

And now that it’s open it hosts wellness and community events for those employees.

“We like to focus on the whole thing here: mind body and spirit” Easterling said.

Those resources include yoga classes community meetings and wrap-around services like professional development mental health treatment housing support and life coaching.

“I don't have to call anybody I can just say ‘hey I have an employee that's facing homelessness. We need some housing support” Easterling said. “And boom we got the resource right here.”

Two life coaches are on site and one of them works specifically with employees who have criminal records. With that life coach they can go through a re-entry program New Beginnings. It is one of more than 40 business and social service partners many nonprofit that Cook Medical hired to provide community support.

Easterling said those partners help residents break the cycle of poverty.

“We allow the community to use the facility as they wish you know because we are here to be a partner” Easterling said. “We're not here to build on a community we're here to be a partner with the community.”

Good job access

The Cook Medical facility opened in early May. Goodwill has now hired a fifth of the starting workforce. At the time of this reporting 20 employees worked in the lab. And Goodwill is still hiring. The goal is to have 100 employees by the end of the year.

“I am proud to say we’re probably one of the only buildings and facilities right now in Indiana that has a waiting list to work” Easterling said. “I have 100 applicants that have applied to be a supervisor. And then I have a waiting list of 100 from walk-ins from open interviews and from online applications.”

The jobs start at $15 an hour most are full-time and they include benefits. Those “good jobs” come from a model of corporate social responsibility -- an approach that prioritizes positive impacts on the community as part of business practices.

Cook and Goodwill chose this neighborhood because of its historical disinvestment. In the 1980s and 1990s industrial giants moved out one by one taking the jobs with them. While the suburbs gained high-paying jobs most growth in the city came from lower-paying jobs. The area’s middle class moved away.

What does the community think?

Longtime northeast Indianapolis resident Dora Figueroa was one of the facility's first employees.

Before working here she worked in restaurants for nearly 25 years. She started doing basic assembly when the plant opened in May then after just a few months her boss asked her to be a supervisor. She said no other employer had ever offered her a promotion.

“You're gonna be an employee all the time. Just an employee” Figueroa said. “But when I came over here I started as a very low employee. And later they made me grow up. I can tell. I like learning every day.”

She is also taking advantage of the company’s tuition aid that can be connected to GED programs. Employees can work towards high school and college degrees on the clock so they don’t have to sacrifice wages.

She said before this job she gave up hope for her high school degree.

“Since coming to this position my life has been changing so much” she said. “I can tell you after 25 years I come over here and this is my first opportunity to learn and to grow up.”

Figueroa is not alone many residents said they are pleased by the economic development opportunities. Those opportunities include a community-run grocery store – as many as five grocery stores closed over the past few years and the neighborhood became a food desert.

Northeastside native Michael McFarland is active in efforts to address food insecurity in the area. He served in the military and said when he returned to the Arlington Woods neighborhood he was devastated.

“I’ve been in third world countries that have better access to food” McFarland said.

To address that he and friend Marckus Williams started Wall Street Grocery a small convenience store on 38th Street. And when Cook Medical and Goodwill chose the neighborhood they connected with McFarland and Williams.

“We’ve struggled a lot just trying to provide that for our neighborhood” McFarland said. “So we’re just fortunate to have Cook and Goodwill come along and partner with us and help us provide this necessary item to the neighborhood on a major level.”

McFarland and Williams will run and own Indy Fresh Market a multi-million dollar full-size grocery store next door to the Cook facility. The market is set to open in the spring of next year. Cook will transfer operations and ownership to McFarland and Williams through a rent-to-own model. Though it's early to predict McFarland said that with their prospective sales it won't be long until they have 100 percent ownership of the store.

McFarland said the Cook/Goodwill community investment business model is helping the neighborhood.

“It's no small thing” McFarland said. “Most people don't have even the smallest support system to help them get over the smallest obstacles.”

He says his brother was recently released from incarceration and hired at the manufacturing facility. He’s been working there for three months. That made it possible for him to buy a car and he plans to get his own apartment soon.

Is this model replicable?

Ashley Gurvitz CEO of the United Northeast Community Development Corporation thinks so – if companies are willing to work directly with communities.

“The first bits of making this happen is identifying who are those other CEOs that have this mission and vision and that also know the importance of having community” Gurvitz said. “Get out of the boardroom and get into your community.”

Gurvitz is a longtime resident of the area and she has been facilitating conversations with community members and stakeholders since the early planning stages for the manufacturing facility. She helped Cook and Goodwill get community input and prioritize community needs – like the grocery store.

“We didn't wait until the vision was done and then say oh here are the developers” Gurvitz said. “And so the moment we found out about the very first group of stakeholders we involved our residents. I'm like ‘Hey we have this potential opportunity. Let me know your feedback.’’’

She said the input is ongoing. A council of residents meets with stakeholders monthly to share feedback plan events and identify obstacles. That informs how partners come together with the community to work with people facing the effects of disinvestment.

Tom Guevara is the director of Indiana University’s Public Policy Institute. He said this emerging corporate model of prioritizing community reinvestment is seen as an example nationally.

“Normally the private sector comes in and its part is to build a place where people can be hired and employed and gain wages” Guevara said.

He said traditionally corporate community investment comes as donations to community organizations but that's about it.

“[But here] Cook is saying… look we're going to have to help them overcome some of these other life barriers that have prevented them from gaining greater economic and personal autonomy.”

Its owner the international company EVRAZ plc is looking for buyers for its North American business.

The Pueblo facility recycles scrap steel into train track rails pipe and other products — and employs more than a thousand people. A new solar-powered mill that will produce long rails is currently under construction at the Southern Colorado site. It has continued to operate despite international sanctions levied against Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich who owns about 30 percent of the company.



A company spokesman said the sale announcement is having no effect on operations at the mill. He also said employees also received a direct letter from EVRAZ North America CEO Skip Herald regarding the sale.



According to the company’s announcement any potential sale will be subject to United Kingdom regulatory requirements because the company is headquartered there. It would also likely be subject to U.S. regulatory scrutiny as well.

Bottom line

We're pretty impressed with these prices from Southwest — and not just when using the SAVE40 promo code. While it's not super clear which U.S. destinations are included in the deal it's worth giving it a shot if you're looking to travel domestically.

Unfortunately we didn't have much luck with flights to and from Hawaii.

Since it's not clear if this sale is what's causing these good prices you may want to book by the recommended time of 11:59 p.m. CDT. However you might get lucky and find that these prices last even longer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdvb2Rtb3JuaW5nYW1lcmljYS5jb20vbGl2aW5nL3ZpZGVvL21vdGhlci1kYXVnaHRlci1waWxvdC1kdW8tbWFrZS1oaXN0b3J5LXNvdXRod2VzdC1haXJsaW5lcy04ODE4Njg1MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mother-daughter pilot duo make history with Southwest Airlines,"Mother-daughter pilot duo make history with Southwest Airlines

This annual Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) focused event brought together representatives from the world’s largest airlines aviation experts and commercial aviation solution providers to discuss advancements in aviation technology and explore what the future could hold as EFBs continue to evolve and as connectivity becomes more readily available in the cockpits of commercial and business aircraft fleets.

EFBs have already demonstrated their ability to make life better for flight crews decrease costs for airlines and make flight operations more efficient. However there are some in the industry that thinks we’re only starting to scratch the surface of what the EFB can do.

To better understand the potential behind EFBs Connected Aviation Today spoke with Will Ware the Co-Chair of the AEEC-IATA EFB Users Forum and a Captain at Southwest Airlines. Here is what he had to share about the future of aviation and the evolving role EFBs will play in it.

Connected Aviation Today (CAT): You are the Co-Chair of the AEEC-IATA EFB Users Forum which was recently held in Annapolis. Can you tell our readers a bit about EFBs? Why are they such an essential tool for airlines and flight crews? Why are they a better alternative to the flight bags of years past?

Will Ware: Well to cover the basics the Electronic Flight Bag or EFB is the digital version of those older leather flight cases that pilots used to carry. Those folders often contained much of the pre-fight material a pilot needed to do their job effectively such as maps weather charts and other materials.

What this tool does is replace that paper item with something much more easily accessible. The EFB is a tablet that has gone through a regulatory process defined by Advisory Circular AC120-76. This allows air carriers to utilize electronic solutions to not only replace the paper folder but to do so much more.

“The EFB is a tablet that has gone through a regulatory process defined by Advisory Circular AC120-76. This allows air carriers to utilize electronic solutions to not only replace the paper folder but to do so much more.” — Will Ware

With cellular networks on the ground and aircraft that can provide Wi-Fi at altitude pilots can now access more up-to-date information on weather turbulence communications and more.

CAT: How have EFBs evolved and improved since they were first introduced? Is there more capability and functionality today? What capabilities have been added and what innovations introduced since they were first implemented across the airlines?

Will Ware: There have been some major changes but those have mostly been tied to the changes in tablets and portable electronics in general. When the portable EFB took off in 2010 there were a few consumer tablets on the market like the iPad. Both the EFB and those tablets had very limited applications and those applications met very specific needs.

In those early days airlines just struggled with the basics of how and where to mount tablets how to manage backup power and how to gain approvals to use the device itself. This led to a lot of innovation including 5G cellular and improved aircraft Wi-Fi. Leveraging all this has allowed us to build a platform that enables the use of available technology and the future technology we are still developing.

CAT: What functionality and capability do you feel is missing in today’s EFBs? Are there solutions or applications that you’d like to see introduced?

Will Ware: Today the functionalities we are most interested in are turbulence awareness and fuel-saving applications.

With turbulence pilots would previously bring paper weather forecasts with them as a part of their paper folder. The issue with forecasts is that they can change since the weather is volatile. What we want to do is to provide a way for a pilot to know what the turbulence looks like right when they pull a report.

“Recently at the EFB Users Forum we saw no less than eight new applications that are attempting to help the pilot save fuel. With the current high price of fuel I expect those capabilities to continue being a major focus area in the future.” — Will Ware

One very interesting new application is Sky Path which uses the tablet’s accelerometer to detect turbulence report that to the ground and finally distribute that information to other pilots in that area. Like crowdsourcing this allows the flight crew to change course if needed alert passengers ahead of time and prepare the cabin for any potential disruptions much faster than before. We want to find ways to further ingrain this technology and bring that capability to more aircraft.

On the fuel savings front it should come as no surprise that there is a lot of focus on this space right now both because of the price of fuel and because of longer-term sustainability goals. Recently at the EFB Users Forum we saw no less than eight new applications that are attempting to help the pilot save fuel. With the current high price of fuel I expect those capabilities to continue being a major focus area in the future.

Once the EFB starts to interact more and blend with workgroups we will see some major advancements. For instance in the U.S. a dispatcher plans a flight and they are trying their best to plan a route that saves fuel but there are always complications. Pilots when they are executing that plan they have the discretion to take wind speed turbulence temperature and other factors into consideration and alter their flight plan accordingly.

Another interesting application could result from NASA projects like TASAR. As you can imagine things like rocket launches can intrude on airspace commonly used by planes. However there may be a way to make launches and flight plans synergize better allowing further fuel and time savings by opening space when not in use.

“I say this all the time: our event is where you are heard and where we can make a change not only in regulations but also with the vendors.” — Will Ware

CAT: During the AEEC-IATA EFB Users Forum Jon Merritt of Collins Aerospace introduced a concept that he called “application bloat.” Do you feel that the introduction of multiple disparate applications to the EFB has become overwhelming for pilots? Is it impacting the user experience of the EFB?

Will Ware: Absolutely anything Jon says is worth paying attention to because he has been in this space for a long time and is a major thought leader.

That being said I will agree with what Jon said. In the early days we had only a few apps and they each had a specific purpose. Now we have a multitude of apps for charting documents weather performance de-icing and other functionality. What’s worse is that none of these apps talk to each other resulting in pilots needing to reenter the same data multiple times into different applications.

The AEEC/IATA EFB Users Forum is an AIRINC function and we have an EFB Sub-committee where EFB standards are created. One such standard that the sub-committee is working on is a standard where EFB applications could share data.

There are some applications called “Dashboards” that are trying to consolidate data into one unified workflow and this is what Jon’s company Collins Aerospace is building with their new FlightHub application. There were also other examples of these apps at our event including Aviobook Jeppesen Aviator NAVBLUE and more.

CAT: Were there any new solutions applications or platforms that were introduced at the EFB Users Forum that you found particularly exciting? Why did these solutions stand out for you?

Will Ware: The flight path optimization applications that are attempting to save fuel and time are interesting and I was amazed there were so many. But I think there is still a bit of research on how to best make those work – not only for the airline but for the National Airspace System as a whole. The vertical savings are big but the lateral changes in closed airspace opening aircraft saturation weather movement and more make the lateral optimization interesting too.

CAT: Aside from being the AEEC-IATA EFB Users Forum Co-Chair you’re also a proponent of EFB advancement and adoption. Why are events like the AEEC-IATA EFB Users Forum essential? What do attendees get out of it? How do these events help advance the technology – and the aviation industry as a whole?

Will Ware: First thanks for letting me share my thoughts on the EFB which are derived from more than 11 years of being deeply involved in this space and the relationship I have cultivated with other airlines and vendors.

The differentiator of the AEEC/IATA EFB users forum is this is the meeting where we as a body engage regulators like the FAA EASA and more and we affect policy change. We do have an Expo and our vendors are a key component of our event but showcasing vendors is only part of our event. We have presentations from regulators airlines vendors and occasionally a panel for Q&As.

I say this all the time: our event is where you are heard and where we can make a change not only in regulations but also with the vendors. If you must pick between events please pick ours because we are more powerful when we are aligned.

CAT: There has been a lot of attention recently around EFB security with a few articles raising both concerns and praise. What do you think about those concerns and what those articles had to say?

Will Ware: Yes I’m familiar with the articles and the subject of security. I will tell you that EFB Security is a session that we have at every EFB user’s forum conference. Each airline each EFB application vendor and each airframer all have very capable security teams that constantly track threats and provide guidance.

“…we as an EFB community are highly focused on security as evident by the fact that it is a constant session in our forum…” — Will Ware

With that said these recent articles and the regulators are inflating security concerns to a point where decision makers may develop policies that are damaging to the EFB. Remember at the beginning of this article I stated that the EFB was a place where innovation can happen specifically because it is NOT an aircraft system and let’s not forget the definition of an EFB as stated in AC120-76 section 6 which defines the failure must be considered minor or no safety effect.

One of these articles from a company that sells security counseling gained physical access to an airframe grounded for COVID and destined for scraping. They then powered that aircraft and accessed a Windows-based installed EFB with a password of PASSWORD. I’m assuming this was done because the aircraft was out of service. Then they claimed that they could hack the performance app to make the runway longer and cause an accident.

I think these people have watched Die Hard 2 too many times where terrorists lower the glideslope and the crew flies a Windsor 114 into the ground!

The facts are these: most all Airlines use portable EFBs which are based on Apple’s iOS. Apple’s operating system is “Sandboxed” and thus applications don’t talk to each other. So an aircraft in service would not allow physical access to the flight deck as that is a TSA violation and the portable EFB would be in possession of the pilot so they would not have physical access to the device. Finally my Airline’s security profile requires that the password is both complex and subject to frequent changes.

I say all of this because we as an EFB community are highly focused on security as evident by the fact that it is a constant session in our forum but also because if people are scared of new restrictive policies that don’t fit what is happening in the EFB industry then we will lose the ability to innovate which would do a disservice to the potential benefits that EFB can provide.

By the way at our last conference in Annapolis MD we worked with Apple and EFB vendors to estimate that we have had over 250+ million flights with portable EFBs which is an amazing accomplishment in just 10 years.

Let’s keep innovating on this platform!

A simple combination of Starbucks Cold Brew and lemonade the beverage is being roundly dragged on social media.

First up was a TikTok from @kayli.cernan a 21-year-old Starbucks barista. Their brief video shows them going on a roller coaster of emotions while making and then sampling the drink. There was the initial surprise upon being introduced to the new menu item; the subtle fear while mixing the cold brew and lemonade together; and then the disappointment that followed the first sip.

The video on TikTok has raked in 1.3 million views with commenters echoing @kayli.cernan's sentiments. One user even claimed that the drink ""was traumatizing to try.""

Over on Reddit the Cold Brew with Lemonade isn't doing too much better. An entire Reddit thread has been dedicated to criticizing the drink.

""I’m convinced the cold brew with lemonade is a sick joke put out by corporation-tried it & it’s probably one of THE most repulsive things I’ve ever tasted. Doesn’t even taste like something you should be ingesting"" wrote the Redditor who created the thread.

Not every Starbucks customer was immensely unimpressed by the drink. One Reddit user described it favorably as ""a coffee Arnold Palmer.""

The AT&T store will occupy 1400 feet and Door County Medical Center will operate the new express clinic in its 1700 feet of space.

Robinson said the Starbucks space actually is about 100 feet larger than a typical Starbucks with the added space intended for extra storage which means the company's supply trucks won't have to haul up to Door County as often as they do to locations in larger communities.

Robinson is president of First & Main Properties a retail development company based in St. Louis. First & Main is developing the property in partnership with Illuminate Real Estate a retail development company with offices in Denver and Boca Raton Florida. The Sturgeon Bay Starbucks will be the fifth the partnership has built and the sixth for Robinson with all those previous sites in the St. Louis area.

He said he first came to Door County for a vacation in 1990 and has visited every year since owning property in Northern Door County at one time. He saw the opportunity to bring a full-service Starbucks to the area about four years ago he said.

""(It was) a time when Starbucks was looking at getting into smaller markets"" Robinson said. ""When the Woldt property became available I jumped on it.""

Robinson said he had hoped to save the buildings that were on the property — besides the restaurant there were six small cottages — and had another party interested in them. But he said the other party could only move four of the cottages because two were too dilapidated to salvage and the restaurant also had condition issues that meant it couldn't move and had to be razed.

Starbucks has an existing location in Sturgeon Bay one of its small shops inside the Target store just off State 42 about a mile away. Robinson said he believes that store will remain open; a number of Targets across the country have a smaller Starbucks inside that operate under a licensing agreement between the two companies while full-service Starbucks stores are owned and operated by the coffee company. In larger communities the two different Starbucks often operate within range of each other.

Sturgeon Bay Mayor David Ward who took part in the groundbreaking said the city will benefit from having two international companies with retail stores at a high-traffic intersection just before the main entrance off the highway into Sturgeon Bay from the south. Also at the same intersection across County S from the new development is a Walgreens pharmacy.

""It's a big deal. It'll help the whole retail image of Sturgeon Bay"" Ward said. ""These (Starbucks and AT&T) are blue-chip names.""

Residents and small businesses in Door County especially Northern Door have often pushed back against national chains and big-box retailers that have wanted to open on the Peninsula. Sturgeon Bay has a number of independent coffee shops throughout its downtown Door County Coffee & Tea has its roastery and retail store just north of the city in Carlsville and there are numerous cafes throughout the rest of the county.

However Ward said he's heard enough positive reaction about the new Starbucks to make it worthwhile to the city.

""I just liken it to the reaction we got with Kwik Trip (the convenience store chain which is planning a Sturgeon Bay location)"" Ward said. ""People are eager to have a Kwik Trip here and there's a segment of the population that wants to have a Starbucks here.""

Although the EV machines do not affect the company’s multifaceted global supply chain nor do they reduce emissions or resource usage within participating Starbucks stores the company is pitching the partnership as part of its longer-term environmental sustainability commitment.

That’s not to say the partnership isn’t forward-looking. Most major automotive brands and manufacturers have vowed to dramatically increase production of electric vehicles by the end of this decade. For its part Volvo has pledged to become a fully electric car company by 2030 while aspiring for 50% fully automatic sales by 2025.

Considering the fact that electric vehicles take anywhere from 30 minutes to half a day or more to reach a full charge Starbucks now has plans to be there for car owners who may have some time on their hands.

The first four charging stations in the partnership — available free or at a discounted rate to Volvo users or for a small fee to other EV drivers — just rolled out in Provo Utah. According to the partnership as many as 60 DC fast chargers in total will be introduced to 15 Starbucks store locations in a 1350-mile stretch from suburban Denver to Seattle.

The route winds through national forests and major community hubs from the Colorado Rockies to the Starbucks Support Center (headquarters) in Seattle. The stations will be placed approximately 100 miles apart from one another offering new infrastructure for EVs — as well as some new sales for Starbucks.

A press release from Volvo sums up the strategy: “While customers’ cars are recharging outside drivers can relax comfortably inside with their favorite Starbucks beverages.”

The entrepreneur launched the State Street Axe Club at 427 State St. with a soft opening last week and a full opening this week after more than two years of trying to open a business during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The wait however appears well worth it.

“This town needs entertainment” Michaelson told Noozhawk. “People want something to do at night for fun. They don’t just want to sit around and go to the bar again.”

In an innovative yet simple concept customers can throw axes at dartlike wooden targets. That’s it. The appeal however is both primal and creative. One Internet search reveals that axe throwing is a growing trend perhaps even hotter than pickleball and smash rooms.

The cost is $35 an hour for a throwing lane for a person. Participants have to sign a waiver just in case something goes awry but that’s not likely with Michaelson and his eager-eyed staff monitoring every throw.

They will even provide a primer on how to throw. “Hold it like a baseball bat dominant hand on top” Michaelson said.

There are two ways to throw but like any good athlete each person will have to figure out their own style. Two hands over the head and thrown forward (don’t flick though just release) is the most popular style. Or like this reporter the one-handed throw like a short-armed baseball pitch can also result in a bull’s-eye.

The place booms with loud music a mix of 1980s pop hip hop alternative and classic rock. On Tuesday afternoon shortly after the business opened a steady stream of people walking by stopped to peer inside many of them surprised that Santa Barbara has a place to throw axes.

Among the customers on Tuesday were Richard and Hope Wood tourists from Fresno who Googled “axe throwing” and found the Santa Barbara business.

“This is the first time we have ever thrown axes” Richard Wood said. “Ten stars out of five.”

On Wednesday he said he and his wife were going to get tattoos. The axe-throwing however was the vacation highlight in Santa Barbara.

“It’s super fun super cool” he said.

It may be fun but it is also serious business. There’s no drinking allowed and although other axe-throwing clubs allow alcohol Michaelson said he has no plans to apply for any kind of liquor license.

He helped launch an axe-throwing business in Los Angeles. He went to UCSB and had a vision to open a business downtown.

He first threw an axe about three years ago. He became addicted. He said his biggest piece of advice for new axe-throwers is “Don’t overthink it.”

“This is something different and a lot of fun” he said. “It’s a great way to let out a lot of stress after a tough day.”

The business is open from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Wednesday. It’s college night on Thursdays and it’s open from 4 p.m. to midnight. Students get $5 off. It’s open from 2 p.m. to midnight on Fridays from noon to midnight on Saturdays and from noon to 10 p.m. on Sundays.

“But if people keep coming in I will stay open” Michaelson said. “Santa Barbara is beautiful. We have the beaches we have amazing food boutiques handmade items but we need more entertainment.”

DETROIT ARSENAL Mich. – A break in the rain allowed members of the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command to officially welcome Command Sgt. Maj. Kendra St Helen as the command’s senior non-commissioned officer and senior advisor in an Aug. 8 outdoor ceremony at Detroit Arsenal.

“Command Sergeant Major St Helen on behalf of the TACOM community we’re proud to now call you one of our own” said Maj. Gen. Darren Werner TACOM commanding general and host of the Assumption of Responsibility ceremony.

“I know you understand the importance of what we do here at TACOM and the immense impact we have as a team in supporting Soldiers in their respective missions” he continued. “Your support of this team – the TACOM team – will help to ensure our ability to continue to provide and maintain our commitment to excellence.”

“I know that you’ve already received a warm TACOM and Detroit Arsenal welcome and that welcome has also been extended to your awesome Army family” Werner said.

“It is an honor and a privilege for me and my family that I stand here before you today joining the Army’s preeminent ground and support systems provider – the United States Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command” St Helen said in her first public remarks as the TACOM command sergeant major.

“As a junior Soldier I utilized and depended upon my gear and equipment – the very equipment this organization is responsible for” she added noting that TACOM provides more than sixty percent of the equipment used in an Army combat brigade.

St Helen is the first black female to hold the top non-commissioned officer position within TACOM headquarters. She has more than 26 years of active-duty service and is a member of the Sergeant Audie Murphy Club a recipient of the Distinguished Order of St. Martin and the Order of St. Christopher and has earned a President’s Lifetime Achievement Award.

The average age of a Fortune 500 CFO is 53. However there’s a portion of finance chiefs who work at some of America’s largest companies that haven’t yet reached age 40. Meta’s Susan Li will become the latest addition to the list which also includes the “Master of Coin.”

Li age 36 has served as the VP of finance at Meta the parent company of Facebook since 2008. The company announced in its recent Q2 2022 earnings report that current CFO David Wehner will take on a new role as Meta’s first chief strategy officer effective Nov. 1 and Li will be promoted to CFO.

“I joined Meta 14 years ago back when we were a handful of Facebook employees scattered across a few buildings in downtown Palo Alto” Li wrote in a LinkedIn post on July 27 following the announcement. “I’ve been lucky to work at a company that has grown tremendously during my career.”

When first joining the company she was one of two people focused on revenue forecasts sales budget plans and business operations. Li played an integral part of the finance team that helped with Facebook’s IPO and was promoted to a VP of Finance in 2016 according to the company. Before her career at Meta the Stanford University grad was an analyst at Morgan Stanley.

“I’m delighted that Susan Li will take over as CFO” Wehner said in a LinkedIn post. “She has been a key partner since I joined Facebook a decade ago and this transition is part of a long-term succession plan that we have been discussing for several years.” Li began co-presenting alongside Wehner during Meta’s quarterly follow-up earnings calls in 2020. According to research Meta shared with me on the top 25 S&P companies’ CFOs 20 of the 25 finance chiefs are male. And Li will become the sixth female CFO in the top 25 when taking over in November.

Li will be at the helm of finance at a time when the company is laser-focused on the metaverse. In Q2 Meta reported its first revenue decline since going public a decade ago Fortune reported. Meta earned $28.15 billion in revenue for the second quarter down from $29.07 billion a year earlier. As the strategic partner to CEO Mark Zuckerberg age 38 Li will play a critical role in shaping and executing future metaverse investments.

Another CFO under the age of 40 in the technology sector is Tesla’s 37-year-old Zachary Kirkhorn aka the “Master of Coin.” While Tesla CEO Elon Musk is currently being sued by Twitter for terminating his $44 billion deal to buy the company and Musk spars with Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal about bots Kirkhorn has been managing Tesla’s balance sheet amid a crypto winter. The company announced in its recent Q2 earnings report it had sold 75% of its remaining Bitcoin. Kirkhorn became finance chief in 2019 helping the electric car company’s balance sheet by billions of dollars. He landed his first job out of school with McKinsey & Co. and joined Tesla Inc. while still in his mid-20s.

Here are the remaining Fortune 500 CFOs under the age of 40:

-Celso Goncalves Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. EVP and CFO 34

-Jessica Fischer Charter Communications Inc. CFO 35

-James P. Todd Landstar Systems Inc. VP principal accounting officer and CFO 35

Many of us have heard the recent news regarding Steel Dynamic’s (www.steeldynamics.com) investment in the aluminum mill project proposed for our area in Ashland Kentucky.

If Time magazine were a local magazine rather than a national publication then for better or for worse Craig Bouchard the original CEO on the project would probably make Time’s “Person of the Year” because of the attention that this project has garnered in the Tri- State.

Honestly the reason that this project received so much attention by our community is because producing metals was the lifeblood of the Tri-State for decades. Many of those steel producing jobs have disappeared in our area yet many of our skilled anxious-to-work craftsmen and offspring of those craftsmen remain.

Email newsletter signup

Because the project has been so high profile in the Tri-State area of Ohio Kentucky and West Virginia and because I have been somewhat close to the project since it began I feel like it is now time to outline how things have unfolded and where the project stands today.

I’ll write this outline in three parts: Braidy Unity and Steel Dynamics.

Braidy

The Braidy project was “for real.” It was not a way to “scam” our area or to “scam” the Commonwealth of Kentucky or intentionally give our citizens false hope.

Bouchard and his team had a real business model that made a lot of sense and was much needed in the metals industry and needed as part of the supply chain of America. That is why Craig was able to attract so many smart well-educated seasoned professionals in the aluminum industry as well as other professionals.

Many of those people believed so much in the Braidy model that they gave up successful lifetime careers to join Braidy and move their families to Ashland. Some of those wonderful people are still in our area working on the project and they bring a lot of social value and social diversity to our community. I know a number of these folks personally and they have given our community a “touch of class” that we did not have a few years ago.

Did the Braidy leadership get “out over their skis” a bit? Yes in my opinion.

Did the Braidy leadership not anticipate how long it would take to pull together funding for such a massive project? I think so.

Remember this was the first greenfield aluminum mill to be built in the United States in over 40 years. So obviously they did not have a model to go by. Did any of these employees of Braidy or Unity intentionally come to town to deceive the community or the Commonwealth? No way.

Unity

About two years ago Craig Bouchard was removed as CEO of Braidy by its board of directors. The board then hired Don Foster as a contract CEO. Don came to town and jumped into the project of trying to save the faltering startup.

Quickly the name of the project was changed from Braidy Industries to Unity Aluminum. Don brought with him decades of very successful work experience and fantastic contacts in the steel industry. Don stepped in with a lot of hard decisions to make to keep the project afloat.

The team that Braidy had assembled had a lot of very competent people on it. Although some of those folks given their skill sets were probably on staff “prematurely” given where the project was in its advancement at the time that Don took the reins. Once Don got the project temporarily stabilized he dusted off his Rolodex and began marketing to potential investors in this project with the contacts that he had — some of those in the steel industry.

If it had not been for Don Foster and the employees that he selected to stay behind and help this project would have certainly died like many locals thought that it already had.

Steel Dynamics

Don had a number of great contacts from his days in the steel industry and some of those contacts worked for Steel Dynamics which by the way is the third largest steel producer in the United States.

Steel Dynamics recently launched a press release announcing that they had committed to buy 94 percent of the Unity project. Their press release had to be carefully worded and approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) because Steel Dynamics is a publicly-held company and Wall Street has very strict rules when it comes to public announcements regarding mergers and acquisitions.

Steel Dynamics was somewhat limited by what they could and could not divulge in that release due to the SEC rules and the “quiet period” required by the SEC.

One of the things mentioned in this press release is that the former Braidy/Unity proposed plant location in Boyd/Greenup County Kentucky was not large enough for the new project and that a new site would be selected “somewhere in the southeastern United States.”

I do know that is true and I also know that the decision of where the new plant will be built has not yet been determined by Steel Dynamics. I want to see a project site selected by Steel Dynamics that will allow for the absolute best and most efficient plant performance regardless of which state Steel Dynamics selects for the location.

You can bet that the leadership of such an esteemed metals company will select only the most appropriate site for this venture.

In summary the Braidy project had exhausted its financing sources; had it not been for the board hiring Don Foster and Unity stepping in and getting the project on life support it would have been dead a couple of years ago.

Steel Dynamics stepping in and recently agreeing to buy the project saved all of the project investors (many being local) including the Commonwealth of Kentucky the probability of losing their investment.

As of today we do not know where the new aluminum mill will be built but regardless of which site is selected you can bet that the new site selection will be based upon sound business parameters; a location that will give the new mill and its employees the brightest future.

The fact that a world class company like Steel Dynamics bought the project tells me that the founders of Braidy had a great idea pursuing the new aluminum mill.

They just underestimated what it would take to raise the capital that they needed to get it off of the ground.

The 80-year-old med-tech giant said the new site and employees would help increase its leadership in additive manufacturing which plays a significant role in the healthcare sector as a means to produce sophisticated and customized medical parts.

Stryker’s Medical 3D Printing Hub

Located in the Anngrove neighborhood of County Cork the new high-tech facility shares grounds with the AMagine Institute Stryker’s global technology development hub and one of the world’s most extensive additive manufacturing facilities for orthopedic implants. Also considered one of the most advanced AM facilities in healthcare AMagine sees bright ideas transformed into exciting new implants for use in spinal surgery. In recent years it has developed breakthrough technologies from early research and development to full commercial launch and scaling.

Focused around its cornerstones the Tritanium PL posterior lumbar cages and C Cages for use in cervical interbody fusion procedures experts at AMagine optimize every property of the devices. Initially launched for hip and knee implants Stryker’s Tritanium technology has been proven throughout ten years of clinical experience with more than 300000 orthopedic devices implanted.

A Medical 3D Printing Behemoth

First established in Ireland in 1998 Stryker’s Irish presence includes more than 4000 people across eight facilities in Belfast Limerick and Cork comprising the company’s global Research & Development Innovation Centre and its European manufacturing headquarters. Furthermore the new site will add more potential to a growing number of AM applications. The company manufactures products to treat bone-related conditions across knees hips shoulder ankle craniomaxillofacial and spine as well as patient-specific solutions for people with significant disease progression often with no alternative.

For the last two decades Stryker has evolved its 3D printing processes to enable design freedom and rapid concept development. Much of its focus has been on evolving porous implants for orthopedics designed for bone in-growth and biological fixation. The company’s investment in AM began in 2001 and since then Stryker has collaborated with leading universities in Ireland and the UK to industrialize 3D printing for the healthcare industry. First investing in Concept Laser and Arcam machines Stryker decided to infuse $400 million in 2016 to develop its AMagine 3D printing facility in Cook which led to the development of its proprietary technology.

Stryker has made significant investments in Anngrove and says it will continue to invest for growth. To celebrate the official opening of the new high-tech facility the company received a visit from the prime minister and head of the Irish government Taoiseach Micheál Martin the Industrial Development Agency (IDA Ireland) and other local guests.

Medical 3D Printing Expands Globally

Commenting on the new facility Martin said: “I am delighted to be at the opening of Stryker’s newly expanded Anngrove facility a very welcome development for Cork and the South West region. Today’s opening and announcement of the capacity for new jobs is a testament to the capability dedication and vision of the Stryker team and of the growth and success of Stryker here. The government will work to ensure Ireland continues to be an attractive location for the med-tech sector and business in general supported by our highly-skilled and talented workforce.”

Similarly IDA Ireland’s CEO Martin Shanahan pointed out that Stryker’s expanded facility furthers the company’s four-decade commitment to Ireland and recognizes the robust ecosystem of universities engineering talent and partners such as the IDA.

The new facility “also builds on Stryker’s outstanding track record for innovation and shows the key role Anngrove plays in the company’s global additive technology research and development. We welcome this exciting development in Anngrove the potential it brings for future high tech job growth and look forward to continued success for Stryker in Ireland” highlighted Shanahan.

Through the new site Stryker’s expansion in Ireland is unquestionable. The company follows the steps of other renowned medical companies with an established foothold in the country. For example the Johnson & Johnson family of companies has been operating in Ireland for 80 years while multinational pharma and diagnostics healthcare powerhouse Roche has a commercial operation in Citywest Dublin and a manufacturing site in Clarecastle. Today Stryker is one of more than 20 of the world’s top biotech and pharma companies to have an established presence in Ireland.

And here is more about how the world’s biggest orthopedic companies are doing:

1. Stryker

With a strong order book for capital equipment and implant sales momentum Stryker (NYSE:SYK) recently boosted its revenue projections for 2022 predicting organic sales growth between 8% and 9% for the year. The world’s largest orthopedic device company however scaled back its earnings range amid the foreign currency exchange environment. Like most manufacturers Stryker said its supply chain is presenting challenges too.

“We continue to invest in R&D at a healthy ratio of sales demonstrating our continued focus on new product pipelines” CEO Kevin Lobo said during Stryker’s Q2 2022 earnings call on July 26. Company officials are also excited about the synergies that Stryker is already realizing from its $3.1 billion acquisition of Vocera Communications a provider of digital care coordination and communication offerings including the hands-free Vocera Smartbadge.

At DeviceTalks Boston in May four Stryker executives shared how the company thinks differently about medical product development and how health care providers and patients will ultimately use them.

2. Johnson & Johnson – DePuy Synthes

DePuy Synthes officials see the Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) business better enabling the personalization of orthopedic surgery creating better outcomes. That was a big takeaway when five J&J executives spoke about the shift toward digital at DeviceTalks Boston in May. “We’re not adopting technology just for technology’s sake. We’re adopting technology because it’s meeting clear unmet needs” said Rajit Kamal worldwide president sports medicine/shoulder reconstruction at DePuy Synthes.

Recent DePuy Synthes wins include the Inhance system receiving FDA clearance for total shoulder arthroplasty and adding the Cementless Fixed Bearing knee and Medial Stabilized knee to its Attune Knee portfolio. The company is betting it can compete in the ortho surgical robotics space with its Velys system which could help reduce the physical burden of orthopedic surgery. Earlier this year DePuy Synthes acquired Tennessee-based CrossRoads Extremity Systems and its range of procedure-specific sterile-packed implants and instrumentation systems cleared for lower extremity indications.

3. Zimmer Biomet

Zimmer Biomet (NYSE:ZBH) has had a great deal of news over the past year. It spun off its dental and spine business as ZimVie in March. ZB has also introduced new ortho surgical offerings based on AI and mixed reality. They are also pioneering smart ortho device implants being the first to offer smart knee implants.

In early August Zimmer Biomet reported second-quarter results that handily beat the consensus forecast on Wall Street upping its full-year forecast for 2022. A host of U.S. companies in medtech and other industries are reporting macroeconomic headwinds related to foreign exchange rates inflation supply chain challenges and more. ZB officials however appear to be making a bet that they can innovate their way out of rough economic seas. CEO Bryan Hanson pretty much said it during the company’s Q2 earnings call: “We believe our focus on innovation and the transformation of our business continues to position us well for long-term growth and continued delivery for our shareholders.”

4. Medtronic – Cranial & Spinal Technologies

In the spine space Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) had record quarters with its Mazor robotics system and StealthStation navigation system CEO Geoff Martha said during the medtech giant’s Q4 earnings call in May. “The ongoing launch of our Catalyft expandable titanium interbody system and the rollout of our enabling technologies continues to differentiate us in spine” Martha said. Recent spine wins for Medtronic include FDA 510(k) clearance and breakthrough device designation for its LigaPASS 2.0 ligament augmentation system for spine surgery and FDA clearance of its UNiD spine analyzer v4.0 planning platform. On the flip side the spine business was facing slowing distributor purchases in China ahead of a potential national volume-based tender as the Chinese government seeks to rein in healthcare costs.

5. Smith+Nephew

The most recent earnings report from Smith+Nephew (NYSE: SNN) showed an overall loss in revenue and its orthopedics business experienced a revenue decline of 1.1% in Q2 noting supply chain challenges and a new hip and knee volume-based procurement program in China. However company officials say they have a strategy to grow the orthopedics business.

“Orthopedics continues to be held back by execution and supply chain challenges” CEO Deepak Nath said in a recent earnings release. “In the last three months I have reviewed the business and together with the team we have developed a comprehensive plan to drive better execution at pace.”

The plan includes initiatives such as driving operational benefits in orthopedics and transforming the business. Smith+Nephew also recently invested in its orthopedics business by building a new $100 million manufacturing facility in Malaysia.

6. Enovis

Enovis (NYSE:ENOV) — the parent company of DJO Global — completed acquisitions and spinoffs this year to strengthen its position in the orthopedic device industry.

In May the company acquired assets of Outcome-Based Technologies‘ hip and knee bracing portfolio adding the Excyabir hip brace and CryoKnee knee braces to its DonJoy bracing brand.

Enovis also completed the acquisition of Insight Medical and its FDA-cleared Arvis augmented reality platform for hip and knee replacement surgery earlier this month.

In early August the company reported Q2 results that beat The Street on earnings but missed on revenue. It joined the host of medtech companies scaling back earnings projections for the year amid macroeconomic headwinds.

7. NuVasive

NuVasive (Nasdaq:NUVA) remains on track to grow its revenue more than 6% in fiscal 2022 and its orthopedic technology is expected to drive the growth. However the company reduced its EPS guidance in early August amid the macroeconomic pressures that many device companies presently face.

Early this year NuVasive announced that its Attrax Putty had received FDA 510(k) clearance for expanded indications in thoracolumbar interbody spine surgery. NuVasive officials say the Attrax Putty is the first synthetic bone graft with U.S. FDA indications for thoracolumbar interbody fusion. The company also describes Attrax as a relatively inexpensive biologic option. The spine surgery tech company in July released some positive data around Attrax and Modulus XLIF a porous titanium interbody implant when it came to lateral lumbar interbody fusions. Nuvasive said the fully porous architecture provided a favorable environment for bone in-growth and supported a less invasive XLIF procedure that was clinically and economically beneficial.

In April NuVasive reported successful data that demonstrated significantly greater success rates with its Simplify disc at the 24-month follow-up compared to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion when used for two-level cervical total disc replacement. The implant allows for enhanced visualization through MRI postoperatively compared to alternative devices.

8. Globus Medical

Globus Medical (NYSE:GMED) during its second quarter delivered on a needed rebound after a Q1 earnings miss and a surprise CEO transition said BTIG analyst Ryan Zimmerman as he kept his Buy rating on GMED shares. “To some extent investors are flying blind in terms of where GMED is heading longer-term strategically (and how it reaccelerates core spine) but at the same time we expect GMED to drive growth through competitive rep hires pull through from Enabling Technology and new product introductions; all of which are expected to pick-up as we move into FY23.”

Globus Medical reaffirmed its full-year 2022 guidance of $1.025 billion in net sales and non-GAAP EPS of $2.10.

The company reached another milestone in its business earlier this year with the first shipments of its Excelsius3D imaging system. Globus Medical announced the first procedures using the system in May. The mobile X-ray system is designed for 2D fluoroscopy 2D digital radiography and 3D imaging of adult and pediatric patients. When combined with its ExcelsiusGPS the image-guided robotic navigation improves implant placement accuracy.

Early feedback was “extremely positive” CEO Dan Scavilla said in May. He called the imaging system “an excellent example of Globus Medical’s innovation engine which will drive momentum and provide a platform for continued growth as we progress in 2022 and beyond.”

9. ZimVie (spine business)

Zimmer Biomet’s latest spinoff ZimVie (NYSE:ZBH) became an independent public company on March 1 nearly 13 months after Zimmer Biomet announced the move.

ZimVie reported $540 million worth of spine sales for calendar year 2021 while the spinoff’s other business — dental — did $469 million for the year.

CEO Vafa Jamali earlier this year said there are opportunities for growth in the spine space but the efforts could take years to accomplish. Two examples of the growth opportunity are cervical disc replacement and pediatric scoliosis treatments.

The former Medtronic executive also set his sights on “some operational issues to fix within our spine business” saying ZimVie would exit several countries where the business has been unprofitable.

“That opens up a ton of management time and energy. It just frees us up. … We’re doing a lot of work with our inventory and how we manage our sets. So this really gives us a chance to sort of stabilize and then to grow from there.” Jamali said. “We’re going to have a year of resetting and sorting out all these pieces. And then you’ll see us accelerate on some of the more innovation-focused areas and goals.”

Facing greater than anticipated foreign exchange headwinds ZimVie announced during its Q2 earnings report that it is reducing its full-year revenue forecast to $915 to $930 million versus prior guidance of $1 billion.

10. Orthofix

Orthofix (Nasdaq:OFIX) named Kimberley Elting as its global orthopedics business president in April. Eluting was previously chief legal and development officer and held other leadership roles in the areas of regulatory and quality business development and corporate communications at the orthopedic implant purveyor.

In May Orthofix said it received FDA premarket approval (PMA) for its AccelStim bone healing therapy device. In July the company announced a licensing partnership with LimaCorporate to combine the limb-lengthening technology of Orthofix’s Fitbone intramedullary nail system with LimaCorporate’s proprietary patient-specific 3D-printed pelvic fixation device. The company most recently launched its Virtuos Lyograft autograft substitute and marked the first clinical use.

The company in early August lowered its financial outlook for the year. It now anticipates fiscal 2022 net sales to be in the range of $455 million to $465 million down from its previous outlook of $475 million to $490 million.

Said CEO Jon Serbousek: “We had solid operational execution despite the challenges that macro headwinds continue to present including continued hospital staffing shortages complex spine procedure softness and patients deferring care due to economic pressures. In addition currency fluctuations during the quarter dampened reported revenue results.”

Speaking at the Space and Missile Defense Symposium in Huntsville Ala. Lt. Gen. Neil Thurgood head of the Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office said today the first battery of Directed Energy-Maneuver Short-Range Air Defense (DE M-SHORAD) will go to an air defense battery at Fort Sill Okla. in the next 45 days.

The DE M-SHORAD program one of the Army’s top 35 modernization priorities mounts a 50-kilowatt laser onto a Stryker vehicle. It’s designed to defend soldiers against drones from size group one (up to 20 pounds) through three (up to 1320 pounds) in addition to rockets mortars and artillery. Thurgood said during a presentation that the Army still has “a lot to learn” about directed energy but said the tactics techniques and procedures (TTPs) will largely remain the same.

“The TPPs for firing a laser are almost like the TPPs for firing a bullet” Thurgood said. “It’s just a bullet made out of light — that’s the only differences. The kill chain is the same.”

Thurgood said the DE M-SHORAD system has already participated in two live fire events. At the first live fire the platform was able to “track” mortar rounds but didn’t take them out. After six additional months of work the DE M-SHORAD program was able to defeat the mortars.

To better protect smaller infantry units Thurgood said that RCCTO recently kicked off a project to put a 20-kilowatt laser on an infantry squad vehicle a small troop transport that can carry nine soldiers. The new project called the Army Multi-Purpose High Energy Laser (AMP-HEL) will be delivered in FY2023.

The capabilities of the 20-kilowatt laser for AMP-HEL are more limited than its Stryker-mounted counterpart and can only defend against group one and two unmanned systems. Soldiers would still be vulnerable to group three drones and rockets artillery and mortars.

The Army is investing hundreds of millions of dollars in counter-unmanned aerial systems as the proliferation of low-cost drones threatens soldiers and installations both abroad and domestically. In conflicts abroad in just the last few years drones have been proven their effectiveness in delivering munitions on targets artillery spotting and other reconnaissance missions. In fiscal 2022 appropriations Congress gave the Army $434 million for counter-UAS efforts up from its budget request of $60 million.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueWNoZWFsdGhhbmRob3NwaXRhbHMub3JnL3ByZXNzcmVsZWFzZS9ueWMtaGVhbHRoLWhvc3BpdGFscy1lbG1odXJzdC1iZWdpbnMtcm9ib3RpYy1zdXJnZXJ5LWZvci1oaXAtYW5kLWtuZWUtcmVwbGFjZW1lbnRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NYC Health + Hospitals/Elmhurst Begins Robotic Surgery For Hip And Knee Replacements,"NYC Health + Hospitals/Elmhurst Begins Robotic Surgery For Hip And Knee Replacements

The Stryker Mako SmartRobotics system allows for faster recovery times and reduced pain and complications for total hip total knee and partial knee replacement patients

Aug 10 2022

NYC Health + Hospitals/Elmhurst announced today that it has acquired the Stryker Mako SmartRobotics system to perform robotic-assisted hip and knee replacement procedures. This new surgical option offers patients a minimally invasive alternative for total hip total knee and partial knee replacements. The highly advanced technology used in robotic surgery for joint replacement enables patients to recover faster and more effectively. NYC Health + Hospitals/Elmhurst which is accredited by The Joint Commission in Total Joint – Hip and Total Joint – Knee replacements is the first hospital within the NYC Health + Hospitals system to use to introduce the Mako robotic surgical procedure.

“NYC Health + Hospitals/Elmhurst is happy to be able to offer the Stryker Mako SmartRoboticssystem as an option for our patients” said NYC Health + Hospitals/Elmhurst CEO Helen Arteaga Landaverde MPH. “This demonstrates our commitment to providing the highest quality care to our orthopedic patients as well as our continuing efforts to embrace advanced technology so that our community has the care it needs and deserves.”

“The Mako robotic system which combines 3D CT-based planning with data analytics allows us to create a more personalized plan for each patient based on their unique anatomy before surgery” said Dr. Rohit Hasija Elmhurst’s Hip and Knee Program Director. “During surgery we can then confirm that plan and adjust if needed all the while guiding a surgical robotic-arm to perform that plan. We are thrilled to be able to offer these advanced techniques as part of the care we provide as we believe them to lead to better outcomes for total knee total hip and partial knee patients.”

Mako SmartRobotics is a treatment option designed to relieve the pain caused by joint degeneration due to osteoarthritis. During surgery the surgeon guides the robotic arm during bone preparation to execute the predetermined surgical plan and position the implant. Studies have shown that robotic-arm assisted joint replacement surgery leads to greater accuracy of implant position compared to manual partial joint replacement procedures. Other benefits for patients include less pain less need for opiate analgesics less need for inpatient physical therapy and a reduction in length of hospital stay.

Vanguard has been gradually rolling out a new option for the cash settlement sweep in your Vanguard Brokerage Account. The Vanguard Cash Deposit is FDIC-insured via partner banks and is currently available to select customers on an invitation-only basis:

Currently enrollment in the Vanguard Cash Deposit program is by invitation only to existing clients who have at least one Vanguard Brokerage Account. Mutual fund accounts 529s or other accounts are not eligible for Vanguard Cash Deposit.

Here is a quick comparison of the interest rates from the two available options:

Banking Partners (as of 8/10/2022)

Valley National Bank (FDIC cert. 9396)

NexBank (FDIC cert. 29209)

Synovus Bank (FDIC cert. 873)

Bank of Baroda (FDIC cert. 33681) (coming soon)

Synchrony Bank (FDIC cert. 27314) (coming soon)

Commentary. Vanguard’s existing cash sweep fund the Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund (VMFXX) already invests “at least 99.5% of its total assets in cash U.S. government securities and/or repurchase agreements that are collateralized solely by U.S. government securities or cash (collectively government securities).” In other words everything inside is also fully backed by the US government. I am a big fan of FDIC insurance but even I don’t lose any sleep at all about the safety of VMFXX not to mention I’ve found VMFXX historically tracks short-term interest rates quite well. As of this writing (8/10/22) VMFXX is yielding about 35 basis points more than the Cash Deposit sweep.

I don’t know if this new cash sweep option is in response to consumer demand or if it will serve as a profit source for Vanguard. I’m sure that some people out there will prefer having FDIC insurance even it means less interest income. (Be sure not to exceed the FDIC limits at any of the partner banks such as having separate account held there.) For now I’ll pass. If the Cash Deposit sweep does start earning a lot more I would consider switching.

If you wish to opt in to this option you can try to check if you are “invited” by visiting the product page clicking on “Choose Vanguard Cash Deposit” and logging into your Vanguard brokerage account.

SNPS,Synopsys,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vc2VtaWVuZ2luZWVyaW5nLmNvbS9jcnlvZ2VuaWMtY21vcy1iZWNvbWVzLWNvb2wv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cryogenic CMOS Becomes Cool,"Cryogenic CMOS is a technology on the cusp promising higher performance and lower power with no change in fabrication technology. The question now is whether it becomes viable and mainstream.

Technologies often appear to be just on the horizon not quite making it but never too far out of sight. That’s usually because some issue plagues it and the incentive is not big enough to solve the problem. If a solution were to be found possibly from another application domain it suddenly becomes a very viable technology. Add to that an increasing struggle to get viable scaling from Moore’s Law and the interest in cryogenic CMOS starts to rise as seen by a very rapid increase in research papers and funding in the technology.

Suman Datta professor at the University of Notre Dame moderated a panel session at DAC 2022 where he talked about the benefits of cooling CMOS. “When cooling transistors from 300 Kelvin to 77 Kelvin (-321°F/-196°C) the transistors improve in almost all respects (see figure 1). Leakage goes down the suppression slope improves mobility increases drive current increases. So really there are no negative things.”

Fig. 1. Improved transistor characteristics. Source: Suman Datta/University of Notre Dame

Datta also points out some less obvious gains such as increased reliability and similar benefits in the characteristics of wires where resistivity decreases while capacitance barely changes. All of this has been known since the 1980s when cooling a supercomputer in liquid nitrogen was shown to double its performance. The big question is whether the gains are worth the cost of cooling? “There are tremendous costs associated with cooling and a lot of logistical issues” says Datta.

So why is it receiving increased attention? The simple answer is that there are an increasing number of application areas for it including quantum computing.

The first panelist Effendi Leobandung from IBM Research started off by providing an explanation of Dennard’s theory (see figure 2.) “You can scale your voltage by a certain factor called ‘a’ because you scaled the dimensions by same factor. This also reduces the capacitance and the transistor diffusion so you don’t have as much short channel as before. Then you increase the dopant so that at the end you maintain the same power density. Everything went well until about maybe 65nm.”

Fig. 2. Dennard’s theory on CMOS scaling. Source: Effendi Leobandung (IBM)

At that point the voltage could not be scaled anymore because the threshold voltage couldn’t be changed and it becomes more difficult to increase performance. “Now we have a short channel problem” says Leobandung. “The suppression slope is proportional to temperature (kT). When the temperature goes down the subthreshold goes down. And when that goes down you can reduce the voltage which allows you to scale the gate oxide and then scale the gate length. This allows advanced technologies to continue to scale.”

This is where it becomes a lot more technical because in order to get the required characteristics at low temperatures the transistors have to be built differently. “The number one requirement is that the threshold voltage has to be negative at room temperature” says Leobandung. “One way to do that is to add more dopant. However in advanced devices like finFETs or gate-all-around there basically is no dopant and it has lower impact on threshold voltage. There are other ways to modify threshold slope that involve the dielectric interface and this is not modulated by temperature. This is through geometric-induced variation.”

Leobandung went on to talk about the some of the developments that are being looked at for finFETs and gate-all-around devices including new materials.

Ravi Pillarisetty senior device engineer for Intel talked about some of the ongoing work with RF ICs where the PDKs were modified for low-temperature operation. Once that was done the chips could be provide signals for control and readout on the qubits in a quantum computer. “We are trying to battle the cooling costs” he said. “In some sense we don’t necessarily care so much about the cooling costs because this is opening up a whole new paradigm of compute attacking unsolved problems that standard HPC cannot solve. But at the same time we are limited in terms of the raw cooling that these systems can provide.”

Pillarisetty provided a thermodynamic analysis of the cooling costs and said that while it is possible to build cooling systems with fairly high efficiency on a small scale it becomes a lot more problematic when you think about doing it for a data center. To break even Intel calculated devices would need to operate at about 0.3V but at that point new problems surface. “You really have to start worrying about things like variability noise margins and headroom. Is variation going to kill you? We see variation increases at low temperature. It’s not something where sigma is getting better. It’s always getting worse in basically every place we’ve seen.”

It has not been easy sailing. “As we start to scale up our test chips and just handle several hundred of these RF signals it’s becoming a very complex EDA problem” says Pillarisetty. “In fact our ability to scale up these chips is actually EDA limited. The EDA requirements for CPU GPU things that are standard digital design are very different from what we want here. Place and route needs to work for circuits operating at 20 GHz. We also really need to update the physics-based models to understand local heating on the device elements.”

Next up was Jamil Kawa fellow and group director for R&D at Synopsys. For the past five years he has been working on Josephson junction-based superconductor electronics. “I’ve been doing physical silicon measurements down to 77 Kelvin on a sub-7nm CMOS technology and I have drawn some practical conclusions. At 77 Kelvin liquid nitrogen CMOS as shown from our TCAD re-engineering of the device there is a 7X power advantage at iso-frequency or a 1.4X performance advantage in iso-power compared to room temperature. If you account for cooling costs which you have to that number drops to 4X. The optimal efficiency is somewhere between 100 K and 150 K.”

To gain all the benefits Synopsys had to re-engineer the device so the same technology node that was operating at 0.8 or 0.9 volts can now operate at 0.35 to 0.4 volts. These re-engineered devices are not able to operate at room temperature because they are always “on” and very leaky. Another issue they have to deal with is that below 200K the P devices become much stronger than N devices. That means that cell libraries need to be redesigned.

Kawa provided some diagrams that show the impact of variability as temperature decreases (see figure 3.) He particularly drew attention to the variability changes in the off-state current. In the lower left the blue shows leakage at 300 Kelvin the purple is at 77 Kelvin.

Kawa talked about the results from a test chip that contained ultra Vt standard Vt and low Vt devices that were purposely engineered for the slow-slow and fast-fast corners. “Performance for all practical purposes saturates at around 200 Kelvin even though gains in leakage continues almost linearly.”

With the completion of introductory remarks Datta asks the panelists if we should be looking at cryo-CMOS as a performance booster or an enabler of a new computing paradigm?

Kawa claimed a big bias for CMOS and Josephson junction-based superconductor technology. “We did a lot of automation at Synopsys to where we were able to certify our RTL-to-GDS flow for a 64-bit ARC processor with six blocks of memory. The area it consumed was prohibitive making it non-viable. CMOS is leaps and bounds ahead of other technologies in terms of density and there is still geometric scaling to go. Having said that I do believe strongly that we should explore every possible avenue especially for quantum computing applications.”

Leobandung felt that in the short term it was unlikely that any new technologies would be considered. “Our livelihood depends on being able to scale technology” he said. “In order to scale the markets you need to have a successful flow and I don’t see any other devices viably operating at low temperature.”

Pillarisetty had a longer-term view. “I am bullish on the long term basically looking at cryogenic beyond CMOS. We are going to need solutions in both spaces – one in the more traditional space but at the same time we have been working on beyond CMOS for a long time. Nothing beats silicon. We need to keep finding new ways to use silicon. But the important thing is to really understand the variation problem. We have to think about Pareto variation in the production technology. We almost have to do a full process run and measure variation on hundreds of wafers to really even look at all that data to see what’s happening. That has to be done in silicon technology and fully understood. Then we can try to understand what’s augmenting variation at low temperature and work on that.”

Many new technologies happen because money drives it. Datta asked if the industry could exploit the technology to the point where it could achieve 100X improvement in the energy-delay product at the performance level. This is the level at which he considered it to be a game changer.

Pillarisetty said that this would be a very tough goal. “In traditional CMOS the variation is going to work against you. And then there are electromagnetic effects. There’s no T on any of the Maxwell equations. Even with Josephson junction FETS or other sorts of novel superconducting type of devices they still have a Vt. There’s still some threshold and you still have variation.”

“Am I getting the picture now?” asked Datta. “You’re saying there’s no way I’m going to get a 0.3 volts cryo-CMOS with a conventional transistor device? The only way you can make this 100X gain in energy delays is not going to come from cold CMOS but it’s going to come from some exotic unknown technology.”

Leobandung said that we may have to look at the technology differently to get there. “One possible reason for the variation is that the technology is just not optimized for variation. It is a relatively high voltage technology. I’ve been working in the fab for a long time and I’m amazed sometimes what we can do about controlling what happened in the past. Once a problem is known it is possible to control your fabric. And while we may not get all the way there there may be a point where it is perhaps good enough. There’s still room to optimize.”

An audience member noted that while the panelists had mentioned some of the issues at the transistor level none of them commented on higher levels in a development flow. He asked what was happening with place-and-route and things like synthesis.

“When we tested our RTL to GDS flow we did not have to make major changes to the overall infrastructure” Kawa responded. “Timing closure and timing-driven place-and-route were challenging. Having said that I’ll be very blunt. If you want to take such technology in the future and make it a mainstream technology you need to invest in redesigning things from scratch. You need to do synthesis with superconductors in mind not start with existing tools.”

Kawa explained that while tools may need to be developed the industry can still build upon 35 to 40 years of experience with CMOS which is not the case if the industry were to switch to some exotic technology. “If you have a technology that is based on majority logic you cannot take an engine that’s optimized for CMOS logic (NAND NOR) and expect it to give you optimal mapping for majority gates” he said. “It is along those lines that engines need to be rewritten dedicated to new technologies.”

Another audience member questioned whether the direction of quantum computing would make an impact.

“If you think about different qubit types whether it’s a solid-state qubit whether it’s going to be spin qubits or quantum-dot based or even maybe photonic integrated circuits they would use the same kind of CMOS control chip and they would have to have the same kind of RF engineering and power delivery on the chip” Pillarisetty said. “If you look at a photonic IC that can be at higher temperature but there are other issues there. With ion trap systems everything’s at room temperature.”

A final question went back to the variation issue and its impact on memory. “While the transistors may look okay at 25mV when you use enough of them to make a memory it is not going to provide the necessary sigma” said Pillarisetty. “To make an SRAM I would need to crank it up to 250mV to 300mV to meet noise margins. If I have to crank the voltage that much then there’s no point doing it. Is there some smarter way to do this where you can maintain phase coherence in the circuit? That may allow you to get around the noise margins. You can ask is that quantum computing?”

Kawa added that cooling DRAM below 40K has some benefits because the refresh rate is lower thanks to the lower leakage.

Conclusion

Cryogenic CMOS appear to remain on the cusp. It is clear that it could provide significant benefit but to get all of the potential gains will take further investment. As of today nobody is willing to be the front runner. Quantum computing may result in cheaper cooling and it may provide a new and unique application for cryo-CMOS that may result in some of the issues becoming better understood and then solved. But none of this will be happening soon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaC5jby9uZXdzL2thc3BlcnNreS1wYXRjaGVkLXZ1bG5lcmFiaWxpdHktdnBu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kaspersky Has Patched a Serious Vulnerability in Its VPN,"Controversial security company Kaspersky is in headlines again for all the wrong reasons as it has just patched a serious vulnerability in its Secure Connection VPN that could’ve had some seriously negative implications for users.

Virtual reality is no longer just for gamers and as this technology is deployed in everything from health care to industrial training the requirements for processing more data faster over a high-speed connection are growing.

Designing these devices continues to be a study in contradictions. They must be extremely low power with a small enough batteries to make them comfortable to wear. But they also must be able to process large amounts of streaming image data in real time and with a screen refresh rate high enough to prevent motion sickness. In addition they must last long enough between charges to make it attractive to consumers. Also they must stay relatively cool because the device is worn over the face and they need to be secure include high-speed I/O and advanced communications technology — and still be affordable.

“VR applications require sophisticated and complex devices” said Ron Press director of Technology Enablement for the Tessent division of Siemens EDA. “To support the intense computing VR applications demand the devices need a lot of processing power. Thus devices for VR are often large with duplicate processors.”

In fact prior to the 7nm node VR pioneers commented that chip technology had not progressed enough to meet all of those goals. But as chips continue to scale and as they are architected into advanced packages with customized and heterogeneous compute elements there are enough performance and power improvements to make this technology much more useful for a variety of applications. That is borne out in the growth numbers. According to Allied Market Research the worldwide market for AR/VR chips is expected to reach $7.76 billion by 2026 worldwide.

One of the big drivers will be 5G connectivity which will enable faster download and upload speeds anywhere. Today most VR systems are wired and/or connected over Wi-Fi. But as these devices increasingly are untethered with 5G a variety of new applications will become possible including automotive architecture manufacturing digital marketing entertainment retail tourism and much more.

This opportunity has not been lost on systems companies and chipmakers. Leading technology companies involved with VR and VR chips include Apple AMD Broadcom HP Huawei Meta (Facebook) Microsoft NVIDIA Imagination Technologies Intel MEDIATEK Qualcomm and Samsung among others.

Different realities

Virtual reality is just one of several related technologies under development. While VR is by far the most recognized term it falls under the umbrella of extended reality (XR) which also includes augmented reality (AR) and a combination of both AR and VR called mixed reality (MR).

VR requires a head-mounted display (HMD) to experience a 3-D world generated by computer using video and audio signals. In contrast AR overlays computer-generated content on top of the real object often with clear glasses. AR can be used to train a technician to troubleshoot a machine. While the technician watches an augmented version of the real machine through the HMD AR images or video can guide the technician step-by-step through the repairs.

MR as the term suggests mixes certain VR and AR elements. This hybrid model makes it possible for the digital and physical world to appear as one integrated 3-D environment. Potentially as MR matures the user can interact with the physical world digitally.

A new term “the metaverse” has recently emerged to mean cyberspace or the digital world. It can be accessed through VR or AR.

In June 2022 the 1000+ member Metaverse Standards Forum announced for the first time the development of open standards for the metaverse. Membership for joining the organization is currently free. One of its goals is to encourage collaboration on spatial computing. Such collaboration in areas such as interactive 3D graphics geospatial systems physical simulation and photorealistic content authoring will energize the growth of VR technology.

Designing a VR system

VR systems combine 3-D software and various types of sensors including those used for motion audio and video as well as an HMI/user interface. Design considerations include force feedback conductivity low power and being compact and light enough to wear. Selecting the right chips and components for the design is important.

“Regarding SoC selection it depends on the targeted end-product” said Amol Borkar director of product management marketing and business development for Cadence‘s Tensilica Vision and AI DSPs. “For making prototypes or manufacturing in small volume there isn’t enough business justification to build an SoC in-house. This rule of thumb applies to vendors building headsets that are usually tethered to a phone or computer. They might be building an all-in-one headset where the main compute inside is still an application processor (AP) running on an Android or a Linux OS variant. In this case many high-performance off-the-shelf SoCs (or chiplets) with integrated GPUs and vector DSPs may suffice. Vendors can fabricate the circuit boards and interface with various sensors. There have been a number of designs by well-known vendors that are shipping products using such components.”

However for companies heavily invested in VR the trend is to build their own SoCs or systems-in-package. “Building in-house gives the vendor the freedom to design the hardware to match the specs and the KPIs to create a compelling solution” Borkar said. “In such cases there may be custom MCUs or DSPs that offload various portions of SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) for high performance and low energy consumption. That approach lets the GPU mostly focus on display and rendering while the main CPU concentrates on housekeeping tasks. These companies then also develop the software stacks SDKs and framework to leverage all these components. This results in a rich ecosystem that enables developers to build high-quality applications creating great user experiences.”

Over the past several years significant advances in data compression makes it easier to move large amounts of data more quickly. “Using VESA DSC and VDC-M video compression enables AR/VR SoC designers to reduce video buffer size and video interface bandwidth leading to significant power savings lower EMI and a smaller footprint — all while keeping latency extremely low” said Simon Bussières director of systems architecture at Rambus. “VESA DSC and VDC-M are visually lossless compression codecs meaning that when used the human eye detects no perceptible difference. Both codecs have been rigorously tested and in 2021 additional research conducted by VESA validated the visually lossless performance of both codecs for stereoscopic 3D use cases including for AR/VR applications.”

Perhaps the most challenging part is user interface and navigation. Users need freedom of movement ease of control and system responsiveness. Also the HMD must be comfortable to wear without strain on the human body and it has to have enough performance to prevent the user from becoming nauseous. The device input can be challenging because it involves multiple formats such as voice gesture click and haptics. Fortunately for industrial and commercial applications the motion sickness issue is minimal as users move around less than they do for gaming.

For years VR developers have used discrete components such as MCUs various sensors different wireless connection chips and DSPs to get the job done. Recently multiple functions are integrated into fewer chips. For example Qualcomm has developed the Snapdragon XR2 5G Platform which supports 5G 8K 360° video 7 concurrent cameras and AI all in one chip.

Security issues

Security is another consideration. No matter how a VR device is connected that connection makes it vulnerable to attack. Hackers potentially can use the HMD or VR devices as gateways to both home networks and enterprise systems/networks. Once the link has been established hackers can steal private data and information. Security experts warn against hackers driving by the neighborhood to hack Wi-Fi routers. But with 5G hackers can launch an attack anytime anywhere which increases the vulnerability systems.

“VR provides new ways to visualize data and in many cases is more portable and provides more connectivity options than traditional displays” said Mike Borza scientist and principal security technologist at Synopsys. “For many consumer uses the security concerns pertain mostly to privacy. When used in an enterprise context there can be many security concerns such as the protection of proprietary intellectual property and data (such as design models of manufactured products). When used interactively as part of a human-machine interface there are concerns about protection of the integrity and availability of data while maintaining low overall latency for precise control (e.g. an operator remotely controlling machinery). And in many other applications that are emerging in spaces with confidentiality there are issues involving privacy and governance requirements (e.g. healthcare).”

Security experts warn about the importance of cybersecurity. “Like any other connected system virtual reality systems can be a target for cyber threats” said Steve Hanna distinguished engineer at Infineon Technologies. “Protection falls into two categories — protocol security and product security. Protocol security protects data while it’s in transmission. For example data sent to and from a VR headset should be encrypted and authenticated to protect confidentiality and ensure authenticity of the data. Product security protects the system from being hacked. For example secure boot verifies that only authorized firmware can run on a VR headset. Without product security protection a compromised headset could infect a laptop or vice versa.”

That connectivity becomes more vulnerable to attack as these devices become more mobile. “Connectivity today is wired (mostly high-bandwidth USB Type C) or Wi-Fi” said Borza. “Future Bluetooth versions will have the bandwidth to support these devices. Depending on the connectivity model link-layer security will be sufficient when a one-to-one correspondence between the VR device and the data source exists. But in many cases the end-to-end security model makes much more sense particularly when VR is used to view and interact with remote entities. So we can expect to see a need for high-bandwidth IPsec and TLS secure communications.”

Others point to similar needs. “To safeguard VR with 5G capability it is important to deploy end-to-end security” said Gijs Willemse senior director of Product Management at Rambus. “5G security goes beyond man-in-the-middle and side-channel attacks. You are now also dealing with a potential attack against your (cloud) services over the network. In addition to designing with security software/chips the VR implementation will need to consider access to personal and private data as well as advanced firmware updates device and user authentication and potentially real-time payments.”

Design tradeoffs

As VR is deployed across different markets and use cases it is clear that one size will not fit all. For high-speed gaming competition in this market has been all about processing speed and latency. For a surgical training application in contrast clarity and accuracy are the priorities. An 8K display with force feedback that gives the surgeon the feeling of doing a real operation on a live person is most helpful.

Once the VR design goals are set the next step is to establish the most suitable test method model or simulation to ensure all the parameters meet the goals.

“One common metric is motion-to-photon (MTP) latency” said Cadence’s Borkar. “MTP measures the time or latency from when a movement occurs to when it is rendered and displayed on the headset’s screen. There are a number of variants to this metric but the overall idea is the same for most with the target range being 15 to 20 ms or less for a good VR experience. This is an important metric as the VR experience is a complicated ‘stack’ going from the camera/IMU sensor to the system bus followed by SLAM processing rendering display and more. Each phase of the process contributes latencies. However to help reach the performance target clever tricks can come into play at the various stages. For example SLAM may use only IMU data for some frames to improve the refresh rate as cameras are usually 30 to 60 fps. GPUs may use timewarps and spacewarps to render intermediate frames and prevent stalling the pipeline.”

On the test side tools are being introduced to to target VR technology. “Recently there has been wide adoption of packetized scan pattern delivery using for example the Siemens Tessent TestKompress Streaming Scan Network (SSN) technology for advanced devices such as VR” said Siemens’ Press. “Instead of testing duplicate cores individually or trying to time a broadcast to all cores it delivers the same packet skewed in time to them with an on-chip comparator inside each core. As a result any number of identical cores can be tested without extending test time or taking more test development time. What is also unique to packetized scan pattern delivery is that as test requirements change the cores selected to be tested in parallel can be optimized on the fly. This provides a lot of flexibility. As these VR designs evolve the test patterns and solutions for cores can be completed then the cores to test in parallel can be selected later. Once the cores are selected the packetized data is processed to provide the patterns to the selected cores in an optimized way that is dramatically more efficient than traditional approaches.”

Conclusion

VR challenges include integration of many design parameters and safeguarding cybersecurity threats. Although they may vary depending upon the application the parameters typically include software/hardware optimization selection of VR chips or SoC power management HMI packaging performance and testing/simulation. It is important to clearly define the design goals. Additionally to minimize the risks of cyber threats VR systems must incorporate the latest security technologies and know-how.

VR and related technologies will continue to improve. New applications will emerge. In a recent experiment “HoloScenarios” allowed medical students by wearing the Microsoft HoloLens mixed reality headsets to interact with a multi-layered medically accurate holographic patient. Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (CUH) in the UK in partnership with the University of Cambridge (Cambridge UK) and tech company GigXR in Los Angeles developed the project which increases learning opportunities for medical students.

There will be many more such applications over the next decade as people learn how to apply this technology. After a long wait and lots of promises the virtual world is beginning to take shape.

While most people are familiar with using machine learning and deep learning to distinguish between cats and dogs emerging applications show how this capability can be used differently. Data prioritization and partitioning for example can be utilized to optimize power and performance of a chip or system with no human intervention. And various flavors of AI can be used throughout the design and manufacturing flows to catch errors or flaws that humans cannot. But all of these new components and functions also make designing chips more complex even at more mature nodes as probabilities replace finite answers and the number of variables increases.

“As you move AI out to the edge the edge starts to look like the data center” said Frank Ferro senior director of product management at Rambus. “There’s the baseband which is doing a lot of the same processing function. And similarly on the memory requirements we’re seeing a lot of 5G customers running out of bandwidth and looking to HBM at the edge of the network. But instead of going to the cloud there is more configurability in the network and you can manage the workloads. Balancing those workloads is very important.”

Still nothing in the AI world is simple as AI chip designers have learned. “In an AI design there are many questions to be answered” said Ron Lowman strategic marketing manager at Synopsys. “What algorithm are you trying to process? What is your power budget? What accuracy are you trying to achieve? In an image recognition application you may not need a 32-bit floating-point processor. A lower-cost 16-bit image chip may do just fine. If a 92% accuracy is all you need a low-cost chip may cut down your overall budget. If you know what you want to achieve taking the IP approach will have a great deal of advantages. You can select the right AI processors right kind of memory (SRAM or DDR) I/O and security. Selecting the right IP is important but doing the modeling and benchmarking also will help developers to optimize the AI solutions and reduce errors.”

Design challenges can add up very quickly for any advanced chips and more variables require better models more process steps and more time. “You start from a very complex idea of what the chip is going to be performing and then you see if there are different requirements for different parts of the chip” said Roland Jancke design methodology head in Fraunhofer IIS’ Engineering of Adaptive Systems Division. “In the past you would just design something develop it and tape it out and see whether it works or not. That’s no longer feasible. You need really an integrated process. From the very beginning you need to think about what are possible failure modes. And you even need to start with with maybe finite element methods for simulation at the very beginning which typically has not been done in the past where you start with very rough models with functionality that you want to integrate. So if you have a MATLAB model that does not reflect the physical interaction between the different parts of the chip. You need to integrate different models early in the development process — physical models functional models — to see whether your concept is going to be functional enough.”

That becomes harder with more moving pieces particularly when those pieces are customized or semi-customized for specific data types and use cases. But the upside is that better algorithms and compute elements also allow more data to be processed within a much smaller footprint and with far less power than in past implementations. That in turn enables the processing to occur much closer to the sources of data where it can be used to determine which data is important where that data should be processed at any particular point in time and which data can be discarded.

A tipping point

Most of these changes by themselves are incremental and evolutionary but collectively they enable inferencing and training across the edge where a spectrum of heterogeneous architectures are beginning to emerge. By leveraging various types of neural networks processing can be speeded up for targeted purposes with varying levels of accuracy and precision for different applications.

For any AI chips that perform complex algorithmic and computations there are several key requirements. First they need to be able to process data in parallel using multiple compute elements and wide data paths to reduce latency. In many cases that also involves some localized memory in close proximity to compute elements as well as high-bandwidth memory. Second these devices need to be optimized for size cost and power budgets which often requires high-throughput architectures that are sized according to projected workloads. That in turn requires a number of tradeoffs which need to be balanced for the particular use case. And third these architectures often involve a mix of processors to manage complex data flows and power management schemes which can include CPUs GPUs FPGAs eFPGAs DSPs NPUs TPUs and IPUs.

“In design developers need to consider the requirements of training inferencing low power connectivity and security” said Danny Watson principal software product marketing manager for Infineon’s IoT Wireless and Compute Business Unit “This approach enables new use cases that need local fast decisions while meeting the power budget of today’s IoT products.” Watson noted that the key is collecting the right data so applications can capitalize on that it allowing them to take leverage technology improvements.

AI everywhere.

For chip companies this is all a very big deal. According to the latest report by Precedence Research the AI market as a whole will grow from $87 billion in 2021 to more than $1.6 trillion by 2030. That includes data centers as well as edge devices but the pace of growth is significant. In fact AI is such a hot field today that almost every major tech company is investing in or making AI chips. They include Apple AMD Arm Baidu Google Graphcore Huawei IBM Intel Meta NVIDIA Qualcomm Samsung and TSMC. The list goes on and on.

This market barely existed five years ago and a decade ago most companies were thinking in terms of cloud computing and high-speed gateways. But as new devices are rolled out with more sensors — whether that’s cars smart phones or even appliances with some level of intelligence built into them — so much data is being generated that it requires architectures to be devised around the input processing movement and storage of that data. That can happen on multiple levels.

“In AI applications various techniques are being deployed” said Paul Graykowski senior technical marketing manager at Arteris IP. “A recent customer has developed a complex multi-channel ADAS SoC that can handle four channels of sensor data each with its own dedicated compute and AI engine to process the data. Similarly new AI chip architectures will continue to change to meet the requirements of new applications.”

From big to small

Time to results is usually proportional to distance and shorter distances mean better performance and lower power. So while massive datasets still need to be crunched by hyperscale data centers there is a concerted effort by the chip industry to move more processing downstream whether that’s machine learning deep learning or some other AI variant.

Cerebras is the poster-child in the deep-learning world where speed is critical followed closely by accuracy of results. Natalia Vassilieva product management director at Cerebras reported that GlaxoSmithKline has increased its drug discovery efficiency by using its wafer-scale device in its Epigenomic Language Models. In one scenario GlaxoSmithKline was able to reduce the deep neural network-based virtual screening time for a large library of compounds from 183 days running on a GPU cluster to 3.5 days on the Cerebras device. That “chip” has more than 2.6 trillion transistors 850000 AI optimized cores 40 GB of on-chip memory and a memory bandwidth of 20 PB per second (one petabyte equals 1024 terabytes). It also consumes 23 kW of power and uses internal closed-loop direct-to-chip liquid cooling.

Graphcore took a different approach by introducing an intelligence processing unit (IPU) technology. By using multiple-instruction multiple-data (MIMD) parallelism and local distributed memory the IPU can deliver 22.4 PFLOPS (1 petaflop per second equals 1000 teraflop per second) while only air cooling is needed. Additionally the IPU has a theoretical arithmetic throughput of up to 31.1 TFLOPS in single precision. It is much faster than the A100’s 624 TFLOPS. In one test conducted by Twitter the IPU outperformed the GPU.

AI also can go small. AI-enabled smart things also known as the artificial intelligence of things (AIoT)/embedded AI are flourishing. According to Valuates Reports edge AI hardware will grow from $7 billion in 2020 to $39 billion in 2030. AI has added intelligence to edge computing network end points and mobile devices. Along with the IoT more and more applications are using embedded AI. Among their number are wearables smart homes and smart remote controls including some that use voice recognition. Also relying on embedded AI are AR/VR gaming smart automotive panels object and movement detection home health care meter reading smart factories smart cities industrial automation and smart buildings including control and energy management. The list goes on limited only by one’s imagination.

“AI will make IoT computing more efficient with its ability to process data faster locally” said Suhas Mitra product marketing director for Tensilica AI products at Cadence. “This includes providing better response time and smaller latencies since data being generated is also processed on the edge device instantly. Executing AI edge processing will be more reliable since it may not always be possible to send a massive amount of data via a live wireless or wired connection to the cloud constantly. It also relieves the pressure of storing and processing enormous amounts of data in the cloud which could contain personal and sensitive information. Privacy concerns about sending user information to the cloud may make it impossible to upstream data regardless of consent. Doing more edge computing extends the battery life as some of the compute requires fewer cycles on the edge platform when using AI approaches. As a result less energy is consumed and heat dissipation is lower.”

All AI chips need to be trained before inferencing can take place. While the datasets are often so large that they require a large data center to train further training can be done at the personal computer or development system level. Developers will go through a painstaking process to ensure an optimal inference algorithm is achieved. Many AI chip manufacturers furnish a list of training partners for their customers. Even with consultants’ help developers still have to pay for the consulting time and go through the training effort.

An easier way to do this is to implement with pre-trained models such as Flex Logix’s EasyVision platform. “With the pre-trained X1M chip for modules developers can bypass the training process and go directly to product development and test” said Sam Fuller senior director of inference marketing at Flex Logix. “The pre-trained solutions have been field-tested and proven which is much more efficient than developers’ trial-and-error approach. Often the dedicated pre-trained chip is much more efficient than regular CPUs.”

Thinking even smaller

The possibilities for including AI in even smaller devices are growing as well thanks to tiny machine learning established by the tinyML Foundation to support embedded on-device ML and data analysis operating in the mW range. Many of these devices can perform ML in vision audio inertial measurement unit (IMU) biomedical. Additionally it provides an Open-Source Neural Network Optimization framework called ScaleDown to simplify deploying ML models to tinyML devices.

TinyML can run on any programmable AI chips including Arduino boards. The mission of Arduino has been to provide electronic devices and software to hobbyists students and educators. It has evolved over the years and solutions based on Arduino are used in many industrial segments today. But combining tinyML and Arduino hardware can potentially provide very low-cost embedded AI solutions. Typical hardware costs less than $100.

One of the challenges of designing AI into these tiny devices is power budgeting. Synaptics has taken on the challenge to develop low-power-budget AI and sensor chips. According to Ananda Roy senior product manager leading the low-power AI product line at Synaptics the company’s Katana AI SoC is capable of people detection/counting and fall detection and can run active AI vision inferencing with 30 mW at 24 MHz or higher power at 90 MHz. Deep Sleep mode consumes less than 100 µW. Overall it is much more power efficient than other AI chips. To achieve efficient power management the neural processing unit (NPU) relies on a memory architecture with multiple memory banks that can be set to ultra-low power modes when not in use and scalable operating voltage and processor-speed much like stepping on the gas when you need your car to go faster.

FlexSense a sensor chip for AI applications was designed combining a low-power RISC CPU with an analog hardware front end that is highly optimized for efficient conversion of the inductive and capacitive sensor inputs. Together with the on-board Hall effect and temperature sensors it comprises four sensors to detect inputs such as touch force proximity and temperature all in one small package (1.62 x 1.62 mm) using only 240 µW or 10 µW in sleep mode. Traditional designs would require four ICs.

Security issues and improvements

When it comes to security AI is both a potential vulnerability and a potential solution. As AI chips are optimized for specific use cases and as the algorithms are updated the industry’s learnings decrease and the attack surface widens. But AI also can be used to identify unusual patterns in data traffic sending out alerts or autonomously shutting down affected circuits until more analysis can be done.

Srikanth Jagannathan product manager at NXP pointed out the importance of having the right mixture of functions chip security and low power for battery operated devices. The i.MX AI chip combines Arm’s lower-power Cortex-M33 with the Arm TrustZone and NXP’s on-chip EdgeLock embedded ML and multiple I/Os. Power consumption is expected to be less than 2.5 watts. Yet it is able to deliver performance of 0.5 TOPS (512 parallel multiply-accumulate operations at 1 GHz).

Kathy Tufto senior product manager in Siemens EDA’s Embedded Software Division pointed to the need for establishing a software chain of trust but noted that starts from the hardware. The goal is to prevent any code that hasn’t been authenticated and validated from executing. Among the solutions she identified:

Data at Rest – Secure boot root of trust and Software chain of trust access control.

Data at Motion – Security protocols and Crypto acceleration.

Data at Use – Hardware-enforced separation through Memory Management Unit (MMU).

“Device manufacturers must also keep in mind that security issues commonly arise after devices are deployed which means they need to design their devices in a way that they can be updated after they have been deployed” Tufto said. “Regulatory bodies including the FDA are insisting on a strategy of managing CVEs both pre- and post-release to satisfy security requirements for medical devices. Common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) monitoring is a process where new CVEs are evaluated against the modules in the device allowing the device manufacturer to determine appropriate action when new CVEs are found. While a manufacturer can perform these activities itself it is simpler and easier if you use a commercial software solution that includes security vulnerability monitoring and patches such as Sokol Flex OS Sokol Omni OS and Nucleus RTOS.”

Conclusion

AI chips will continue to evolve and scale and AI will be used in multiple ways both within those chips and by those chips. That will make it more difficult to design those chips and it will make it harder to ensure they work as expected throughout their lifetimes both from a functional and a security standpoint. It will take time to see which benefits outweigh the risks.

While developers continue to develop AI to emulate the human brain but they are a long way from a device that actually can think for itself. Nevertheless there are many ways to optimize these systems for specific use cases and applications and not all of them require human intervention. As time goes on that will likely mean more AI in more places to do more things and it will raise design challenges involving power performance and security that are both difficult to plan for to identify and ultimately to fix.",,,

Their strategy was underlined in an analysis from left-leaning watchdog Accountable.US on Wednesday which pointed to positive financial results for food companies including Sysco Corp. Kellogg Co. Starbucks Corp. Kraft Heinz Co. and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. in recent months. Those results came even as consumers faced food prices that climbed 10.9% compared to a year ago the most since 1979 according to inflation figures released Wednesday.

The Accountable.US report was shared first with Bloomberg Government and compiled by a group run by former staffers for progressive causes and lawmakers. It’s meant to bolster Democratic arguments that consumers’ pricing pain is the fault of profit-seeking corporations — not government spending as Republicans have claimed.

“The same corporations that trumpet massive new profits and giveaways to their wealthy investors suggest they somehow had no choice but to inflate prices so high” Accountable.US spokesperson Liz Zelnick said.

Economists on both sides of the aisle have cast doubt on the arguments instead pointing to the myriad drivers of high inflation including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and pandemic-related supply chain concerns — while disagreeing on the role of consolidation.

Still Democratic lawmakers have leaned into arguments that they can curb inflation through antitrust policies — if only voters turn up for them in the midterms. And some polling shows such “greedflation” factors are a compelling explanation for voters — especially for Democrats but also for some Republicans and independents.

“The Republican playbook same as it’s always been: cut taxes for the richest Americans cut regulations on the giant businesses that cheat people and slow down the spending on families that actually need some help” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said at a press conference last month urging Congress to pass antitrust measures such as S. 4214 a bill she sponsored that would make price gouging a federal crime.

“We have other ideas on the Democratic side and we started today with ‘end the price-gouging’” Warren said. “That’s something we can do if voters will help us out in November.”

Calls to Voters

Overall Wednesday’s data showed prices in July rose 8.5% from a year before slowing down from the previous month but still above historical averages.

Democrats seeking to target companies’ price-gouging have focused in part on widespread consolidation in the food industry where the production of goods from beef to dry pasta is controlled by a few big companies exacerbating any price pressures.

“The only winners in this massive food system which is making incredible profits are the consolidated multinational companies that dominate this industry and they’ve turned it into an oligopoly” said Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.).

Inflation has factored in as a significant drag on Democrats as they look to retain control of Congress. A Fox News poll conducted in July by Democratic firm Beacon Research and GOP outfit Shaw & Company Research found 31% — a plurality — of 1000 registered voters blamed the Biden administration the most for high gasoline prices. Less than half that or 14% of people in the same survey pointed the finger at profiteering or price-gouging in the private sector.

But polling by left-leaning firms outlines the messaging push to divert blame to corporations. Progressive firm Data for Progress in May asked 1146 likely voters a series of questions about large corporations before gauging them on those companies’ impacts on inflation. Democrats were subsequently more inclined to blame inflation on corporations “taking advantage of the pandemic” to increase profit. The same survey showed more than half of independents and Republicans agreed with that argument.

“There is actually a fairly persuasive story that unites people both living in cities and rural areas” Data for Progress senior analyst Ethan Winter said.

Earnings Evidence

Watchdog group Accountable.US points to executives’ remarks on earnings calls as evidence that food companies are using inflation as an excuse to set prices higher than necessary.

The five companies mentioned didn’t respond to requests for comment on the accusations.

“There’s no better time than the current hyperinflationary environment to have a strategic pricing tool and we’re leveraging it to our advantage” Sysco CEO Kevin Hourican said on a May earnings call cited by the group. Sysco this week also reported higher earnings and sales for its fourth quarter.

Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz also said last week during a third-quarter earnings call that the company isn’t seeing a significant reduction in customer spending due to inflation and praised its “pricing power.” Accountable.US said the remarks coupled with the company’s record quarterly revenues of $8.2 billion up 9% from the previous year highlight how major food companies are profiting while consumers struggle higher prices.

“The food industry’s hunger for record-high profits has come at the unreasonable expense of everyday families” said Zelnick the group’s spokesperson urging the passage of Democrats’ climate and tax bill (H.R. 5376). The House is scheduled to pass the partisan measure on Friday.

Once enacted it would impose an excise tax on corporate stock buybacks — which Democrats say would help assuage rising prices for consumers by curbing “greedflation” from large companies.

Role of ‘Greedflation’

Democrats have sought to target corporations more explicitly with other legislation. In the House vulnerable Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger (Va.) led a package of legislation billed the Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act (H.R. 7606) which the chamber passed in June.

The package would set up an investigator’s office in the meat and poultry sector to weed out anticompetitive actions which Spanberger argued would bring down prices for consumers.

Though seven Republican voted for the legislation others in the party shot down the connection between market competition and inflation.

“The crisis we are facing cannot be mitigated with unfunded mandates duplicative authorities polarized agencies and big government” said Rep. Glenn ‘GT’ Thompson (R-Pa.) the ranking member on the House Agriculture Committee.

Tyson Foods Inc. which wasn’t mentioned in the Accountable.US report threw a wrench in the “greedflation” argument with its lackluster earnings reported earlier this week. The biggest US meat company is one of the four major meatpackers in an industry under congressional scrutiny for allegations of anticompetitive behaviors which all the packers have denied.

Tyson said in the earnings report that “inflationary market conditions” such as supply chain issues and labor costs hurt its quarterly performance.

Impact of Policies

“Inflation does not impact all sectors equally and at the same time” with some businesses getting a temporary bump from inflation said Joel Griffith a research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. “But over time this impacts not just consumers it will impact businesses as well.”

He added that some food and energy companies are seeing higher profits because they’re tied to commodity prices which have been soaring over the past year.

The Democrats’ party-line spending bill could cut inflation years down the line by making the US more of a leader in green energy technology and increasing taxes Berkeley antitrust economist Aaron Edlin said — but not in the immediate future.

Though antitrust actions could lower prices somewhat in specific markets Edlin who served on the Council of Economic Advisers in the Clinton White House said high global inflation isn’t due to corporate consolidation. “It’s not plausible that if we have much stricter antitrust enforcement over the next year that’s going to make a meaningful dent in inflation” he said.

Federal Reserve policies are the major cause of rising inflation according to Christopher Thornberg the founder of research group Beacon Economics. “It’s ridiculous to claim that inflation is being driven by corporations” he said.

Still Thornberg said Republicans aren’t looking in the right places to lower prices either. He said the GOP “opened up the spigot” of stimulus spending that contributed to rising prices.

“Every time you have a bout of inflation everybody runs around trying to find scapegoats” Thornberg said. “And this is just one of those scapegoats.”

The programme will see children given the opportunity to spend a day at the seaside or visit attractions including Go Ape and the Yorkshire Sculpture Park.

The charity will also partner with Unilever to provide free Wall’s ice creams to children as part of the scheme.

It comes as Meals & More said it had experienced its most challenging summer since it was founded in 2015 with over 200000 meals being provided by the charity as families face rising food and energy bills.

Brakes which is part of Sysco GB recently commited a further £500000 to the charity in order to help it achieve its goals.

“While the pandemic was challenging we’ve reached an entirely new level with families really suffering with the unexpected rise in household costs and food” said Kate Woodhouse chair of trustees for Meals & More.

“We had hoped that the increased government support would help address the issue of holiday hunger but unfortunately we are seeing more and more children and their families being dragged into poverty.”

Sysco GB HR director Margaret Gooch said: “It’s heartbreaking to see so much need in the country and we are delighted to be helping Meals & More as it provides support to address some of the issues that are impacting young people and families today.

“Sysco’s mission is ‘Connecting the World to share food and care for one another’ and Meals & More is a fundamental part of that.”",,,

The company’s EBITDA is now expected to reach around $38 billion (€37 billion) up from the previous guidance of more than $37.8 billion (€36.6 billion). DT attributed the rise to the positive development of business at T-Mobile US as well as strong performance outside the U.S.

DT executives praised the record subscriber growth at T-Mobile in the second quarter 2022 noting that mobile postpaid net additions were the best-ever customer growth in a second quarter and more than AT&T’s and Verizon’s sub growth combined.

DT said that thanks to the fact the integration of Sprint has continued to progress well and rapidly T-Mobile US is raising its guidance for the synergies from the business combination to between $5.4 billion - $5.6 billion in 2022 up from the previous range of between $5.2 billion - $5.4 billion.

It predicts the number of postpaid customers at T-Mobile US to increase by 6 million - 6.3 million around 600000 net additions more than were expected after the end of the first quarter.

DT Chief Executive Timotheus Hoettgas said buying the majority stake in T-Mobile US was the group's most important strategic project at present according to Reuters. He said that stake should top 50% much sooner than its previous projection of 2024.

Earlier this year DT paid $2.4 billion to SoftBank Group to increase its stake in T-Mobile US to 48.4%.

Towers

During the quarter Deutsche Telekom also announced the sale of a 51% stake in GD Towers — its cell tower business in Germany and Austria — to DigitalBridge and Brookfield. DT said today that GD Towers has 40700 cell sites.

DT has previously said that the tower portfolio is valued at $17.5 billion. It expects to receive $10.7 billion in cash including debt of $4.1 billion from the deal with DigitalBridge and Brookfield. Deutsche Telekom will retain its 49% stake in GD Towers maintaining exposure to future value

Anyone with savings that have moved from prior recordkeepers to TIAA can now view and make changes to all transferred balances within the new accounts at TIAA. The university thanks you for your cooperation and patience as these changes took effect to streamline and optimize its retirement plans. These changes will not only lower costs for plan participants but the new menu of investment options and the transition to a sole recordkeeper also will reduce complexity making it easier to save and invest.

What happened during the transition?

As a reminder these key activities occurred earlier this year:

A new investment menu was introduced.

New TIAA accounts were issued.

Beneficiaries were all set to the plan default the first week of June. Each plan participant should update beneficiaries now for each new account that was issued if not already done.

Retirement plan savings were transferred from existing TIAA accounts to new TIAA accounts (mutual funds only; annuities remain in prior accounts).

Retirement plan savings held at prior recordkeepers American Century Fidelity Vanguard and T. Rowe Price were transferred to new TIAA accounts.

If you had investments in funds that were eliminated from the plans for your current savings and/or your future retirement plan contributions they were transferred into the Vanguard Target Date Fund based on your date of birth. You can change these investments at any time by logging into your account(s) from the JHU Benefits website.

What happens now?

Now that all your savings are with TIAA you can view your full retirement plan balance by logging into your TIAA account from the JHU Benefits website. From this one location you can:

Make investment changes to your current balance or future contributions.

Review or change your beneficiary information.

View statements for all JHU retirement plan savings.

Access retirement and financial planning tools and resources.

You may consider scheduling time to meet with the university's independent investment adviser Marsh McLennan Agency. Visit the MMA Prosper Wise website and click Talk With a Coach on the top right-hand corner. The service is free to JHU employees.

It’s challenging to maintain that optimism in moments like these when it seems just about everything is at stake and nothing is certain. You could call the American approach to retirement gambling and you wouldn’t be wrong.

Of course the future has always been uncertain. It was unknowable in 1973 during one of the highest-inflation periods; in 2000 when the dot-com bubble burst; and again in 2008 when the housing and financial markets collapsed. And it’s opaque now when the markets are down about 11.6 percent year to date while inflation remains high at 8.5 percent in July though it slowed slightly from the previous month. Bonds usually provide some cushion when stocks plummet but they haven’t provided much of a buffer either.

“This year has been unnerving for retirees because it has been a triple whammy — falling stock prices falling bond prices and high inflation” said Christine Benz director of personal finance and retirement planning at Morningstar.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNvdXRoYm1vcmUuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMTAvZm9vZC1pbmN1YmF0b3ItbWFya2V0cGxhY2UtYW5kLWZhcm0tdG8tdGFibGUtcmVzdGF1cmFudC1jb21pbmctdG8tbG9jdXN0LXBvaW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Food Incubator Marketplace and Farm-to-Table Restaurant Coming to Locust Point,"Digital Bay Center a Baltimore technology incubator and accelerator that looks to looks to assist “socially disadvantaged populations” with venture capital and investment is opening a food incubator marketplace and farm-to-table restaurant at the former home of The Port Public House and JR’s Bar & Grill at 1229 Hull St. in Locust Point. Digital Bay Center will complete the purchase of the 3760 sq. ft. building in October and is looking to open the facility in the spring.

Digital Bay Center was started by Colby Smith and Kendrick Tilghman. Peter Daniels also worked with Smith and Tilghman to develop the idea. All three said they have a passion for technology economic development and public service. Digital Bay Center’s office is at Power Plant Live! and works mainly with “technology businesses from cyber security communications technology education and workforce development to name a few” said Smith.

The company is expanding into the food industry because they see a lack of food incubators in Baltimore and love the city’s history of growing companies such as McCormick & Company; TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc. founded by Reginald F Lewis; and Park Sausages the first African American-owned company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

Daniels was born in Jamaica grew up in Jamaica Queens NY and served in the United States Marine Corps which brought him to Baltimore. He has worked at T. Rowe Price for 25 years.

Smith said he grew up in Memorial Baptist Church in East Baltimore where his grandfather was the pastor. He is also the son of a former judge for the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Smith has spent 12 years working in the court system.

Tilghman was born and raised in Baltimore and his grandfather owned the former Sphinx Club which was later run by his father. He has an MBA in electrical engineering and has a passion for “STEMifying” things especially in the food and music industry. He serves on multiple business organization in the Baltimore area.

When Daniels Smith and Tilghman discovered the Locust Point building they loved the space location and the fact that it was “pretty turn key.”

“Locust Point has been called ‘Baltimore’s Ellis Island’ where immigrants boarded large ships searching for a freedom liberty and a fresh start in the United States. So what better place to launch a new fresh journey on another kind of ship the “Entrepreneur-Ship” in Locust Point!” said Digital Bay Center in notes about the project.

The concept in Locust Point does not yet have a name but it will have a farm-to-table restaurant and stalls from small business vendors on the first floor. Digital Bay Center is removing the bar from the first floor so it’s more “family-friendly.” A smoothie shop called RX Smoothie which will offer traditional CBD and illness-based smoothies will share the second floor along with a bar. The third floor will continue to be meeting space that can be used for training meetings and neighborhood association meetings. The kitchen will be used by the restaurant and will serve as commercial kitchen space for the members businesses and students.

The building will be open to the public everyday for lunch and dinner.

The space will be “technology-driven” with kiosk ordering systems built into tables which can also be used by kids to play games. There will also be robotic servers called Belle Bots and they are working with delivery robots and drones as well as kitchen robots.

Digital Bay Center will work with smaller food-oriented mom-and-pop shops looking to get off the ground companies looking to grow regionally and businesses striving for an IPO. They will work with entrepreneurs in different aspects of the food industry to produce items that will end up on store shelves develop carryout shops and future restaurants and develop food technology.

Digital Bay Center will host community events including a Chef 4 A Day program train people on food technology train community members on the ServSafe and the Clean Kitchen Project and implement the Nourishment Innovation Network (NIN) that “will comprise community organizations local governments educational institutions and business partners who meet regularly to advance a typical food and economic opportunity agenda.”

A portion of the proceeds from Digital Bay Center will be donated to local organizations such as Francis Scott Key Elementary/Middle School Latrobe Park Pathways to Autism Cars for Cancer Children of Fallen Police Officers Foundation Wounded Warrior Project and the Locust Point Community Association.

Digital Bay Center’s Locust Point facility is funded by private investors as well as a Maryland Legislature Bond Bill that was sponsored by Senate President and District 46 Senator Bill Ferguson and District 46 Delegate and Democrat nominee for Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman. Daniels Smith and Tilghman said they also have received great guidance from District 11 Councilman Eric Costello. They thanked each of them for their support.

Digital Bay Center is hosting a public meeting tonight at 730pm at Our Lady of Good Counsel Church. It will look for community input including what the facility should be called.

Your first love a CD holder containing all of your favourite punk-rock bands from the early 2000s and even Rockstar Games’ iconic Midnight Club.

Of course the internet has afforded us the opportunity to creep on our exes and also do some digging on our nostalgic video game flings too.

With that being said after Take-Two Interactive – who just so happens to own Rockstar Games – recently dropped its Q1 2023 earnings report and listed the street racing game as one of their “franchises with individual titles that have sold-in over five million units” we can’t help but speculate about the eventual return of the one we hold dearly in our heart.

Now I’m sure you’re thinking – well that’s just a list of their most successful games duh!

Yes there’s some truth to that statement. However Midnight Club is mentioned amongst other franchise giants such as Grand Theft Auto 5 Red Dead Redemption Max Payne and L.A. Noire as a key pillar in the company’s “diverse portfolio of industry-leading owned intellectual property.”

Interestingly all of these franchises are still ‘active’ with online modes DLC or a VR version recently released and in the case of Max Payne a remake on the way. There are plenty of prior Rockstar Games titles not listed here such as Manhunt or Bully.

Could this mean the series of open-world arcade driving games might be getting a much-needed revival?

We’ve documented the history of the Midnight Club in the past with the last of its kind being released in 2008. And while there hasn’t been an official statement from Rockstar Games or T2 for that matter the breadcrumbs seem to be leading us to a magical theatre where a new rendition of Midnight Club is waiting for us with open arms and plenty of popcorn too.

This is the sixth time consecutively that the street racing goliath has appeared in an investor presentation the first being in May 2021’s Q4 2021 results.

Maybe we’re stretching at this point; maybe we’re just wishful thinking. Or maybe we’re a bit crazy and need to put the internet away for today. Whichever the case may be it’s safe to say we miss Midnight Club wholeheartedly.

After nearly 15 years without a new release from the series we’re doing our best Lizzo impression when we say “It’s about damn time” Rockstar Games brings back a little piece of our past that we just can’t seem to let go of.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZnJvbnRvZmZpY2VzcG9ydHMuY29tL25iYS0yay1vd25lci1wb3N0cy0xLTFiLXF1YXJ0ZXItbWlzc2VzLWVzdGltYXRlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'NBA 2K' Owner Posts $1.1B Quarter Misses Estimates,"Take-Two Interactive reported mixed results in its latest earnings report adding to a growing list of video game companies with underwhelming profits this year.

The New York-based company — which owns major video game publishers including Rockstar Games and 2K — generated $1.1 billion in revenue in fiscal Q1 a 36% increase year-over-year.

Projected adjusted earnings per share range between $4.60 to $4.85 in FY2023.

Wall Street estimates expected an average of $5.37 per share per Bloomberg.

The company has also seen its stock fall roughly 29% in 2022.

Take-Two will look to garner stronger results for the rest of FY2023 following the acquisition of mobile game developer Zynga for $12.7 billion in May.

The deal has already paid dividends for Take-Two which reported $1 billion in net bookings in fiscal Q1 2023 up 40% compared to the same period the year prior. The company also saw recurrent consumer spending — 75% of net bookings — grow 48% during the quarter.

As a result Take-Two raised its full-year net bookings outlook projecting a range between $5.8 billion and $5.9 billion surpassing estimates of $5.42 billion.

Big Deal

Take-Two’s deal for Zynga allows the company to expand its reach in a mobile gaming market expected to reach $338 billion by 2030. Last year the market was worth roughly $119 billion.

The acquisition — first announced in January 2022 — was funded with $2.7 billion in financing from JPMorgan Chase Take-Two’s balance sheet and a debt issuance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiI2h0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL3d3ZS0yazIzLW5ld3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Take-Two Officially Announces WWE 2K23,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiI2h0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL3d3ZS0yazIzLW5ld3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVzaHViLmNvbS9uZXdzL25ld3Mvd3dlLTJrMjMtMmstZ2FtZXMtY29uZmlybWVkLXJlbGVhc2UtZGF0ZS0yNjU2Mi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WWE 2K23 confirmed to be in development at 2K Games,"In a recent earnings call Take-Two Interactive parent company of 2K Games confirmed that WWE 2K23 is happening and that it will be published by 2K Games as originally planned. Ahead of the launch of WWE 2K22 much discussion focussed on the future of the franchise with many speculating that a failure would result in WWE passing its game development contract onto another company.

Defying all expectations WWE 2K22 was a major triumph. It debuted with a renewed sense of vigour made clever changes to the franchise’s much-hated tutorial system and included an array of great modes – including a heartfelt tribute to WWE legend Rey Mysterio. The memories of the bug-riddled WWE 2K20 were effectively erased by the latest entry and the game appears to have also cemented the good work of 2K Games and developer Visual Concepts in the eyes of WWE.

While not dwelt upon by Take-Two WWE 2K23 was notably confirmed in its recent earnings call and appeared in its list of upcoming games. No firm date was set but ‘Fiscal 2023’ was identified as the general release period. That likely puts the game in the first half of 2023 – as with WWE 2K22 before it.

Read: WWE 2K22 review – A phoenix rises from the ashes

In Take-Two’s financial report the launch of WWE 2K22 was noted as being ‘highly successful’ with the post-launch DLC game packs noted for their ability to ‘further engage’ the WWE 2K playerbase. It’s likely the next game in the series will follow this example and adapt many of the changes that WWE 2K22 made to the classic formula.

That said it shouldn’t take everything from WWE 2K22.

One of the major issues with this game was its odd roster. Because of the game’s longer development cycle it contained more than 30 wrestlers who were no longer under contract with WWE. Many of the wrestlers included were actually wrestling with rival companies like AEW by the time the game launched making for an awkward experience. Updates to the game’s roster ahead of launch are essential – as is the inclusion of newer stars like Cody Rhodes Karrion Kross Dakota Kai and Iyo Sky.

Showcase Mode also needs some tweaks if it’s going to be the ‘flagship’ game mode of WWE 2K23. The last game spotlighted Rey Mysterio in a big way but had major gaps in his career due to likeness rights not being available. It’s a tough ask but this should be resolved for whoever gets the next spotlight – Charlotte Flair perhaps? Maybe Randy Orton? AJ Styles?

Whatever 2K Games and Visual Concepts decide it’s likely WWE 2K23 will build on the surprise success of WWE 2K22 for a bigger and grander game.

A new charity launched in Dallas-Fort Worth this year hoping to help the more than 20000 children who are hearing-impaired or with multiple disabilities in North Texas.

Be An Angel is a 501(c)(3) non-profit founded in Houston more than 30 years ago. It has built a legacy of improving the quality of life for disabled and medically fragile children and their families by providing wheelchairs hearing aids respite care and other adaptive equipment and services.

Marti Boone executive director of the organization says they saw a critical need for their services and support in the DFW area and that is why Be An Angel is launching a chapter in North Texas.

“The Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex is the fourth-largest metropolitan area in the nation and home to many children with disabilities needing services support and equipment to improve their day-to-day lives” Boone says. “In fact we’ve identified more than 20000 families in Dallas-Fort Worth alone who may be in need of our services. To be able to bring a hearing aid wheelchair playground mobility device or other personal adaptive equipment to these precious children is our mission and we’re so excited to be doing so in DFW.”

For the past 12 holiday seasons Be An Angel has been gifting toys and supplies to over 200 children at the Jo Kelly School in Fort Worth and in Dallas ISD’s special education programs. However according to Denise Coffman Director of Development for Be An Angel - DFW the charity realized there was so much more they could offer in North Texas.

“Be An Angel has been such a gift for many years in the Houston area serving these special children and their families” Coffman says. “Our goal is to build on that foundation and replicate their programs and services in DFW and beyond.”

Joining Coffman in the growth of Be An Angel in North Texas are the founding partners of the DFW Chapter. The partners include David Hardin a retired investments manager long-time supporter of Be An Angel and sponsor of the playground project at the Jo Kelly School; Bruce Leonard Vice President NGL Marketing & Transportation for Targa Resources; Jennifer Green-Moneta CEO of LiveEcho Marketing; Daniel Solcher Managing Director with a business development firm; and Robert Hill Managing Member at Hill Law Firm PLLC.

In addition to the annual Christmas Gift Program a major undertaking for the charity is building barrier-free playgrounds that give special needs children and those with multiple handicaps the ability to play and enjoy a playground that is designed for them and their unique needs.

× Expand Jo Kelly School The charity has installed 36 of these playgrounds in Houston and DFW.

The charity has installed 36 of these playgrounds in Houston and DFW including the one at the Jo Kelly School in Fort Worth. More playgrounds are in the plans at other locations across North Texas and a new wheelchair-adaptive We-Go-Swing is planned for installation at Jo Kelly this fall.

Other Be An Angel programs include providing personal equipment such as wheelchairs and hearing aids to those who are profoundly deaf and offering state-licensed respite care so parents and caregivers can run errands make appointments or attend other activities. The charity’s ultimate goal is to help provide and maintain a good quality of life for children with disabilities and their families.

If you want to be involved learn about volunteer opportunities events or contribute Be An Angel is holding a Purses and Prosecco night on October 20 at the Women’s Club of Fort Worth. To learn more about the charity donate or volunteer visit their website.",,,,,,,,,,,,

See Walmart and Target place false and misleading advertisements on price displays and shelf signs a pair of new class action lawsuits allege.

Plaintiff Yoram Kahn claims in separate class action lawsuits that Walmart and Target use what is known as shelf pricing that “frequently misrepresents the prices consumers are charged at the point of sale.”

Kahn argues Walmart and Target’s alleged price misrepresentations cause consumers to “fall victim to a classic ‘bait and switch’” and “unknowingly overpay” Walmart and Target “a higher price for the falsely-advertised merchandise at checkout.”

“Consumers reasonably rely on Shelf Pricing to make informed purchasing decisions and reasonably expect to pay the advertised Shelf Price when they reach the checkout” states the Walmart class action and Target class action.

Kahn wants to represent a nationwide Class and Illinois subclass of consumers who have purchased merchandise from Walmart and/or Target and who paid a higher price than what was the advertised shelf price.

Merchandise affected by allegedly false and misleading shelf price advertising end up costing consumers around 5-10% more at Walmart and around 5-20% more at Target the Walmart class action and Target class action allege.

Walmart and Target are aware they are ‘deceiving’ consumers

Kahn argues that consumers can also be overcharged “much higher” and that Walmart and Target are both aware that they are “deceiving its consumers.”

Further Khan claims that while Target and Walmart have been fined for their alleged practice of misrepresenting shelf prices the punishment does not dissuade them since the amount of profit they make each year from the practice exceeds the amount they pay in fines.

Walmart and Target thus simply “pays the fines but continues its misleading unfair and deceptive pricing practices” according to the Walmart class action and Target class action.

Kahn claims Walmart and Target are guilty of unjust enrichment and in violation of the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Practices Act and the Illinois Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act among other things.

Plaintiff is demanding a jury trial and requesting declaratory and injunctive relief along with an award of actual compensatory and punitive damages for himself and all Class Members.

A separate class action lawsuit was filed against Target earlier this month by a consumer claiming it falsely markets its hydrogen peroxide solution as being an effective treatment for minor cuts.

Drafting an effective grassroots strategy can seem daunting at first but it is vital to ensure the long-term stability impact and success of your campaign. If you’re considering starting an advocacy campaign you likely already have an issue at hand.

The next step is to identify your objectives. What do you want to accomplish through this campaign? How will you measure this achievement? These questions will help guide you through the process of creating a successful advocacy campaign.

1. Start with a goal

Once you have determined the public policy issue that you would like to impact it’s onto the planning stage. In this first step you will identify your overarching cause and break it down into more manageable parts. For instance if your organization is advocating for environmental causes it’s best to narrow your focus and resource allocation to smaller more achievable goals like solar funding or tax breaks for renewable energy companies. That way your campaign doesn’t spread itself too thin by trying to solve multiple large-scale issues at once.

2. Craft your message

After outlining your campaign goal the next step is to craft your message. Strong communication and a compelling narrative can go a long way in influencing and inspiring the public for your cause; but as a company you must also consider your organization’s overall mission and its stakeholders.

To lead a successful advocacy campaign your message must align with not only your target audience but your company’s goals and values as well. It’s also critical to draft multiple versions to distribute through various platforms and formats. Remember that email outreach is only one channel to use – other effective options include phone calls SMS peer-to-peer messaging social media and organic search. You want to be able to reach your target audience at the right place and with a perfectly tailored message.

3. Identify your tech needs

Digital marketing has become an essential aspect of modern grassroots advocacy campaigns but posting your message online without the necessary strategy or tools simply won’t garner an audience. Grassroots professionals must have the technological resources to engage with their advocates support their campaigns and sustain their long-term goals with scalable features.

Bloomberg Government’s Megaphone is an all-in-one software solution that provides sophisticated yet intuitive tools to drive your digital advocacy campaign. Communicate with constituents track engagement and mobilize your advocacy groups to take action. You also get valuable insights on things like voter propensity civic health and election engagement.

4. Target the right audiences

Even the most persuasive message will fall on deaf ears if you don’t find the right people. Many grassroots professionals use software tools like Megaphone to identify their target audience whether they are looking to reach internal stakeholders or employees consumers or community groups. With Megaphone you get access to rich constituent profiles containing detailed information on demographics civic engagement opinion data company interactions and much more.

You can also run advanced searches and segment your audience based on specific attributes or interactions. Narrowing in on your true supporters can save your organization a lot of time and money while also advancing the movement further.

5. Track and optimize your impact

As your advocacy campaign starts to gain supporters it’s vital to track their engagement and interactions. Advocacy software like Megaphone provide you with comprehensive visibility into your constituents allowing you to analyze the data and adjust your strategy accordingly. Tracking codes enable you to build detailed profiles on your supporters with data on any number of custom attributes. Monitoring constituent engagement and campaign performance are critical to ensuring your movement reaches its internal benchmarks.

6. Gain supporters

Before the final step of activating your advocates you must first ensure that your campaign has enough traction. Gaining likes on social media is good but it won’t help if your supporters aren’t willing to take action. One way to avoid “slacktivism” is to create a volunteer group. With a strong message and a call to action you can organize your advocates into a targeted effort. That way you can grow your base of activists exponentially as your message travels by word of mouth.

A grassroots advocacy tool like Megaphone can help you develop and track data-driven strategies around communication and advocate engagement. With detailed insights into your constituent preferences it’s easy to learn and adapt as you optimize your message and audience.

7. Activate your advocates

Finally it’s time to activate your base of supporters. There are a variety of ways to go about this but modern constituents tend to prefer digital efforts such as text email and social media. The key is to deliver a well-crafted message to the right audience at the right time and in the right way.

With the right technology you can pinpoint your target audience and send messages directly to supporters. Depending on the goals of your business you can direct your supporters to vote in an upcoming election or contact state and federal legislators through a variety of channels.

8. Report back to stakeholders

Once your advocacy campaign is completed you’ll need to gather and analyze the data you collected and present this information to your stakeholders. Detailed tracking and real-time data management capabilities from Megaphone provide a comprehensive view of your constituent engagement. Create custom visual representations such as infographics and charts to demonstrate the success of your campaign to your stakeholders.

Christine McCarthy Disney’s chief financial officer disclosed the new guidance Wednesday during the company’s fiscal third quarter earnings conference call with Wall Street analysts. McCarthy also revealed that Disney will now offer subscriber updates and target predictions for Disney+ Hotstar that are separated out from Disney+ in part because Disney+ Hotstar is a different service that includes sports rights and other content not found on Disney+ in other territories.

With the warning about a slowdown in India Disney adjusted its global subscriber target for Disney+ in total to an implied a downward revision to 215 million to 245 million global subscribers by the end of its fiscal year 2024 or the end of September 2024. That’s down from 230 million to 260 million previously stated and affirmed by Disney management just last quarter.

As of the quarter that ended July 2 the total Disney+ tally including Disney+ Hotstar stood at 152.1 million subscribers while Disney+ Hotstar alone has 58.4 million subscribers. On Wednesday Disney disclosed its target for Disney+ Hotstar service by the end of fiscal 2024 was revised downward to “up to 80 million subscribers” which doesn’t leave a lot of room growth in one of the world’s most populous markets. However McCarthy suggested that Disney was being conservative and would reassess its India prospects after the dust has settled on the latest round of sports rights deals.

“We intend to refine this target over time” McCarthy said.

Disney also stated that the target for core Disney+ subscribers (not including Disney+ Hotstar) remains in the ballpark of previous forecasts of 135 million to 165 million by the close of fiscal 2024. And Disney also reaffirmed its timeline for Disney+ to achieve profitability by fiscal 2024. McCarthy also reminded analysts that Disney’s fiscal 2022 is to be the year of peak losses for Disney+. Programming and production costs for Disney+ for the quarter were $1.9 billion up 11% from the year-ago frame.

Disney’s total cash outlay on content costs for fiscal 2022 will come in slightly lower than previously forecast at around $30 billion in part because of timing changes for anticipated costs McCarthy said. Over the next few years Disney’s total content spend bill should hover in “the low 30s.”

With growth slowing significantly in the U.S. the company is sure to face new scrutiny as it crunches the numbers on long-term forecasts and the returns on all the pricey premium content produced for Disney+ and Hulu. Disney reported Wednesday that its streaming platforms combined — Disney+ ESPN+ which has 22.8 million subs and Hulu (46.2 million) — now have a total of 221 million global subscribers. That’s in the same ballpark of Netflix’s tally as of Q2 2022 (220.7 million) which means Disney CEO Bob Chapek will be pressed on where.

McCarthy emphasized the discipline that Disney demonstrated in not upping its bid to renew streaming rights to IPL matches that have been a cornerstone of Hotstar. In June Disney was outbid for the sought-after streaming rights by rival Indian streaming group Viacom18 although it retained linear rights for the Hotstar platform.

The Disney+ Hotstar streamer debuted in April 2020 on the heels of the Disney+ launch in the U.S. in November 2019. The existing Hotstar service came into the Disney family through its 2019 acquisition of 21st Century Fox."

When electrical connections and components break down unexpectedly the result may be unplanned downtime costly repairs and production loss. There’s also an increased risk of fire due to electrical short-circuits or cable burning. That’s why it’s important to perform routine checks to ensure that the electrical distribution system is in proper working order including inspection of busbars circuit breakers fuses and switchboards. Electrical distribution boards are typically housed inside cabinet enclosures making them difficult to inspect for impending failures.

A Solution

Electrical connections and components typically show signs of overheating before they fail. Thermal imaging technology can provide key information that the eyes alone cannot detect. A thermal camera such as the FLIR E95 can show maintenance professionals hot spots on components and connections helping them recognize stressed elements of an electrical installation before failure and break down. This gives them the opportunity to solve electrical issues as part of planned maintenance before it causes a serious and costly problem. Maintenance professionals can also use thermal imaging in combination with other instruments including clamp meters digital multimeters and IR Windows to ensure the distribution system is operating optimally.

The Results

Through regular thermal inspections maintenance professionals can quickly detect and locate temperature issues (hot spots) on electrical components and equipment. Loose connections bad contact fuse issues unbalanced loads and stressed earth leakage can be discovered using a thermal imager. Improve safety by reducing risk of electrical fire; avoid unexpected breakdowns; reduce risk of unplanned electrical outages; and organize planned repairs and preventive maintenance.

In this interview AZoSensors talks to Inder Kohli Senior Product Manager at Teledyne DALSA about 3D laser triangulation how it can help the vision technology industry and everything else about 3D imaging

What is 3D Laser Triangulation?

As the name suggests this technique uses a trigonometric calculation to compute the height of an object from an image of a laser line (or a laser spot) projected onto an object.

Can you explain how 3D vision technology has changed over the past two decades?

Like various other technologies 3D laser profilers have also benefitted from the increasing density at higher speeds reduced footprint and increased level of microchip integration. Higher speed bigger FPGAs with dedicated microprocessors and low power small footprint lasers have made 3D laser profilers more accessible for several inline inspection applications.

Why did 1D (line scan) and 2D (area-imaging) dominate the industry 15 years ago?

Both 1D and 2D imaging sensors continue to thrive because these are one of the core building blocks of 3D laser sensors. For example high frame rate image sensors with integrated image enhancement features allow 3D laser profilers to deliver higher resolution and higher reliability.

What gives 3D tech the edge over these platforms?

Parallel advancements in image sensor quality and speed embedded vision FPGAs lasers optics and smart systems have made 3D imaging a much more viable option today. 3D imaging technologies are now low-cost reliable repeatable easy to implement and proven in a wide variety of demanding applications. While 1D and 2D are still in wide use 3D can now add invaluable information to the decision matrix in nearly every instance.

For better results applications often combine 1D 2D and 3D cameras and sensors to get more information about the object on which to base the decisions. Better decisions can drive efficiency reduce wastage and increase profitability.

What 3D Laser Triangulation platforms does Teledyne offer? How do these compare with similar devices available to consumers?

Image credit: Teledyne DALSA

The Z-Trak2™ family of 3D Laser Profilers features Teledyne’s 3D image sensor technology. The Z-Trak2 S2K0 series with its 45000 Hz profile and 5GigE Vision interface targets high-speed in-line 3D measurement applications while the Z-Trak2 V2K0 series with a 10000 Hz profile rate and 1GigE interface is designed for cost-sensitive inline measurement applications.

In addition the Z-Trak2 family features hardware-based real-time profile acquisition and processing functions that simplify system design while minimizing processing overheads. With its single scan HDR Z-Trak2 scans surfaces of varying degrees of reflectivity it avoids the complexity of image alignment and image stitching required when using multiple scans with different exposure times to capture the surface details.

Single cable multi-sensor synchronization and its ability to create a common measurement space by combining multiple Z-Traks of different types ensure robust reliable and repeatable results.

Can you explain how 3D Laser Triangulation builds an image?

A typical 3D laser profiler uses a trigonometric relationship between a laser line and a 2D image sensor to perform the measurements. A 3D laser profiler contains a laser at a known distance from the image sensor; the image sensor is tilted at a known angle with respect to the laser.

The distance angle and position of the laser line as imaged on the sensor are used to calculate the height (Z) and width of the object along the laser line (X). A known displacement between two consecutive profiles provides the length along the motion (Y).

How has this technology been kept low-cost?

Integrated laser triangulation profilers are easier to use and set up and require no special operator training to get the results. For example all Z-Trak2 models are factory calibrated to output height and width in world measurement units.

In addition all Z-Trak2 models use standard off-the-shelf cables and network components to build cost-effective 3D measurement systems. To further keep the total ownership cost low Teledyne DALSA also offers a free Sherlock 8 software license (a field-proven point-and-click machine vision software package for factory floor applications) when using Z-Trak1 or Z-Trak2.

Can you explain how advancements in high-speed CMOS sensors combined with FPGA and powerful embedded systems have boosted this technology?

High performance CMOS image sensors deliver a high frame rate and on-chip features like HDR binning and multiple AOIs. A high frame rate/profile rate allows 3D profilers to scan fast-moving objects with higher resolution without slowing down the production line. When combined with FPGA the profilers can off-load processors from various pre-processing steps while delivering results deterministically.

What range of resolutions can 3D Laser Triangulation operate at without sacrificing accuracy?

A wide range of optical arrangements is possible with this technology without having to change the processing architecture. Simply changing the mechanical and optical design to obtain diverse resolutions can scale from several meters down to 5 microns.

Why are users now increasingly turning to this technology?

Decreasing costs increasing speed ease of deployment and maintenance are enabling a wider acceptance of 3D profilers. Almost all machine vision applications can use inline height width and length measurements to improve product quality and reduce waste.

What makes this technology easy to integrate and why is this advantageous?

Integrated laser triangulation profilers like Z-Trak2 include a laser a 2D image sensor lens and filters and these are all factory calibrated. They target ease-of-use and low maintenance as they require no special operator training or any in-field re-calibration.

In addition some profile sensors like Z-Trak2 use standard off-the-shelf cables and network components to build cost-effective 3D measurement systems. Interoperable with 3rd party or proprietary software packages make the integration flexible and preserves the investment in the software tools. To help reduce the cost of ownership further Teledyne DALSA offers a free Sherlock 8 software license.

How can AI be used to boost this technology?

Developments in modern electronics and artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled systems to become even more powerful and at a reasonable cost. For example our Z-Trak family of profilers output profiles and also the intensity data at the same time. By combining this data AI models can classify different defects.

What are some of the drawbacks to 3D Laser Triangulation? How is Teledyne working to combat these?

The triangulation setup used in the profilers creates occlusion because the laser and the image sensor are always at an angle with each other. Teledyne DALSA offers the ability to combine multiple Z-Trak profilers to scan an object from different angles to eliminate occlusion. Laser speckle is also a challenge which is the inherent noise generated by the laser itself reducing the resolution of systems.

Or follow us on Google News

My wife and I are still just as thrilled with our Tesla Model 3 in almost three years of driving since we took delivery on October 22 2019. My odometer just hit 75000 miles. The ultra-smooth quiet rocket-like acceleration as well as multiple software updates culminating in Full Self Driving (Beta) have kept us excited for the entire two years and 9 months. We have driven coast to coast from North Carolina to California and have made multiple round trips from Utah to Wisconsin. In all that driving we never found a Supercharger full or out of order. You just plug in and Tesla bills your credit card automatically. We are able to drive the same 500 miles per day that we did with our gas cars.

Maintenance Costs

My full warranty ran out at 50000 miles.

My battery and drive system warranty will run out in another 25000 miles at 100000 miles.

I’ve ignored the incessant advertising from Car Shield to buy an extended warranty. I’m going naked because I’m counting on the simplicity of electric drive compared to the complexity of a gasoline motor system and transmission to keep maintenance costs to a minimum. I have also taken care by limiting the state of charge of my battery to between 20% and 80% as much as possible to keep my battery healthy. I charge to 90% about an hour before long trips but I have never charged to 100%.

I had to replace one squeaky front suspension joint which was covered by the warranty. My routine maintenance costs have been for tires and wheel alignment. At this time my alignment is perfect as Tesla measured 5 mm everywhere on all four tires. They recommended against tire rotation. I’m on my third set of tires because of the heavy weight of the car and perhaps my acceleration demos to friends and family. I have spent $1143.37 on tires and a total of $480 for wheel alignment twice. I still have 5 mm tread after 25000 miles on my “no-name” $565.44 Kenda Vezda tires. You would need to spend well over $1000 for the equivalent of the original equipment Michelin tires. My el cheapo tires have lasted significantly longer than the original equipment tires and when new performed just as well. As the tires have worn down the road noise has gone up. It is significantly annoying at this point. This would be true of any tires and I’m not sure that the one inch of foam glued into the original equipment tires makes much difference.

I recently had my first non-warranty repair. I had noticed a loss of power warning and a hard speed limit of 60 mph a couple of times over the last year. I told the service department in Minneapolis about it when I took my car in for glass replacement a few weeks ago. They asked me for the exact time of the incident and proposed the replacement of the rear Superbottle for $503.50. I understand it regulates the temperature of the motor and the battery. I believe on newer Model 3s it has been replaced by the Octovalve.

I do 95% of my L2 charging in my garage at 32 amps and 28 miles of charge per hour. I estimate my fueling costs are about 1/4 the price of gas for a similarly size car when others are paying $5/gal for gas.

Full Self Driving (Beta)

After 200+ days using FSD (Beta) I lost access to it when my wife and I had 5 forced disengagements and my privileges were revoked.

I downloaded FSD (Beta) on November 23 2021 and used it obsessively driving every day with versions V10.5 V10.8 V10.10 V10.11.2.1 and V10.12.2. for 206 days until it was revoked. Tesla has promised to restore my privileges with a future software release but I am not holding my breath.

I spent $6000 for FSD when I bought the car. It gives me automatic navigation automatic passing of slower vehicles on limited access highways turn signal initiated automatic lane changes as well as stopping at stoplights and stop signs. Additionally FSD (Beta) used to drive my car automatically on city streets from my starting point (in front of my driveway or the Walmart parking lot) to any location I picked or entered into my navigation. It used to drive me the 18 miles on a winding road with two hairpin turns up and down Big Cottonwood to the Brighton Ski Resort in Utah where I teach — without me having to control the steering wheel the accelerator or the brakes. Now it will still do that except that it fails to navigate the hairpin turns like it used to do with FSD Beta and it no longer navigates the sharp turns in rotaries.

If you were patient and there was no other traffic FSD (Beta) would do most low-traffic trips with no intervention. It was also particularly good navigating at stoplights and was surprisingly good handling 4-way stop signs.

It would require intervention when there was cross traffic or when a driver was behind you at rotaries and stop signs. You didn’t need to touch the steering wheel but you needed to give a little push on the accelerator to convince the system to proceed when it was being too timid/cautious.

FSD (Beta) would also give me autosteer on any single-lane road not just roads with painted lines like the regular autosteer that is on every Tesla. This was particularly useful in Northern Wisconsin where we have many unmarked roads.

When My Tesla Model 3 Can Substitute for a Full Size F-150 Pickup Truck

A third party receiver a tow bar or bike rack and a good sized trailer let my Model 3 substitute for a much bigger vehicle.

A good sized trailer can let you use your Model 3 to haul a golf cart as shown above tow a 3000 lb ski boat (see below) or haul 8×12 ft professional size wallboard. Having 363 hp from the dual-motor drive allows you to pull a heavy boat out of the water so easily you don’t even feel it.

With a good tray type bike rack installed in your receiver you can haul two good sized mountain e-bikes. Unfortunately the much increased aerodynamic drag from the bikes greatly reduces range but my dual-motor Model 3 has 310 miles nominal range so I can still travel conveniently cross-country since Tesla Superchargers are usually spaced every 100 miles or less.

“That’s the reason the guy flew by me as I was coming here” traffic officer Al Gonzalez said. The guy he snagged was going 63 in a 40 mph zone on the misnamed Mukilteo Speedway.

I met up with Gonzalez at Lighthouse Park. It was a media stop thankfully not a traffic stop. This squad car has plenty more of those in its future.

“Police” is in subdued lettering on the sides. The top is slick. The lightbars are inside and inconspicuous.

“People have their guard down because they don’t see me” Gonzalez said. “People on the phone following too close even like today the speeder blowing by.”

Gonzalez is the man in the Tesla. The city’s other traffic officer rides a motorcycle.

The traffic Tesla hit the streets of Mukilteo near the end of July.

“I usually get a double-take when people see it” Gonzalez said. “I had one gentleman he was afraid to stop. He said he was a little apprehensive. He didn’t know police had Teslas. He was shocked.”

A few violators have told him “Nice ride.”

The car draws its critics.

“They’ll be like ‘Oh I didn’t know Mukilteo had the budget for a Tesla’” he said.

Actually it’s the police department’s fourth Tesla as part of its “green fleet” initiative. Three other Teslas two Model Ys and a Model 3 are for detectives unmarked and of undisclosed colors.

This is the first Tesla pulling traffic duty. Total cost with the cage lights and other crime-fighting gizmos was about $75000.

“That’s about the same cost that we have budgeted for the patrol SUVs to get them all outfitted” Police Chief Cheol Kang said.

It is the same Tesla model in a pilot patrol test by the Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office in 2021. The car has been reassigned as an investigations vehicle.

“There are currently not enough rapid charging stations throughout the county for this vehicle to be used on patrol” sheriff spokesperson Courtney O’Keefe said in an email.

So far in the bedroom community of Mukilteo the police charging stations provide enough juice.

Mukilteo’s new Tesla replaced a 2013 Ford Interceptor sedan (sequel to the Crown Vic) that the department donated to Sno-Isle Tech Skills Center for teen auto students.

“They got that thing fixed up cleaned up and functional” Kang said. “They were able to give it a little bit of life back.”

The Tesla came with a mind of its own.

“The Tesla is basically a giant computer that they built a car around” Kang said.

Teslas are equipped with basic autopilot.

“Our staff have been directed that we will NOT use that function” he said.

According to data.wa.gov there are about 5000 Tesla models registered in Snohomish County.

“A few years ago it might have stood out but there are so many on the road now” Kang said. “Hopefully word spreads and it gets people to change their behavior when driving. It’s an amazing force multiplier because it makes you think twice whenever you see a Tesla coming towards you.”

The Tesla is scoring high marks for performance. Unlike its gassy cousins there’s no idling. The tireless workhorse pulls a 10-hour shift with juice to spare and gets charged overnight.

Talk about instant torque.

“It goes 0-to-60 miles an hour in 3½ to 4 seconds” Gonzalez said. “It handles really well around curves.”

The Tesla stops traffic when it isn’t doing the stopping.

The car was a whale of an attraction parked at Lighthouse Park.

“Can I take a picture?” asked Bob Wang a visitor from New York. He wanted to show his police friend back home.

Mukilteo resident Phil Salditt contemplated committing a crime.

“What can I do to get arrested? I’ve always wanted to ride in a Tesla” he said.

Tesla drivers are testing whether the Full Self-Driving software stops for children with varying results.

One video that did not use FSD went viral after it showed a Tesla plowing over a child-sized mannequin.

The tests are not subject to US testing standards and Elon Musk called one of the videos a ""scam.""

Tesla drivers are staging their own tests to determine if the carmaker's Full Self-Driving (FSD) software stops for children.

On Tuesday a video from Tesla critic Taylor Ogan went viral after it showed a side-by-side comparison of a Tesla next to a Lexus that appears to be equipped with Luminar autonomous driving sensors. In the clip the Tesla plows over a child-sized mannequin while the Lexus slows to a halt mere feet from another mannequin.

The video — which was taken in May in San Mateo California and now has over 12 million views on Twitter —has since spurred multiple users to test how Tesla's FSD interacts with children.

However Ogan told Insider the original video shows a failure of Tesla's Automatic Emergency Braking system (AEB) and FSD was not in use. Tesla's AEB is designed to work at speeds between 3 to 90 miles per hour though the company has added the disclaimer that it is ""designed to reduce the severity of an impact"" and not to ""avoid a collision.""

""Of course it's not going to stop for a child consistently on an advanced software if it's not stopping on AEB"" Ogan said.

Independent tests yield varying results

Ogan has been known to repost videos of Tesla FSD gaffs. His recent viral video was posted after tech CEO Dan O'Dowd shared a similar video of a Tesla that was allegedly using FSD driving through a toddler-sized mannequin at about 25 miles per hour.

A spokesperson for O'Dowd said the CEO has been in touch with Ogan but their videos were performed and posted independently.

O'Dowd's video spurred debates on Twitter as to whether FSD was truly activated during the test and several users attempted to recreate the test with varying results.

The tests conducted by O'Dowd Ogan and other Twitter users were all done independently without the oversight of a US regulator which means they are not subject to testing standards.

The raw materials needed to produce an EV battery have increased by an average of 140% since March 2020 according to data by Alix Partners. picture alliance / Contributor

A Tesla spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment from Insider but Tesla CEO Elon Musk called O'Dowd's video a ""scam"" in a comment on Twitter.







Tesla has told drivers that the system does not replace a licensed driver and instructs them to keep their hands on the wheel and be prepared to take over when the system is running.

Though FSD claims to be fully self-driving in reality it operates as an optional add-on that enables Teslas to automatically change lanes enter and exit highways recognize stop signs and traffic lights and park. The software is still in a beta testing mode and requires a licensed driver to monitor it at all times.

FSD currently has over 100000 subscribers who Tesla can use to test the software in real time and allow the system's AI to learn from experienced drivers.

Still some drivers remain skeptical of the technology. One Twitter user posted a video that appeared to show Tesla's FSD identifying a cardboard cut-out of a child and slowing multiple times for it as a stationary object in the street as well as an object in motion.

A YouTuber also tried his own test with a balloon imitation of a child. In the video the Tesla slams into the dummy as it moves across the road.

""Generally speaking I am very pro-Tesla and I really don't want to expose a situation like this but I have to state the facts"" the YouTuber known as TechGeek Tesla said. ""Tesla has some work to do here.""

The driver said he felt his figure was representative of an actual child though he noted the dummy did not move like a real person.

Tesla fan blog @WholeMarsBlog reposted a series of videos that appeared to show Tesla FSD stopping for pedestrians.

""I drive with FSD Beta with my kids in the car all the time"" Twitter user @TeslaDriver2022 told EV blog Teslarati. ""I see how safe it is. It's safer than anything else that's out there."""

But a shortage of semiconductor chips used in the pumps has hampered Baxter's production and the problem continues to overshadow its manufacturing.

It's a pressing matter for the Orleans County plant and its 271 employees. Earlier this summer the company put some of its workers on paid furlough for a few weeks due to a chip shortage. The same thing could happen again in the near future said Jose Almeida Baxter's chairman president and CEO.

""Whatever we cannot supply in terms of components and we don't have enough work for the employees then we will furlough them for a period of time but we pay them"" Almeida said at the plant on Thursday.

Baxter is capable of making 80000 to 100000 pumps a year at the Medina site but that depends on receiving the components required to make them Almeida said. Each pump system contains about 70 chips.

""The crisis is so acute that sometimes we don't have visibility two or three months down the road to what actually is happening with inventory"" he said.

That creates a tough situation both for the workers and for the hospitals that need the pumps Almeida said.

Almeida was joined at the Medina plant by Sen. Charles Schumer who called for a key supplier Texas Instruments to provide more chips to the facility. Schumer said he sent a letter to Texas Instruments' CEO Rich Templeton – an upstate New York native – and plans to follow up with a call in the next day or two to make his case.

""I am telling Mr. Templeton there's a desperate shortage"" Schumer said. ""And this isn't just like chips that would go into a dishwasher or something like that. These are chips needed to save people's lives.""

Schumer said the chip shortage highlights the need for legislation he championed that was recently signed into law by President Biden. The CHIPs and Science bill creates incentives for semiconductor manufacturers to build plants in the United States. Gov. Kathy Hochul on Thursday signed state legislation also aimed at promoting semiconductor investment and job creation.

In the short term Almeida said more chips are essential to Baxter's Medina operations.

""This is extremely vital for the company and I'm very confident [Senate Majority Leader] Schumer will get us what we need and we will continue to provide the healthcare system in this country what they need"" he said.

Almeida is familiar with the region: he lived in Clarence for a short time when he was chief operating officer of Greatbatch Technologies. He heaped praise on the workers at Baxter's Medina plant for their response at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic working multiple shifts to produce pumps that hospitals needed immediately.

""This plant had the most heroic workforce in Western New York and I feel so proud"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8va2lzc2VscGFzby5jb20vYnVjLWVlcy13aGF0YWJ1cmdlci1hbmQtb3RoZXItaWNvbmljLWNvbXBhbmllcy1zdGFydGVkLXVwLWluLXRleGFzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Buc-ee's Whataburger and These 9 Companies Started Up in Texas,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='kisselpaso.com', port=443): Read timed out.

In a journalism fellowship to China India and the United States years before today’s fraught geopolitics I was told by chip designers semiconductor companies and their industry associations one similar message – the days of doing everything yourself were nearly over.

In 2007 the industry was undergoing profound change. China’s opening up to be the world’s factory meant almost every new electronic device was going to be made there.

India had thousands of expert engineers who had spent time in American electronics firms like the old Texas Instruments and were eager to start out with their own chip design companies. If only they could find someone to manufacture their chips.

This was where chip foundries came in. These contract manufacturers took chip designs and manufactured them in bulk by investing in high-tech machines and processes that smaller chip design companies could not afford to.

And American technology firms saw the future clearly – they might all have to outsource the manufacture of chips overseas to Asia particularly Taiwan which had an expertise in it to be competitive.

In this post-Cold War world globalisation and outsourcing were the bywords for success. If you could find a niche in this highly optimised closely knit semiconductor supply chain you could make a lot of money making the digital foundations for anything from phones to cameras.

Things are a little different today. Sure the semiconductor industry is still making lots of money – exceeding US$600 billion in 2021 – but the fine balance it had achieved over the years is facing an uncertain future.

To the surprise of many in a “boring” sector that outsiders simplistically associate with people in bunny suits it has become the centre of attention amid great-power politics in recent years.

The latest move came from US president Joe Biden today as he signed a landmark Bill to provide US$52.7 billion in subsidies to boost the country’s semiconductor production and research.

Called a “once-in-a-generation investment in America” the effort is aimed at bringing the manufacture of components critical to its economy and military back on home soil.

As Russia found out in its costly invasion of Ukraine this year Western sanctions that limit the export of the semiconductors used to make say precision weapons have badly hurt its war effort.

China is also ramping up its own expertise in this sector after seeing Huawei being starved of the most advanced smartphone chips and losing its lead in the market.

The Chinese company’s difficulties have been well documented. A key reason is how the semiconductor sector has been set up over the past decade and a half.

In a bid to overcome inefficiencies any overlap has been thoroughly consolidated. This means there usually are very few players doing the same thing in the complex supply chain that turns silicon into chips containing millions of transistors.

One important part of this chain – fabrication plants that manufacture the chips on a mass scale – has been the focus of late.

Though there are a number of them around only two – TSMC in Taiwan and Samsung of Korea – have the know-how to make the latest generation of chips using a 3-nanometre process.

Even if you have the expertise to do so it costs US$20 billion to build such a plant. This is just one “bottleneck” in a highly optimised sector with hardly any slack.

Notably in 2001 there were 17 companies that could make the most advanced chips according to Stanford but today only TSMC and Samsung will be able to make that dream chip you have just designed.

Further down the chain you’d also find that there are very few companies that design and make the machines that make these chips.

ASML in the Netherlands has been in the news as the main go-to outfit for anyone making a machine to make computer chips. It controls 90 per cent of the market for these lithography systems.

ASML works with Imec a Belgian research outfit that produces breakthroughs in lithography which “prints” a circuit design onto a substrate using highly sensitive equipment.

Without the expertise and innovation from these places it is hard to design and produce a cutting-edge chip from the ground up. And if you have been noticing many of these outfits are from the West or West-friendly places.

This is not to mention others in the supply chain such as electronic design automation (EDA) tools from American companies like Cadence and Synopsys which make the software needed to design a complex chip.

Plus there are chip design companies such as Arm from Britain that license their designs as building blocks to build more advanced chips.

Apple’s groundbreaking M1 and M2 chips are based on Arm designs as are most of today’s smartphone chips from Qualcomm and Samsung.

This is why China which depends on semiconductors for its self-designed products as well as those that it makes for foreign manufacturers has embarked on a well publicised effort to be self sufficient.

There was news recently that the country’s semiconductor firm SMIC could make 7-nanometre chips apparently a breakthrough despite the Western restrictions.

That is still some way from the most advanced chips however and many experts you ask will say it is not that easy to vertically integrate a globally optimised supply chain.

The same problems will face the US as it seeks to secure its own supply of advanced chips by making them on home soil. Some of its chip champions such as Micron and Intel run their own fabs to make their own chips but this business is not an easy one.

AMD a long-time rival PC chipmaker to Intel will tell you this. Its founder Jerry Sanders once famously said “real men have fabs” in a retort to competitors outsourcing their manufacturing.

However it too had to cast off its fabs in 2008 after struggling to maintain them. Since then it has moved ahead of the game by outsourcing the manufacturing of its chips to third parties.

Designing more advanced chips to be made with new-generation manufacturing processes meant it could beat Intel at performance. It has also become a more valuable company than Intel.

So departing from a well optimised supply chain carries risk. As governments seek to bring their semiconductor fabs and expertise home they also might make them less competitive and more costly to run.

In a perfectly balanced semiconductor world nobody does anything that doesn’t add value – they are quickly consolidated – so the next generation of chips will keep improving at breakneck pace to enable new uses.

This fine balance is also why any small disruption will set back supply drastically. The pandemic a war in Europe and geopolitical tensions between the two largest economies have not helped.

The chip shortage is why you have not been able to buy a Playstation 5 (without paying a scalper) and why the car you just ordered doesn’t come with a head-up display.

The issue will get more acute in the years ahead as every other smart device looks to have a logic or memory chip inside from a self driving car to a military drone.

Now imagine if the semiconductor sector gets disrupted further in the short term or de-optimised over a longer period. Or worse if TSMC situated on an island that China claims and the US promises to help defend becomes a flashpoint for a larger conflict.

Today’s technology Cold War is a long way from the perfectly tuned optimally efficient conditions that many had expected the semiconductor sector to enjoy more than a decade ago. The view from the clean room has changed."

The contract in question is for the Mine Countermeasures Unmanned Surface Vehicle a critical component to the technology package the Navy is developing to detect and destroy undersea mines. Textron Systems played an integral role in the research and development of that vehicle through its Common Unmanned Surface Vehicle.

Despite the company’s background in the program Bollinger Shipyards won the production contract awarded in April and Textron subsequently protested the win through the Government Accountability Office’s bid protest process.

A bid protest is one mechanism industry can use if it believes the government awarded a contract inappropriately. They are notoriously difficult to win and the government is not legally bound to respect the watchdog’s opinions but federal agencies often will change course if GAO sustains an industry challenge.

Textron alleged the Navy “misevaluated Bollinger’s proposal” made “improper and inadequate” cost evaluations and argued the service’s decision was “unreasonable because it was based on flawed underlying evaluations” according to GAO’s decision which the watchdog published on Aug. 9.

A Textron spokeswoman had not responded to a request for comment from Breaking Defense by time of publication.

The watchdog found Textron’s arguments about the technical evaluation boiled down to a disagreement of how the Navy and the company interpreted the solicitation’s language.

“Essentially Textron has argued that Bollinger’s proposal could have been more detailed or based on more comparable experience. The agency however did not ignore this possibility as the protester suggests” GAO writes citing the Navy’s evaluation of Textron’s technical factors as “outstanding” while giving Bollinger an “acceptable” rating.

“More to the point Textron has not established that Bollinger did not meet the requirements defined by the solicitation in a manner consistent with the agency’s qualitative evaluation and adjectival rating of acceptable” the watchdog’s decision continues.

Textron also argued that the Navy’s analysis of Bollinger’s proposed labor rates was inadequate because it didn’t compare those rates to Textron’s. (GAO redacted the associated dollar amounts from its publicly available decision.)

“Textron insists that the agency was obligated to dive deeper in a comparison of the offeror’s proposals calculating and analyzing each offeror’s split between self-performed hours and subcontracted hours and reviewing each category for differences between the offerors” according to the watchdog.

GAO denied this allegation on the grounds that a government agency does not have to achieve “scientific certainty” when evaluating projected costs but rather only needs to be confident the information is reasonable within the context it is provided. In other words if Bollinger’s cost proposals made sense in the context of that company’s proposal then the Navy has no obligation to compare every dollar per hour against Textron’s proposal.

The company’s last allegation related to the selection being based on “flawed underlying assumptions” was also summarily dismissed because it largely depended on GAO agreeing with at least some of the other complaints Textron filed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvdGV4dHJvbi1zLW5ldy1raW5nLWFpci0zNjAtbWFkZS1pdHMtc2hvdy1kZWJ1dC1pbi1icmF6aWwtMTk1NzA3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Textron's New King Air 360 Made Its Show Debut in Brazil,"The main event in the aviation industry this week was the Latin American Business Aviation Conference & Exhibition (LABACE) taking place from August 9 to August 11 in Sao Paolo Brazil.

The Institutional Review Board of the University of Wisconsin-Madison Health Sciences waived ethical approval for this work. AerosolSense instruments (Thermo Fisher Scientific cat. 2900AA) were deployed in various indoor community settings for air pathogen surveillance. Samplers were placed in high-traffic areas on flat surfaces 1-1.5 meters off the ground and calibrated to sample 200 liters of air per minute. AerosolSense cartridges (Thermo Fisher Scientific cat. 12148001) were installed and removed from the air sampler according to the manufacturer brochure and transferred to the lab for testing71. We developed a workflow to simplify data collection management and reporting (Supplementary Fig. 1). The workflow relies on the iOS and Android Askidd mobile app to easily collect air cartridge metadata and upload it to a centralized LabKey database. Air sampler users simply open the Askidd app and take a picture of the air cartridge barcode when installed and removed from the machine. The Askidd app collects GPS coordinates of the air sampler timestamp AerosolSense instrument ID and air cartridge barcode to send to LabKey. When air sample testing was completed in the lab the results were uploaded to the Labkey database and displayed in the Askidd mobile app. This workflow tracks data for every cartridge and limits user errors that could occur during manual input.

Detection of SARS-CoV-2

University of Wisconsin–Madison

Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay

AerosolSense cartridges collected at a hospital in Dane County Wisconsin from August 20th to October 25th 2021 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA using the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay (Hologic) on the Panther System (Hologic). The Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay was authorized for emergency use authorization (EUA) by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the qualitative detection of vRNA72. Air cartridges were collected from AerosolSense Samplers as recommended by the manufacturer. One substrate was removed from the cartridge using sterile forceps transferred to a tube containing 750 µL of universal transport medium (Copan) and incubated at room temperature for 5–10 min. Following the incubation 500 µL of the eluate was transferred to a Panther Fusion Specimen Lysis Tube (Hologic) containing 710 µL of specimen transport medium. The tube was gently mixed by inverting it several times before loading it into the Panther System to automatically run the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay as described by the manufacturer. Aptima SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative controls were run with each set of air samples. According to the manufacturer’s recommendations an estimated cut-off value of >650 RLU was used to consider samples as SARS-CoV-2 positive.

CDC SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assay

RNA extraction and real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) testing of the air cartridge specimens occurred at the University of Wisconsin-Madison WVDL-WSLH COVID Laboratory (WWCL Madison Wisconsin). Each air cartridge was submerged in 500 µL of 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for at least 1 h. For all air cartridges the tubes were vortexed vigorously and 190 µL of the PBS was used for RNA extraction using the MagMAX Viral/Pathogen II (MVP II) Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on a 96-well KingFisher Flex extraction platform and eluted in a volume of 50 µL according to manufacturer’s instructions. A multiplex one-step RT-qPCR assay targeting the 2019-nCoV N gene sequences (N1 and N2) and the human RnaseP (RP) gene was used for the SAR-CoV-2 viral detection. The RT-qPCR primers and probes sequences were based on the CDC assay73 with alternative fluorophores on the 5’ end of each probe (along with 3’ black hole quencher) for multiplexing. The N1 probe was labeled with ABY dye the N2 probe with the FAM dye and the RP probe with the VIC dye. The 16 µL reaction mix consists of 1× TaqPath 1-Step Multiplex Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 250 nM of each forward and reverse primers for the N1 and N2 targets 100 nM of each forward and reverse primer for the RP gene target 62.5 nM for each of the N1 and N2 probes 50 nM of the RP probe and 5 µl of sample RNA or controls. The RT-qPCR amplification was performed with one cycle at 53 °C for 10 mins and 95 °C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 3 s and 60 °C for 30 s on a QuantStudio 7 Pro Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The data was analyzed in the Design and Analysis 2.6.0 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the auto baseline and threshold settings at 0.15 for N1 and N2 and 0.1 for the RP. Samples with amplification (Ct < 40) in both the N1 and N2 targets were determined as positive for SARS-CoV-2 according to the instructions for use73. In contrast samples with amplification in only one of the targets were determined as inconclusive and samples without amplification in both N1 and N2 targets were deemed negative for SARS-CoV-2. Each run included a negative extraction control using a pool of previously identified SARS-CoV-2 negative samples positive extraction control negative template control and positive amplification control plasmid. All controls had to exhibit the expected performance for the assay to be considered valid. The RP gene was utilized for the analysis of human nasal swab samples performed at the same laboratory. It was not factored in for the result criteria for the air filter samples due to the low and inconsistent level of human cellular material trapped by the air filters.

TrueMark respiratory panel

AerosolSense cartridges collected from community testing sites from October 25 2021 to February 9 2022 were tested for the presence of 40 different respiratory tract viral bacterial and fungal nucleic acids using the TrueMark Respiratory Panel 2.0 TaqMan Array Card (TAC) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Substrates were extracted from the AerosolSense cartridge using sterile forceps submerged into tubes containing 500 µL of PBS vortexed for 5 s and stored at 4 C for 10–30 min. Samples were removed from 4C and sterile forceps were used to disrupt the substrate by pressing it against the bottom of the tube several times to ensure bound particles were eluted into the PBS. According to the manufacturer’s recommendations the substrate was removed from the tube and nucleic acids were isolated from the eluate using the Maxwell Viral Total Nucleic Acid Purification Kit (Promega) with the Maxwell 16 instrument (Promega). Briefly 300 µL of the eluate was transferred to a tube containing 300 µL of lysis buffer and 30 µL of Proteinase K. A nuclease-free water control was processed with each Maxwell run and used in the TrueMark protocol as a no-template control. Tubes were vortexed for 5 s and incubated on a heat block at 56 °C for 10 min. Following incubation samples were centrifuged for 1 min to pellet any debris. Then 630 µL of each reaction mix was transferred into a Maxwell 16 cartridge loaded into a Maxwell 16 instrument and processed with the Viral Total Nucleic Acid program. Nucleic acids were eluted in 50 µL of RNase-free water. To perform the preamplification protocol 5 µL of isolated nucleic acids were transferred into a PCR strip tube containing 2.5 µL of TaqPath 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix CG (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 2.5 µL of TrueMark Respiratory Panel 2.0 PreAmp Primers (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Pre-amplification was performed on a thermocycler with the following cycling conditions: UNG incubation step at 25 °C for 2 min reverse transcription at 50 °C for 30 min UNG inactivation at 95 °C for 2 min 14 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s (denaturation) 60 °C for 2 min (annealing and extension) followed by inactivation at 99.9 °C for 10 min and 4 °C until samples were ready for use. Pre-amplified products were diluted 1:20 in nuclease-free water and the TrueMark Respiratory Panel 2.0 Amplification Control (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was diluted 1:2 to include with every set of samples. TrueMark reaction mix was prepared by combining 20 µL of each diluted preamplified product with 50 µL of TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 30 µL of nuclease-free water. TAC were equilibrated to room temperature and 100 µL of each reaction mix was loaded into its respective TAC port. TAC were centrifuged twice at 301 × g for 1 min each spin. TAC were sealed with a TAC Sealer loaded into the QuantStudio 7 Pro Real-Time PCR System (QS7) and run with the settings recommended by the manufacturer. Data were exported from the QS7 into the Thermo Fisher Design and Analysis Software 2.6.0. Data were analyzed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations using the relative quantification module with the cycle relative threshold algorithm (Crt). Results were exported from the quality check module. Analysis was performed using a custom R script (v. 3.6.0) in RStudio (v. 1.3.959) to filter amplified results using the following cut-off values: amplification score >1.2 and Crt confidence >0.7. Samples were further filtered on reaction-specific Crt cut-off values determined in a LOD experiment (Supplementary Table 1). The TrueMark Respiratory Panel 2.0 includes technical control assays for human RNase P (RPPH1) and human 18S ribosomal RNA.

TrueMark respiratory panel limit-of-detection estimation using contrived air samples

Contrived air samples were prepared using the TrueMark Respiratory Panel 2.0 Amplification Control (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to estimate the limit of detection (LOD) of the TrueMark Respiratory Panel 2.0 TaqMan Array Card. Briefly two air cartridges were collected in an office for 48 h each. The air cartridge substrates were processed and total nucleic acids were isolated as described above. Eluates from the four substrates were pooled together and aliquoted into five tubes. TrueMark amplification control plasmid initially diluted in nuclease-free water was added to four tubes at dilutions of 50 copies/µL 10 copies/µL 2.5 copies/µL and 0.25 copies/µL. Final template concentrations for the preamplification reaction were 250 50 12.5 and 1.25 copies per reaction respectively. No amplification control plasmid was added to the fifth tube that was used to determine the targets present in the background of contrived air samples collected from the empty office. An unused air cartridge was processed with the air samples as a negative template control. Four replicates of each contrived sample and control were processed through the reverse transcription pre-amplification dilution and PCR protocols as described above. Data were analyzed in Thermo Fisher Design and Analysis Software 2.6.0 according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Replicates were called positive using the following cut-off values: amplification score >1.2 and Crt confidence >0.7. Cycle relative threshold (Crt) cut-off values were determined by averaging the Crt values of positive replicates at the lowest dilution concentration with at least 75% positive replicates. Any reaction targets that were detected in the contrived air sample or not detected at the highest amplification control dilution were excluded from the analysis and Crt cut-off values defaulted to the manufacturer’s recommendation of Crt > 30.

Nucleic acid extraction and RT-qPCR

To elute the sample from the AerosolSense cartridges both substrates were placed into 1 mL of PBS making sure the substrates were fully saturated with PBS. A pipette was used to push down on the substrates to extract as much eluate out of them as possible. Eluate was then transferred to a new tube. Samples were extracted using the Quick-RNA Viral Kit (Zymo Research). The extraction method followed manufacturer-recommended protocols with the notable exceptions of using 100 µL of starting material and eluting with 65 µL of appropriate elution material as indicated by manufacturer protocols. RT-qPCR reactions were set up in a 96-well Barcoded plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for either the N1 or N2 primers and probes with CDC-recommended sequences74. Then 5 µL extracted RNA was added to 15 µL qPCR master mix comprised of the following components: 8.5 µL nuclease-free water 5 µL TaqMan™ Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1.5 µL primer/probe sets for either N1 or N2 (IDT Cat# 10006713). SARS-CoV-2 RNA Control was obtained from Twist Biosciences (Genbank Ref. No. MN908947.3) and used as a positive control in each run. Reactions were cycled in a QuantStudio QS3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for one cycle of 50 °C for 5 min followed by one cycle of 95 °C for 20 s followed by 50 cycles of 95 °C for 3 s and 55 °C for 30 s. A minimum of two no-template controls were included on all runs. Baselines were allowed to calculate automatically and a ΔRn threshold of 0.5 was selected and set uniformly for all runs. Ct values were exported and analyzed in Microsoft Excel. Amplification curves were manually reviewed. Samples with Ct < 40 in both N1 and N2 reactions were determined as positive for SARS-CoV-2. In contrast samples with Ct < 40 in only N1 or N2 targets were determined as inconclusive results and samples without amplification in both N1 and N2 targets were deemed negative for SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain sequencing

Targeted sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) was performed as previously described27. Primers used to amplify the spike RBD region for Illumina Miseq sequencing are shown in Supplementary Table 3. The data were analyzed using a custom workflow implemented in Snakemake and is publicly available at https://github.com/dholab/SARS-CoV-2-Spike-RBD-Analysis75. Briefly paired-end reads were interleaved and merged into synthetic reads spanning the entire RBD PCR amplicon using bbmerge.sh (v38.93) from the bbtools package (sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/) with default parameters. The merged reads were mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence (Genbank MN908947.3) using minimap2 (v2.24) with the “-ax sr” preset for short reads. The resulting mapping file was sorted with samtools (v1.14). Reads that fully contain the desired amplicon sequence were extracted with the bedtools (v2.30.0) intersect tool. These reads were then downsampled to a target depth of 1000 reads using reformat.sh (v38.93) from the bbtools package. These downsampled reads were remapped to the MN908947.3 reference with minimap2. Residual PCR primer sequences were then trimmed with samtools ampliconclip using the “-hard-clip -both-ends” parameters. Next a consensus sequence was generated by first generating a pileup with the samtools mpileup tool using default settings and then generating a consensus with ivar (v1.3.1) using the parameters “-q 20 -t 0 -m 20”.

At the same time a consensus sequence was generated the primer-trimmed reads were deduplicated to determine how many of the reads were identical essentially defining pseudo-haplotypes. Vsearch (v2.21.1) fastx_uniques tool was used for deduplicating and enumerating the number of identical reads in each sample.

Lineage-defining mutations in the RBD were used to differentiate Delta from Omicron consensus sequences. Only one sample had evidence of mixed Delta and Omicron sequences.

The first surprise: the top 300 meters of the subsurface beneath the landing site near the Martian equator contains little or no ice.

“We find that Mars’ crust is weak and porous. The sediments are not well-cemented. And there’s no ice or not much ice filling the pore spaces” said geophysicist Vashan Wright of Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego. Wright and three co-authors published their analysis in Geophysical Research Letters.

“These findings don’t preclude that there could be grains of ice or small balls of ice that are not cementing other minerals together” said Wright. “The question is how likely is ice to be present in that form?”

The second surprise contradicts a leading idea about what happened to the water on Mars. The red planet may have harbored oceans of water early in its history. Many experts suspected that much of the water became part of the minerals that make up underground cement.

“If you put water in contact with rocks you produce a brand-new set of minerals like clay so the water’s not a liquid. It’s part of the mineral structure” said study co-author Michael Manga of the University of California (UC) Berkeley. “There is some cement but the rocks are not full of cement.”

“Water may also go into minerals that do not act as cement. But the uncemented subsurface removes one way to preserve a record of life or biological activity” Wright said. Cements by their very nature hold rocks and sediments together protecting them from destructive erosion.

The lack of cemented sediments suggests a water scarcity in the 300 meters below InSight’s landing site near the equator. The below-freezing average temperature at the Mars equator means that conditions would be cold enough to freeze water if it were there.

Many planetary scientists including Manga have long suspected that the Martian subsurface would be full of ice. Their suspicions have melted away. Still big ice sheets and frozen ground ice remain at the Martian poles.

“As scientists we’re now confronted with the best data the best observations. And our models predicted that there should still be frozen ground at that latitude with aquifers underneath” said Manga professor and chair of Earth and planetary science at UC Berkeley.

The InSight spacecraft landed on Elysium Planitia a flat smooth plain near the Martian equator in 2018. Its instruments included a seismometer that measures vibrations caused by marsquakes and crashing meteorites.

Scientists can tie this information to a huge mass of knowledge about the surface including images of Martian landforms and temperature data. The surface data suggested that the subsurface might consist of sedimentary rock and lava flows. Still the team had to account for uncertainties about subsurface properties such as porosity and mineral content.

Seismic waves from marsquakes provide clues to the nature of the materials they travel through. Possible cementing minerals—such as calcite clay kaolinite and gypsum—affect seismic velocities. Wright’s team at Scripps Oceanography applied rock physics computer modeling to interpret the velocities derived from the InSight data.

“We ran our models 10000 times each to get the uncertainties incorporated into our answers” said co-author Richard Kilburn a graduate student working in the Scripps Tectonorockphysics Lab led by Wright. Simulations showing a subsurface consisting mostly of uncemented material best fit the data.

Scientists want to probe the subsurface because if life exists on Mars that is where it would be. There is no liquid water on the surface and subsurface life would be protected from radiation. Following a sample-return mission a NASA priority for the next decade is the Mars Life Explorer mission concept. The goal is to drill two meters into the Martian crust at high latitude to search for life where ice rock and the atmosphere come together.

Already under consideration is the proposed international robotic Mars Ice Mapper Mission to help NASA identify potential science goals for the first human missions to Mars. Scripps Oceanography helps prepare young scientists to contribute to such missions.

“All my life growing up I’ve heard the Earth may become uninhabitable” said study co-author Jhardel Dasent another graduate student in the lab Wright leads. “I’m at the age now where I can contribute to producing the knowledge of another planet that may get us there.”

This research was funded by the National Science Foundation NASA and the CIFAR Earth 4D program.

The @BasedMikeLee Twitter account is actually Sen. Mike Lee — for real.,"(Trent Nelson | The Salt Lake Tribune) Sen. Mike Lee at the ribbon cutting ceremony for Thermo Fisher Scientific's Ogden facility on Wednesday April 20 2022. Lee is the author of the new Twitter account ""Based Mike Lee.""

Parody accounts have become ubiquitous especially in politics on Twitter. Utah political Twitter is rife with accounts lampooning elected officials like for example Fake Governor Cox. Others like State of Utah Updates can be hard to distinguish from the real thing. Utah political veterans will remember the “Snowball” parody account that popped up during the 2011 Utah Legislature in response to proposed legislation to allow the shooting of feral cats.

When the “Based Mike Lee” Twitter account popped up late last month it was easy to dismiss it as just another parody account especially with such cringeworthy bon mots as “The haters can’t handle this frickin’ smoke” and “This account is no cap — bussin forreal forreal.”

The haters can’t handle this frickin’ smoke — Mike Lee (@BasedMikeLee) July 24 2022

This account is no cap — bussin forreal forreal https://t.co/sMJDQ4yiRS — Mike Lee (@BasedMikeLee) July 24 2022

Except it wasn’t a parody.

The account is controlled by sitting U.S. Senator and self-styled constitutional scholar Mike Lee. His ownership of the social media property was confirmed to The Salt Lake Tribune on Tuesday.

Unlike Sen. Mitt Romney’s alleged anonymous “Pierre Delecto” account Lee makes no attempts to hide his identity. He uses a picture of himself for his avatar. His bio reads “I’m a U.S. senator from Utah.”

The first post on the account was July 24 in response to Prince Harry’s speech at the United Nations where the member of the royal family was critical of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

“Love being lectured on democracy by an actual prince” Lee tweeted.

Love being lectured on democracy by an actual prince. https://t.co/9MmV8R3eXE — Mike Lee (@BasedMikeLee) July 24 2022

The creation of Lee’s account seemingly coincides with his speech last month at the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit in Florida. Conservative commentator Benny Johnson highlighted Lee’s new account to help him gain followers which prompted Lee’s “bussin” response.

The account creates a sort of cognitive dissonance. The same person who has been relentlessly promoting his book about the Supreme Court posted a picture of himself photoshopped wearing 8-bit sunglasses from the “Deal With It” meme that was popular more than a decade ago.

Lee’s stilted efforts at embracing youth culture is reminiscent of Steve Buscemi’s undercover cop character from 30 Rock attempting to pass as a teenager with the now famous “How do you do fellow kids?” clip.

Lee’s edgy posts ended that same day with a boast that he’s taller than Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul.

Since Lee has used his new handle to attack Democrats in Congress and the Biden administration while also taking some shots at his November election opponent independent candidate Evan McMullin. Lee even threatened to sue McMullin in response to a tweet about the FBI search of former President Donald Trump’s home at Mar-a-Lago in Florida.

“If I’d conspired with a guy whose home is now being invaded by the FBI I’d be worried...” McMullin asked tagging Lee’s official congressional Twitter account.

“I’d also be worried if I had repeatedly engaged in actionable defamation against a political opponent falsely accusing him of grave offenses while acting with reckless disregard for the truth. Stick to the truth or lawyer up” Lee responded.

It’s not clear why Lee felt the need to launch another Twitter account. His congressional and campaign accounts both carry the blue verified badge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhYm1hdGUtb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xhYm9yYXRvcnktcHJvZHVjdHMvMy9icmVha2luZy1uZXdzL2hvdy10by1zdGFydC1hLXJlc2VhcmNoLWxhYi1hbGwtYmFzZXMtY292ZXJlZC81ODQ5MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Start a Research Lab - All Bases Covered,"From government-run public research centres to high-throughput drug discovery facilities operated by pharma giants like Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson laboratories come in a myriad of shapes and sizes. Setting up a research lab is an exciting endeavour for any scientist and comes with a unique set of challenges and responsibilities. Below we take a closer look at how to start a research laboratory what to expect and how to maximise the chances of success.

Budgets overheads and astronomical costs

Cost is a major factor when starting a research lab. Even the smallest and simplest facilities require significant overheads to get up and running. While every laboratory is different there are some universal costs associated with starting a research facility:

Specialised equipment

Equipment is a major expense for research labs. For example a pharma lab may need to allocate funds to purchase a next-generation X-Pulse benchtop NMR spectrometer.

Supplies

From bases buffers and acids to solvents and reagents supplies are another big expense.

Outfitting laboratory workspaces

Installing benches plumbing in wash stations and purchasing furniture are significant expenses faced by new labs.

Staff salaries

Whether hiring qualified postdoctoral researchers or university students staff salaries will take up a large portion of the budget.

Instrument user fees and maintenance contracts

Instrument user fees maintenance contracts and other “hidden” expenses must be factored into the budget when setting up a research lab.

Unsurprisingly the costs of starting a research lab vary enormously depending on the type of facility being set up. For example at the high end of the spectrum is the International Space Station (ISS). The facility cost around US$150 billion to construct making it one of the most expensive scientific laboratories ever built. Not only does it boast state-of-the-art equipment and instruments but it’s located more than 200 miles above Earth and travels through space at speeds of over 17000 miles per hour. Within the ISS are pressurised modules where scientists carry out astronomy and meteorology research as well as experiments in physics pharma human biology and more.

Sourcing funding for a research lab

Even small-scale laboratories demand big setup costs. Luckily many governments offer funding designed to kickstart operations. For example the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) World Class Laboratories Fund allocated £88 million in the 2020/2021 financial year to support research institutes and university facilities. The goal is to ensure British scientists have access to industry-leading facilities instruments equipment and resources.

Laboratories in the United States are also heavily reliant on government grants from organisations like the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. Other labs secure funding from non-profit organisations in niche areas such as the Breast Cancer Research Foundation.

“As a society we reap the rewards from this science in the form of technological innovations and advanced knowledge but we also help pay for it” states the Understanding Science document published by the University of California at Berkeley in collaboration with the National Science Foundation. “You indirectly support science everyday through taxes you pay products and services you purchase from companies and donations you make to charities. Something as simple as buying a bottle of aspirin may help foot the bill for multiple sclerosis research.”

Check out the article 'Why UK participation in Horizon Europe matters to you' for more on scientific funding.

Funding for the greater good

A new research laboratory set up in Philadelphia underscores how government grants help support public health. Funded by grants from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention the laboratory was set up by the Philadelphia Department of Public Health and studies the genetic makeup of COVID variants. Thanks to funding the lab can sequence up to 60 samples per week with plans to increase to 300 as the facility grows.

Maximising a Laboratory Startup Package

Ideally a scientists will receive a startup package when setting up a research lab. This lump sum is designed to cover the costs of setting up a new laboratory from scratch. Funds vary depending on the institution offering the startup package and the type of laboratory being set up. Generally most scientists can expect to receive a startup package of between US$1 and US$1.5 million to last between three and five years.

Budgeting is essential as this helps ensure all costs can be covered. Budgets will need to factor in the specific needs of the laboratory. For example a medical research lab may incur unique expenses like animal housing.

Take advantage of startup programs

Many industry-leading providers offer startup programs designed to help kickstart new laboratories. For example the New Lab Start-Up Program offered by Fisher Scientific offers exclusive access to special offers and discounts for 12 months. These types of programs help stretch startup budgets as far as possible.

Tips for setting up a successful research lab

Every scientific laboratory is unique. A one-size-fits-all approach can’t be applied when setting up a facility. However there are some general principles that can be used to maximise success:

Invest in high-quality equipment

New scientific discoveries are driven by state-of-the-art equipment. Around the world scientists rely on cutting-edge devices instruments and equipment to make new breakthroughs. For example the latest Octagon 200CL sieve shaker from British-based laboratory equipment supplier Endecotts is one of the most advanced in the world. Game-changing features like ‘closed loop’ amplitude control for superlative reproducibility and an electromagnetic drive with no rotating parts to minimise maintenance set a new standard for sieve shakers.

Invest in smart data management solutions

From liquid-handling robotics to DNA sequencing software high-throughput technologies allow modern labs to unlock a huge amount of data. Investing in smart data management solutions is critical when setting up a research lab particularly for high-throughput facilities. Without the right solutions in place raw data can’t be converted into useful information.

Thermo Fisher is a global leader in Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) designed to track data and improve efficiency productivity and workflows. The company describes modern LIMS as the “digital backbone of the lab” and offers solutions for all sectors from biopharma to metals and mining.

“A LIMS does more than just keep track of your sample information scientific data and results. It allows you to actively manage your entire lab process from instrument maintenance and samples to people and consumables” reads the Thermo Fisher website. “A LIMS manages laboratory samples and associated data standardizes workflows reduces human error and increases efficiency.”

A good LIMS solution should offer the following capabilities:

Sample management

Instrument management

Inventory management

Laboratory operations management

Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) compliance

Workflow management capabilities

Lab automation functions

Data sharing capabilities to support collaboration

Integration and connectivity with other laboratory systems

Access to cloud-based storage

Compliance with industry regulations

Advanced security features to protect data

Mobile capabilities to support field work

Data visualisation

Detailed reports and data analytics

Data archiving solutions

Embrace ‘Lab of the Future’ technologies

The Lab of the Future describes a group of technologies and innovations reimagining the limits of modern facilities. Embracing Lab of the Future concepts is one of the best ways to accelerate progress when starting a research lab. Here are the core concepts to consider:

Connectivity

Technologies such as advanced LIMS software and Electronic Laboratory Notebooks (ELN) to support instant access to data. These types of technologies also support data sharing and collaboration.

Unlimited data

Cloud-based storage solutions allow for unlimited data generation. This is especially valuable for high-throughput labs.

The Internet of Things

The internet of things (IoT) equips physical objects with the capacity to communicate and exchange data. In the Lab of the Future the IoT will reimagine how information is shared between instruments and systems.

Strategic lab design

Co-working is front and centre in the Lab of the Future. When starting a research lab traditional layouts should be swapped for strategic designs that support collaboration and teamwork.

Artificial intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a mainstay in the Lab of the Future. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms also have a critical role to play.

Automation and robotics

The unification of automation and robotics will allow the Lab of the Future to access high-quality data. The goal is to allow scientists to focus on research and innovation as opposed to manual tasks.

Wearable technology

Virtual Reality (VR) headsets and Augmented Reality (AR) systems will reimagine how scientists analyse data in the Lab of the Future.

Allocate administration time

All laboratories will face significant administrative work during the first few months. It’s important to allocate adequate administration time when starting a research lab. This will help streamline operations and reduce stress.

Work with a centralised chemicals supplier

Stocking up on chemicals is one of the biggest expenses new laboratories must absorb. In the UK Scientific Laboratory Supplies (SLS) is one of the largest and most trusted independent suppliers of chemicals and works with respected manufacturers across the globe. Working with a centralised supplier eliminates the hassle of locating receiving and unpacking multiple orders from different chemical companies.

Find out more about the benefits of a single contact and get to know some of the different brands and products offered by SLS in ‘Think Chemicals. Think SLS.’"

This is an incredibly challenging situation and we are working closely with local officials to make sure people have the help they need as they begin the long road to recovery. Some areas remain cut off due to damaged roads and bridges and Red Cross disaster workers are bringing food and relief supplies to people by boat. Preliminary damage reports indicate that nearly 1400 homes were either destroyed or suffered major damage.

RED CROSS RESPONSE Today some 400 trained Red Cross disaster workers are on the ground in Kentucky helping to provide a safe place to stay food to eat critical relief supplies and emotional support for those affected by this tragedy. Volunteers are also replacing prescription medications eyeglasses or critical medical equipment like canes and wheelchairs which were left behind in the rush to get to safety.

Wednesday night the Red Cross and our partners provided comfort and care for more than 430 residents in 13 shelters across Eastern Kentucky. Since the flooding hit the region the Red Cross and our partners have provided a total of nearly 6000 overnight stays for residents forced to leave their homes. More than a dozen Red Cross emergency response vehicles are circulating through the hardest hit communities with volunteers providing meals and cleanup supplies.

With the support of local partners the Red Cross has helped to provide some 81000 meals and snacks to people in need. In addition we’ve given out thousands of critical relief items to over 1400 households.

Red Cross care teams are meeting with families who have lost loved ones to offer specialized support including disaster mental health services and other information.

FIND A SHELTER To find an open shelter visit redcross.org/shelter or view open shelters through the Red Cross Emergency app. If you don’t have access to a computer or smart phone call 1-800-RED CROSS (800-733-2767) to be directed to sheltering options near you. Alternatively try calling 211 or 311 if these services are available in your area.

YOU CAN HELP people affected by disasters like floods fires and countless other crises by making a gift to Red Cross Disaster Relief. Donations enable the Red Cross to prepare for respond to and help people recover from disasters big and small. Visit redcross.org call 1-800-RED CROSS or text the word REDCROSS to 90999 to make a $10 donation.

For those interested in helping people specifically affected by the recent floods we ask that they write “Kentucky floods” in the memo line of a check and mail it to their local Red Cross chapter with a completed donation form to the address on the form or to their local Red Cross chapter. Find the donation form at redcross.org/donate.

The Red Cross stands ready to provide blood and blood products as needed in response to disasters of all sizes. Blood can take up to three days to be tested processed and made available for patients so it’s the blood already on the shelves that helps save lives in an emergency. We encourage eligible individuals in unaffected areas to make an appointment to give blood by using the Red Cross Blood Donor App visiting redcrossblood.org or calling 1-800-RED CROSS to help ensure a sufficient blood supply.

This deadly flooding — along with the heavy rainfall in Missouri explosive wildfires in California and the recent heatwaves — are clear examples of how more intense climate-rated disasters are happening more often and are leaving behind devastation.

Over the last two years on average the Red Cross has responded to a new major disaster every 10 days. We see firsthand how families and communities are suffering and depending on us for help with our volunteers continuously on the ground setting up shelters arranging for hot meals and offering comfort for people forced from their homes.

One of the latest projects a WellNow Urgent Care opened its doors in Alpena Township on Wednesday and the neighboring Starbucks is slated to open by the end of the month.

Alpena Area Chamber of Commerce Economic Development Director Mike Mahler said those two projects may be at the tail end of their construction but there are other projects that continue to progress behind the scenes.

Those projects include a Marshalls and a proposed Fairfield Inn and Suites by Marriott that could be built in downtown Alpena.

MARSHALLS

The new 22365 square-foot store will be owned by Alpena Retail North LLC and built on the property between Alpena Alcona Area Credit Union and the Meijer entrance on Bagley Street. Some of the materials have been delivered to the site and construction should begin very soon.

Marshalls — which is owned by TJX Companies and has more than 1000 locations in the United States — should open in Alpena in 2023.

FAIRFIELD INN AND SUITES by MARRIOTT

The proposed five or six story hotel if built would have about 70 rooms and include all of the amenities guests expect Mahler said.

The Alpena Municipal Council voted to approve a Brownfield plan to help cover the cost of the pollution that must be addressed before any construction can begin.

The property is owned by Target Alpena which has a purchase agreement with hotel developer Pranvay Inc which could build the hotel on the shore of the Thunder Bay River.

Mahler said the engineering plans for the hotel are still being drafted and once they are completed an accurate cost for the project can be projected.

Mahler said once the developer knows how much it will cost then the project can begin to move forward more quickly.

“They have put a lot of time and money into this so that tells us they are serious” he said. “They just have to continue to put all the puzzle pieces together.”

ALDI

Constructing an Aldi where Alpena Public Schools’ bus garage is has been a consideration for several years.

The same developer constructing the Marshalls has expressed interest in building the grocery store on the M-32 property in exchange for a new bus garage built by the developer near Park Family Field at Wildcat Stadium at Alpena High School.

The property where the current bus garage is has significant environmental issues however and the developer has asked the school district to help cover the cost of clean-up. The school district has been reluctant to do so.

Mahler said as far as he knows the school district and the developer haven’t spoken about the project in a while and he is beginning to think the store or a new bus garage won’t be constructed.

“I suspect that project might not make sense for the developer anymore but I don’t know that for sure” Mahler said. “I’m not sure we’ll ever see an Aldi built there.”

Bought a pork shoulder for my pulled pork recipe because the local supermarket didn't have my preferred cut a bone-in pork butt.

Not a perfect substitute but after 10 hours in the slow cooker it promised to be delicious.

Thirty minutes before our friends were to arrive for the highly anticipated pork dinner modeled after Tony Luke's famous roast pork sandwich my wife Jodi and I smelled something a bit off.

At first we thought it was in the kitchen trash. Nope. Then I thought it was something in the fridge. Nope.

Opening the slow cooker we realized it was the pork.

Somewhat in denial considering the expiration date was Aug. 22 and I bought it the day before we conclude it was the fat cap only. So I pulled it off and trashed it.

A few minutes later after I tasted the pork and again concluded it was fine my son entered the kitchen and asked what that awful smell was. The pork was the culprit for sure couldn't deny it.

Out it went and then the mad dash to order pizza to go with the sides and salad that were to accompany my almost famous recipe.

My conclusion from all this? No more supermarkets or big box store meat for us.

We are going to carve out a weekly trip to a local farm or delivery service for a few months of meat to stock the freezer. Here are three great places shared by our listeners!

“There's an entire industry beyond the physical growing of crops” explained Kevin Dennis general manager of the De Pue Warehouse Co. in Williams during a recent drought briefing hosted by the Northern California Water Association (NCWA). “When the farmer doesn't grow the warehouses don't dry and store the mills don't mill trucking companies have nothing to ship parts and fertilizer vendors don't make sales and aviators have nothing to fly onto the fields.”

Dennis reported seeds sales were down as much as 85% for De Pue the nation’s largest independent drying and storage company with 14 rice facilities along the I-5 corridor. As one of the primary seed providers for the Sacramento Valley the company projects it will have just 10% of its regular volume at harvest. If the drought were to end this year it would not have enough seed for farmers in the next growing season.

After striking a deal with state and federal water agencies last spring Sacramento River Settlement Contractors received just 14% of their water allocation far below the 75% previously guaranteed in dry years. With such a minimal and unreliable water supply many growers chose to sell their water back to local irrigation districts and instead fallow their land according to Don Bransford who farms 1200 acres of almonds prunes and rice and serves on the board of the Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District.

“When you grow rice you have to have a reliable supply of water. If it's interrupted and your field goes dry weeds can take over and you lose your crop” said Bransford. “It was too big of a risk for growers to take.”

Farmer Don Bransford a former member of the State Board of Food and Agriculture In a normal year his district plants 100000 acres of rice accounting for 20% of the state’s crop. But this year it has just 1000 acres with most of the water allocation going to permanent crops. The irrigation district is now facing an $11 million deficit.

California’s total rice crop typically spans about 500000 acres. But the latest estimates cut that in half. As a result UC agricultural economists projected in May that the Sacramento Valley would lose $1.3 billion in economic value and more than 14000 jobs this year.

“We've experienced drought before” said Denise Carter a Colusa County supervisor who runs a 3000-acre diversified farm. “But never has our surface water been cut like it has this year.”

Combined with a freeze in February during bloom the drought will reduce the county’s almond crop by $210 million.

Farmers in her county have turned to groundwater pumping contributing to the decline of aquifer levels and the first subsidence issues in the region according to Carter who complained that a significant amount of water still flows south through the county to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to protect endangered and threatened fish populations.

Yet other wildlife in the valley is struggling. After the Central Valley Project came online decades ago the Bureau of Reclamation committed to allocate more water to growers with senior water rights at risk along the Sacramento River. Flooded rice fields in turn became surrogate wetlands for the floodplains that once dominated the valley in winter and spring housing millions of migratory waterfowl along the Pacific Flyway.

With so few rice acres in production this year large flocks are instead crowding into tight clusters around the little water that is available creating an environment ripe for diseases to spread rapidly. Last month three of the wild birds tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza a deadly disease that has heavily impacted domestic poultry flocks while wild birds can usually fend off the bird flu.

“That is just gigantic” said Bransford adding that—despite the dedicated water allotments—the plight of native salmon populations may not be fully realized until the remaining salmon return to spawn years from now.

The drought has taken a toll on the mental health of Californians as well with Carter observing more residents seeking services to treat depression.

“There's frustration of course” said CDFA Secretary Karen Ross during a meeting last week for the State Board of Food and Agriculture. “But there's also just the emotional impact of this which we've seen numerous times in the Central Valley. This is new for this particular community.”

Ross who recently visited Colusa County to survey the damage and talk with growers hinted that USDA Under Secretary Robert Bonnie may squeeze in a trip to California further elevating the issue.

Like Dennis Nick Biscay worried about California agriculture’s long-term future once the drought subsides. As president and CEO of Stanislaus Farm Supply Biscay has noticed that national companies have been closing their regional locations throughout the state. In December an alfalfa and forage seed cooperative permanently closed its service center in Fresno County and relocated the inventory to Idaho which has led to higher costs and less availability for seeds further exacerbating supply chain issues. The cooperative cited the severe drought as well as “a perception that water allocations for agriculture are a low priority in California” according to Biscay.

The drought along with delayed water allocation decisions and overall water uncertainty has led to “catastrophic declines” in fertilizer sales this year for Stanislaus Farm Supply. Sales for the fundamental elements for producing fertilizer are also down as much as 67% and the company is facing a significant downside risk for the fertilizer it has not sold.

A sudden drop in pesticide use has had repercussions as well reducing sales tax revenue and mill assessment funding for Colusa County’s “already very tight” budget according to Carter who hoped that property values remain strong to avoid yet another hit to a pillar of the county budget.

“For our members—who are the agricultural retailers the applicators irrigation companies—they're at a tipping point” said Renee Pinel president and CEO of the Western Plant Health Association.

Without those services farmers will not have the pest control products when they need them leading to practices that are less agronomically and environmentally sound explained Pinel.

While crop insurance covers prevented planting and frost damage for most crops not all commodities such as processing tomatoes and vine seeds have coverage. And the industries supporting farmers have no such fallback.

“Those are the folks that need to be there when we start farming our crops again” said Tim Johnson California Rice Commission president and CEO.

Colusa County Supervisor Denise Carter He applauded Ross’ efforts in securing drought relief for small agricultural businesses within Gov. Gavin Newsom’s budget proposal which the Legislature is set to approve in the coming weeks. The one-time assistance would offer grants ranging from $30000 to $50000 depending on the amount of lost revenue. Don’t miss a beat! It’s easy to sign up for a FREE month of Agri-Pulse news!

“We are building—and have nearly perfected—a delivery mechanism here in California with that $75 million grant program” said Johnson who hoped to expand the eligibility and increase the grant amounts through federal block grants. “We really appreciate that leadership from California.”

Agriculture groups and water districts are developing “an aggressive and very detailed list of asks” according to Johnson. The spending could come from a package of bills called the Wildfire Response and Drought Resiliency Act from the $4 billion in drought-related funding attached to the Senate climate package from existing money in USDA disaster assistance programs or from new bills introduced after Congress returns from recess in September. He shared that California Rep. Mike Thompson has been interested in an employee retention tax credit which “worked really well” at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Bransford noted that “it doesn't appear the state of California is interested” in such a credit. Adding to Johnson’s requests he pushed for a more comprehensive crop insurance program that covers all impacted commodities and speculated that even those farmers who would fall within the coverage but chose not to buy into it stand to get some payments for last year’s disaster since “situations are so bad.”

NCWA President David Guy called for more long-term investments to better prepare the Sacramento River watershed for another dry year such as more support for the Sites Reservoir Project proposal in the valley and any efforts to get more groundwater recharge projects up and ready for the next rains.

Guy has been closely engaged in restoration projects to revitalize salmon populations but hoped to find a better balance in state and federal wildlife priorities and condemned an “inordinate focus on temperature management” along the upper Sacramento River.

“That hasn't been a very fruitful conversation in our view” said Guy before outlining NCWA’s requests for floodplain restoration better management of fish hatcheries restoring side channels for fish passage and balancing the needs of salmon with those of birds and other terrestrial species along the flyway.

Carter agreed with Guy on more funding for Sites and groundwater recharge and called for direct aid to businesses rather than grants—since it will take years to recover from the disaster—along with support in training the workforce for advanced new technologies.

Above all she called for more attention to the importance of farmers.

“Society and government must place higher priority on U.S. food production” she said. “We do it best. I believe—really truly believe—it's important to our national security.”

“I was his secretary his loader his unloader his mixer. I mean he was the owner I was every title below that” she said.

Her father Herb Surber passed away at age 84 on July 30 in his Marfa home. He was in the process of closing Surber Ade an 8000 square-foot feed store he operated on San Antonio Street since the 1980s. His customers consisted primarily of local cattle ranchers and more recently birders and other wildlife buffs. Robbin said her father struggled with his mobility in the end but said he didn’t want to retire and that working kept him going.

“He lived a simple life. He bought what he needed. He didn’t buy what he wanted. He was a very simple man. He didn’t splurge” said Robbin. “He worked up to nine days before he died.”

Robbin closed the doors to her father’s business for the final time this past weekend after running a sale on remaining feed. Routine customers streamed in for their discounts but also to give their condolences and visit one last time. All that remained in the shop were small stacks of feed along the periphery a hammermill mixer and auger — equipment Herb used to make his specially formulated feed — and a couple of forklifts.

“We’d bag it weigh it sew it and stack it” said Robbin. “I enjoyed working in here. It was a lot of fun. Even though it was dusty and dirty and you left here filthy. There were a lot of good people that would come in and talk.”

Just off the main warehouse space was Herb’s office which was mostly cleared out with the exception of a desk with piles of paper a couple of chairs and a deer antler chandelier he made but never got around to hanging. The space itself is colored by local lore — it was built on concrete forms that remained from the 1940s when German prisoner of war camps were stationed at the site said Robbin.

Robbin recalled her and her father’s visits with customers where they’d sit around and “hold court” in Herb’s office on the couch swapping old ranching stories. He’d give advice and relive the glory days of growing up in the Texas Hill Country choppin’ cedar and breakin’ horses.

“I heard those stories over and over and over. They liked telling them and then embellishing on them a little bit more each time. It was great” said Robbin.

Surber Ade and the accompanying lots are now for sale. Robbin said her father was looking for a buyer but didn’t mind if the property lingered on the market — he liked an excuse to get out and visit with folks at the store. Looking around in the space Robbin reflected on the time spent running the feed store with her dad.

“Sad to see what it looks like now when I know what it used to be — just full of feed the work we did and the customers that would come in and it was a lot of fun. It was a lot of work. But it was a lot of fun. You’re sitting inside so you didn’t have to worry about getting sunburned” Robbin laughed.

The Surber family moved to Far West Texas from Blanco in 1974 when Robbin was 2 years old. Herb is survived by Robbin and his other daughter Lauren and preceded in death by his wife Dorothy May. Herb worked for local ranches including Ryan Ranch west of town and gained experience developing feed that worked for the area’s cattle. He learned to speak Spanish from two young boys who came across the border from Mexico to work and send money home to their families. He taught them English in return said Robbin. Given his rich ranching background when looking for his next move in life he decided to open up a local feed store.

“‘I know what cattle need. I know how to make it’” Robbin recalled her father saying. “So that’s what he did.”

Herb made and sold mineral for cattle and was well known for his recipes and formulas crafting tailor-made mineral and feed and selling to people all over from Canada to New Mexico to East Texas. He also worked to share his knowledge with doctors universities and associations.

He was born in 1938 on the heels of the Great Depression an experience which helped shape him said Robbin. Herb was good at fixing and making things and diversified his business throughout the years fabricating gates and feed troughs and offering a wall full of tack or supplies. He was well known for his reasonable prices.

“He did not believe in marking anything up any higher than what it needed to be” said Robbin.

“He [was] in the business to make money but also understood that a lot of these ranchers they didn’t make a lot of money and he wanted to keep them in business.”

Marfa which was once home to a number of animal feed stores now has just one: Livingston’s. Robbin who lives in Missouri said she would have kept Surber Ade open if the business hadn’t dwindled so much due to fewer cattle ranches operating in the area. The coronavirus pandemic also further complicated the business with supply chain delays she said.

“Back in the day there were so many ranches every piece of ground in town was a ranch. He did really good for a really long time and then as one generation of rancher passed down to his son that one was like ‘I don’t want to do this it’s too hard.’ So then they’d sell that ranch to some rich person from California or San Antonio or wherever” said Robbin.

Herb was eager to lend a hand to anyone in the local community who needed to borrow a trailer truck forklift or any other equipment from him and even gave out loans and free feed saying “Merry Christmas” no matter the time of year. He’d accept deliveries at Surber Ade for people because he had a dock. In return he’d be gifted a pie or loaf of banana bread being known for his sweet tooth.

“He was a very generous man” said Robbin. “And not everybody paid him back and not everybody returned everything in the condition that he lent it out in.”

When a bad drought caused a lot of ranchers to sell their land and move on from the area her father encouraged one man to stick with it and supplied him with free feed for three years.

“He kept that man in business. And he still has cattle” said Robbin. “That’s how he was”

James Spriggs 76 was more than just a customer of Herb’s for 30 years — he was also a close friend. He spent holidays like Thanksgiving with the Surber family and Herb would come help his wife during calf birthing season if he was out of town. He and Herb lost their wives within a year of each other.

Spriggs said operations like Surber Ade — where the owner would offer special deals for his customers — are now few and far between. Herb will be sorely missed he said and there is no one to take his place.

“He was just one of those [people] that was concerned about the community and took care of his customers” said Spriggs. “The mom and pop operations have gone by the wayside over the years there’s hardly any of us that have been able to survive. Kind of like ranches in general.”

Spriggs said unlike the big box stores like Tractor Supply and Walmart Surber Ade was more affordable and friendly and collaborative with people dropping in to talk ask questions and compare notes on things.

“A lot of us that are smaller operations could stay in business with people like Herb because he always treated you a little more fairly and didn’t have any stockholders to pay off or anything like that” said Spriggs.

Robbin said Herb’s goal after selling Surber Ade was to purchase some land off of Casa Piedra Road and make a birder’s haven planting milo and building a couple of tiny homes for people to come stay and appreciate the wildlife of the Big Bend.

“That was going to be his next big adventure to sell this place and open up where people could go walk and walk through nature and see birds” said Robbin.

For Spriggs his dear friend’s passing represents the sunsetting of a certain breed of Big Bend character — cowboys with grit and honesty as many of their kind have left the cattle ranching industry for greener pastures.

“There just aren’t any cowboys left out here” said Spriggs. “The droughts have run them all off. They’ve had to go to driving trucks and working in the oil patch and it’s just a dying breed and Herb was one of the real stars.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vbmoxMDE1LmNvbS9wcm9wb3NlZC1ob21lbGVzcy1zaGVsdGVyLWluLWZsZW1pbmd0b24tbmotaGFzLXBlb3BsZS1mdW1pbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Proposed homeless shelter in Flemington has people fuming,"This is one of those moments that should make you stare deep into your soul.

People in Flemington were expected to pack a public meeting Tuesday night over a proposed homeless shelter in a nice residential neighborhood.

The house at 8 New York Ave. is owned by the Cavalry Episcopal Church and at present is used for Sunday school classes and office space.

But Family Promise is a nonprofit that wants to convert the house into a homeless shelter for displaced families.

More than 30 years ago people of different faiths from Hunterdon County churches formed a group to provide temporary housing for homeless folks and they’ve been doing that at a facility in surrounding Raritan Township. Now they want a land use variance in order to use the building on New York Avenue in the middle of a quiet residential neighborhood to house more people.

Some neighbors aren’t having it. Signs reading STOP THE SHELTER have gone up on lawns. People are nervous and angry. The meeting Tuesday night was expected to be so heavily attended they were holding it not at the borough hall but on Stangl Road at a place normally serving as a farmer’s market.

Family Promise says its “proposed supervised transitional housing for children and families experiencing homelessness satisfies a desperate need of the County of Hunterdon.”

They’re not wrong. According to MyCentralJersey.com they are the only homeless shelter serving the entire county. Which happens to be one of the richest counties in the country but that doesn’t mean there aren’t unfortunate souls who fall on bleak times. What are they to do?

Yet I also understand the fear of those fighting against it. I’m sure they’re greatly concerned about their property values. It’s likely they’re worried about potential problems being caused by homeless people in the place they raise their kids.

Family Promise says the stories of those who needed their services are heartbreaking. On their website they share this video of some of them telling their tales.

I understand the neighbors complaining about the project are just looking out for their own families. But isn’t there something to be said for society looking out for each other too? How do you turn your back on people facing this?

Hard questions with no easy answers. And answers will have to wait more weeks. At the last minute Tuesday night a postponement was called until Sept. 13 due to the attorney for Family Promise falling ill according to former Flemington councilman Joey Novick.

The stop the shelter signs will stay up until then and people facing desperate nights will no doubt have more of them.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended a voluntary recall of the food but Darwin's declined. In a statement the company said its food is safe and the FDA requesting that Darwin's warn its customers was ""wholly unnecessary.""

On Friday the FDA announced samples of Darwin's Natural Selections Antibiotic & Grain Free Chicken Recipe for Cats and Natural Selections Antibiotic & Grain Free Turkey Recipe for Cats had tested positive for salmonella representing ""a serious threat to human and animal health.""

The FDA advised cat owners in possession of the food to throw it away and disinfect any surfaces or containers—or hands—the food has touched. The warning only addresses two lots of food and you can see if yours is affected by checking the information on the packaging.

According to the FDA three kittens in the same house—more on that below—ate the food and developed diarrhea. Investigators tested the food and genome sequencing revealed salmonella bacteria in both kinds of food.

Salmonella poisoning can make both us and our cats sick. Our feline friends can experience vomiting diarrhea fever and loss of appetite. If your cat has consumed any of the potentially tainted food it's a good idea to call your veterinarian.

Darwin's: 'There Are No Pet Health Risks To Address'

In its response to the FDA Darwin's Natural Pet Products contended that its food is safe and argued that salmonella poisoning wasn't the reason the kittens became ill.

The company wrote that the three kittens ate the raw food out of an adult cat's food bowl. Darwin's warns customers not to feed their kittens raw food because it can upset their newly functioning digestive symptoms.

""The kittens did not experience any other health issues and did not require further veterinary care"" the company wrote. ""The adult cat never developed any adverse effects.""

Darwin's then took issue with the FDA's testing saying regulators only found ""trace"" amounts of salmonella. Additional independent testing found no salmonella. That suggested to Darwin's that the amount of salmonella in the chicken and turkey foods was so low ""that it would not pose a risk to pets.""

The company said it has received no additional complaints from customers about the food in question—probably because it's already been consumed. Darwin's sells its food online directly to customers.

""Overall there is no action needed by our customers and the Darwin's community other than to remember that all raw food requires safe handling practices"" the company wrote.

Should I Feed My Pet Raw Food?

Ask your veterinarian. They know you and your pet better than some guy on the internet.

Raw food proponents say the uncooked morsels—many times organ and muscle meat—resemble what cats' and dogs' wild ancestors ate. They argue it's ""real food"" free of preservatives synthetic additives and antibiotics. Some customers will anecdotally report pets showing more energy healthier coats and eased allergies after consuming the food.

However plenty of people urge pet owners to reconsider feeding their animals raw food including the American Veterinary Medical Association and the American Animal Hospital Association. They warn that raw food can transmit harmful parasites and cause illnesses like liver or kidney disease.

Again if you're considering raw food for your pet talk with your vet about it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vc2VudGllbnRtZWRpYS5vcmcvYmVoaW5kLWNsb3NlZC1kb29ycy1nb2F0LWRhaXJ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's What Happens Behind Closed Doors at an Intensive Goat Dairy,"A new undercover investigation by nonprofit campaign group Animal Justice Project (AJP) has revealed the “violent killing” of baby goats at Pasture House Farm in North Yorkshire England. Secret footage captured inside the intensive dairy — which holds more than 2000 goats and churns out over a million liters of milk each year — also appears to show goats being slapped shoved grabbed and shouted at.

Warning: This story contains images and video that may be disturbing

The farm’s owner Phil Ormerod who is also the director of the Milking Goat Association did not respond to our request for comment. However the BBC reports that he “strongly denied” claims that his animals were mistreated.

Pasture House Farm supplies award-winning dairy brand Delamere Dairy which sells goat milk butter cheese and yogurt to major supermarkets including Tesco Asda Sainsbury’s and Morrisons. Delamere dairy farms in the U.K. reportedly account for around one-third of the country’s goat milk production. According to its website the company also operates in the U.S. Australia China Malaysia and Thailand.

Delamere Dairy said in a statement: “From the evidence presented to us we do not believe there have been any breaches in animal welfare or legalities at the farm in question which is also the view from a number of independent sources.” It added that Pasture House Farm “has recently passed its Red Tractor independent Goat Farm Assurance as well as passing all its unannounced independent veterinary inspections”.

In addition a spokesperson for Delamere Dairy said in an email that what appears to be rough handling and violence toward animals in the footage is actually a worker “tending to the health and welfare of the kids.” The worker pushing the young goats away while she tries to carry out her tasks “is no different to someone pushing away their pet dog that was getting in the way and being bothersome” the spokesperson said.

Goat’s Milk No More Ethical Than Cow’s Milk

Goat dairy is a popular choice among people who for whatever reason don’t consume cow’s milk. But AJP’s investigation shows that dairy goats face almost exactly the same plight as cows.

In free-living populations goat kids have been known to stay with their mothers for as long as eleven to twelve months. But at Pasture House Farm secret cameras filmed mother goats being taken away from their babies just hours after giving birth a practice common to all dairy farms. AJP says that following separation the goats showed signs of distress such as searching for their kids and crying out.

Females are usually raised for use in the milking herd. Estimates suggest that 25 to 50 percent of male goat kids born into the industry are culled.

The investigation is believed to be the first in the U.K. to film the killing of surplus baby goats. The video shows newborn goats as young as one and two days old being shot with a stun gun before having a metal rod inserted into their forehead to end their life. Other goats appear to be watching as this was carried out.

Distressing images show dead goats including both kids and adults dumped like waste in piles across the farm.

Zero-Grazing Systems

Goats have adapted to live in rugged mountainous areas where they would dig climb play and browse for food. In contrast goats at Pasture House Farm are held in large crowded sheds with no enrichment and no access to the outdoors.

Goat dairy consumers may not realize that zero-grazing systems are the norm in goat farms. In a survey of Milking Goat Association farmers in England and Wales which was published in 2019 just 17 percent of respondents said that their dairy goats are allowed to graze outdoors.

Delamere Dairy’s website claims that its suppliers keep the goats indoors for “the welfare of the goats not the convenience of the farmer.” Goats the company explains are not well-suited to the British climate and would be at risk of foot infections if they spent time on soggy ground.

A spokesperson for the company reiterated this and said that the goats are housed in “large airy but draft-free barns” where they are “free to roam around in familiar groups on dry straw bedding with a constant supply of food and water.”

These indoor goat farms are different from natural goat habitats. “Goats naturally live in complex social groups and the use of their horns plays a strong role in communication” says veterinarian Molly Vasanthakumar. “Zero-graze systems inherently deny goats access to elevation and spaces to hide the ability to selectively browse and the space to form dynamic groups.”

Adds Vasanthakumar these goats are also de-horned in painful procedures. “Farms like Pasture House necessitate disbudding [a painful procedure that involves burning off a young goat’s horn buds with a hot iron] subsequently denying them the use of their horns. Therefore it is impossible for farms like this to provide these highly inquisitive and intelligent animals a ‘life worth living’.”

“The accumulation of poor living conditions mental health concerns and denial of basic natural behaviors cancel out Delamere’s claim that goats need to be housed in zero-grazing systems” says Ayrton Cooper AJP’s Campaigns Manager. “Convenience and profit is what drives this industry.”

Rather than being an isolated case of abuse campaigners believe that Pasture House Farm is actually typical “representative of commercial goat farming in the U.K.” AJP’s new investigation suggests that the ethical issues associated with dairy farming aren’t limited to cows. “We urge people to make their choices count by opting for plant-based foods as the only ethical alternative to dairy” says Cooper.

This time the building at the site is being demolished.

Sandy Walden permit clerk and office manager at the Jefferson County Building and Code Enforcement Department said Thermo King in care of Trane Technologies had applied for a permit from the department for the demolition June 27.

""Arcadis US Inc. is the company tearing it down"" she said.

Ingersoll Rand the parent company to Thermo King in Louisville said in 2011 it would close the plant by the second quarter 2012. It employed 235 people.

Louisville City Administrator Ricky Sapp said city services water sewer and gas to the site were disconnected sometime around April or May.

Sara Lips Director of Communications and Community Engagement with Georgia EPD said the site had been placed on the EPD's Hazardous Site Inventory on July 19 2001 and delisted Sept. 17 2019.

""It was listed for volatile organic compounds in both soil and groundwater"" she said. ""The property was cleaned up to Type 5 standards.""

The site currently has both institutional and engineering controls implemented to prevent unacceptable risk to sensitive receptors both human and environmental.

""A Uniform Environmental Covenant (UIC) has been recorded with the deed to 1) restrict land and groundwater usage and to 2) require routine Operation and Maintenance of engineering controls used to prevent human and environmental receptors from unacceptable exposure to regulated substances primarily chlorinated solvents that remain in limited areas of soil and groundwater"" she explained.

""Soil and groundwater are currently in compliance with Type 5 risk reduction standards (RRS) where certain areas of soil and groundwater do not meet residential (Type 1 or 2) or non-residential (Type 3 or 4) RRS. Both the institutional (UEC) and engineering controls are to remain in place until such time as soil and groundwater are demonstrated to be in compliance with residential RRS.""

The property may be sold however the purchaser must comply with the restrictions stated in the recorded UEC and operate and maintain engineering controls until both soil and groundwater are deemed to be suitable for residential use.

Lips said the site is inspected on a routine basis and engineering controls are repaired as needed.

""EPD is to be notified of any major repairs needed (such as breaches of the controls) upon discovery; otherwise the current owner of the site property submits land and groundwater use certifications and an O&M report annually to EPD"" she said.

Former President Trump pleads the fifth during his deposition for NY AG Letitia James’s investigation Japan’s PM replaces his female birthrates minister with a male bank executive and Away CEO Jen Rubio moves the travel brand beyond its weekend-trip roots.

– Away we go. With borders open this summer travelers are eager to make a triumphant return to their European vacations (nevermind the flight cancellations and lost luggage). But others have stuck by pandemic-era travel trends like the local road trip or outdoor adventures.

Whichever type of trip travelers choose Away is positioning itself to address vacationers’ needs. The company now synonymous with its hardshell suitcases debuted a new line of duffle bags and backpacks this summer geared toward outdoor adventuring. The launch represented a long-planned pivot from the carry-on suitcases that became ubiquitous among city travelers.

“We’d always made a large variety of travel goods but if you looked at our portfolio we were really only serving the city trips and weekend getaways” says CEO Jen Rubio. “As consumer behavior changed through the pandemic and people were taking more outdoorsy adventurous trips we realized we weren’t serving that need.”

The company was valued at over $1 billion with more than $150 million in funding before the pandemic. In 2020 cofounder and CEO Steph Korey stepped down following allegations of a toxic work environment. Rubio also a cofounder but with a focus on branding and marketing took over as CEO a year later. The company conducted layoffs during the pandemic and now has a headcount of about 250.

Rubio and I spoke over Zoom last week shortly after she’d returned from a trip to Italy. (“Just like everyone else this summer” she joked.) While Rubio is among the cohort to choose trans-Atlantic travel this summer she wants to serve a wider array of customers.

Away began work on its new outdoors line F.A.R. 18 months before its June debut. Part of the challenge for consumer businesses in this stage of the pandemic has been figuring out which trends are temporary and which are here to stay. Away is betting that the increase in outdoor travel is a permanent consumer shift. The company says that since the launch of the F.A.R. line it has seen customers’ lifetime value increase “significantly” from a previous customer average two or three purchases. Its suitcases start at $275 and sell for as much as $745 while its new outdoor bags start at $150. Rubio expects these outdoor travel products to eventually make up one-fourth of the company’s business.

While outdoor travel has increased in popularity since 2020 it remains an intimidating prospect for some. “I was one of those people who was intimidated to go into an REI” Rubio recalls of her pandemic move to Colorado. The F.A.R. line is meant to be approachable she says with its bright colors and activity-based advertising for the hardcore trekker and new hiker alike. The line also has a higher share of male customers than Away’s core offerings do.

F.A.R.’s launch is Away’s first foray into a significant new category—but not its last. Rubio envisions the company developing new products to serve luxury travelers and participants in wellness retreats. “It’s really exciting to branch out” she says.

ALSO IN THE HEADLINES

- Pleading the fifth. Former President Donald Trump arrived in New York on Wednesday for his long-awaited deposition. The deposition is part of a civil investigation by New York Attorney General Letitia James into his business practices. Trump who once questioned why someone would invoke their fifth amendment rights if they were innocent invoked his fifth amendment rights and declined to answer questions from the AG. Two of his children Ivanka and Eric did answer the state’s questions in their own recent depositions. CNN

- WFH paradox. The flexibility women get working from home has paradoxically created more domestic and childrearing responsibilities. That's for a number of reasons: pressure from traditional gender roles means men are avoiding remote or hybrid roles that create flexibility and a lack of childcare infrastructure forces women to cut hours or leave the workforce. But the fight for gender equity has long focused on individual families and organizations rather than on a society that has long been hostile to working mothers. Instead corporations need to look beyond their own HR efforts and support legislation that reorients how we handle domestic care and labor. Bloomberg

- Last one standing. Liz Cheney is officially the last pro-impeachment Republican to face a pro-Trump primary contender. So far only two of six pro-impeachment Republicans have won their primary. Washington Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler officially conceded her defeat to Trump-backed Joe Kent on Tuesday. Cheney now faces an uphill battle to defeat attorney and former Republican National Committeewoman Harriet Hageman next Wednesday. Business Insider

- In her shoes. Japan’s prime minister replaced his female minister in charge of addressing the country’s falling birthrate with a male former bank executive. Masanobu Ogura who is married with no children replaced Seiko Noda a mother of one who recently blamed a male-dominated political spectrum for Japan’s “indifference and ignorance” on birthrates. Ogura and two other lawmakers have taken to wearing a 16-pound fake belly to understand the experience of carrying a child. Bloomberg

IN CASE YOU MISSED IT

- Delayed justice. A grand jury in Mississippi has declined to indict Carolyn Bryant Donham the white woman whose accusations led to the lynching of 14-year-old Emmett Till in 1955. Calls for her arrest were revived after an unserved arrest warrant for Donham was discovered in a courthouse basement and an unpublished memoir written by Donham was obtained by the Associated Press last month. Despite these revelations a grand jury said there was insufficient evidence to indict Donham on kidnapping and manslaughter charges. Guardian

- Intimacy coordinators. Several female actresses are speaking out about the necessity of intimacy coordinators (IC) after Game of Thrones star Sean Bean said their presence “spoils the spontaneity” of intimate scenes. Bean’s Snowpiercer costar Lena Hill West Side Story star Rachel Zegler and Amanda Seyfried all shared how the presence of an IC helped them speak up about scenes that made them uncomfortable. Variety

- Going green. Men have long dominated the energy sector but a network of nonprofits and tradeswomen groups are working to change that. The field is expected to grow rapidly over the next few years and experts believe women can particularly benefit from these “family sustaining jobs.” Some organizations are also piloting childcare programs and anti-harassment trainings for men to combat the industry’s infamous “bro culture.” 19th*

The properties she manages are all short-term rental units.

Before she was hopping from German row-homes to luxury apartments in the Queen City Henry spent years in the traditional hospitality business working in hotels for the likes of Marriot and Hilton. With the emergence of websites like Airbnb and Vrbo she saw a better way.

Now Henry works as the City Manager of Operations on a small team at Liberty Hill Rentals which operates short-term rental properties under the host name ""Chris & Chris"" on Airbnb. According to its website the company offers ""centrally located homes away from home for corporate and vacation travelers.""

Chris & Chris have 71 listings to their name in Cincinnati. Prices range from $50 to $3000 per night some of which include multi-family stays where the costs can be split up.

Chris & Chris started in 2015 in founder Chris Hikel's spare bedroom. He listed it on Airbnb to try and make some extra cash. By the time Liberty Hills Rentals was officially formed in 2019 Chris had 21 short-term rental properties across the Queen City. After bouncing back from a major dip in business due to COVID-19 the company now has more than 70 rental listings in at least 15 buildings in Over-The-Rhine Mount Adams Pendleton and Covington.

Photo by: Liberty Hill Rentals This property in Over-The-Rhine is listed at $3000 per night on Chris and Chris's Airbnb account. The three bedroom unit sleeps up to 10 guests.

Henry said the majority of Chris & Chris's listings are not owned by Liberty Hill Rentals.

""We actually manage for private owners"" Henry said ""We do the day-to-day communications the property upkeep we handle the housekeeping and everything from that end.""

Henry said Hikel owns around 25% of the listings. The other 75% they manage are owned by locals and people who live out of town. According to Henry some listings are single units within condo complexes while other listings are entire buildings with multiple rentals available for booking.

One of their buildings is right next to Rhinegeist Brewery with different themed suites named after Rhinegeist beer like the Bubbles Suite Swizzle Suite or the Cheetah Suite. Henry said the brewery will often refer guests of big events like weddings to stay in Airbnbs owned by Liberty Hill Rentals.

Photo by: Liberty Hill Rentals According to Liberty Hill Rentals this entire building is renovated and sleeps up to 16 guests in multiple units. It is located close to Rhinegeist Brewery in OTR. It is listed on Airbnb for $2271 per night.

Photo by: Liberty Hill Rentals Here's a look inside on of the units in a renovated OTR building that can cost up to $2271 per night.

""Rhinegeist obviously has that event space so we've had a lot of weddings come in a lot of wedding parties; they need a good amount of space. We've had family reunions in that building just different gatherings"" Henry said. ""Thanksgiving it... usually rents out for the entire building because people are looking for a place for their entire families to stay.""

Henry said the rentals are not limited to a week-by-week basis. She said that while they don't offer typical 12-month leases clients have rented for 3-to-6 months at a time. She said she's seen everyone from traveling nurses to filmmakers reaching out to the company because they need more than just a hotel room but won't be in town long enough to rent for a year.

""I think we are meeting a need"" Henry said. ""Our portfolio is so diverse that we can almost have something to accommodate everybody.""

Henry believes there will always be a need for the standard hotel but with the emergence of companies like Airbnb travelers have thousands more options of where they can stay and when.

Photo by: Liberty Hill Rentals Some properties include outdoor spaces for guests to utilize. This OTR listing costs up to $116 per night.

Right now their business is growing through word of mouth but Henry said after they reach their goal of 80 listings by 2023 they will start focusing more on reaching out to other Airbnb owners and asking if they could use their management services. Eventually the long-term goal is for the business to expand outside of Cincinnati.

Henry said all their listings can be found on Airbnb and the company's website. She said some listings are also now on Vrbo.

Short-term vs. long-term

Henry said property developers and property owners are shifting to a short-term rental plan instead of a traditional 12-month lease because it gives them a bigger return on their investment.

The short-term rental industry has been repeatedly accused of driving housing prices up by contributing to the housing shortage both in the U.S. and abroad. The accusations have been coming from city councils in popular travel destinations like Amsterdam London and New York City.

Charles Tassell the Chief Operating Officer for the National Real-Estate Investors Association said the real estate and the rental markets are ""hot"" but he doesn't typically see short-term rentals impacting the overall housing and renting market in Cincinnati.

""It especially doesn't affect lower income renters or even medium income renters"" Tassell said. ""These are high-end properties that are being turned into short-term rentals.""

Tassell said these properties that are being rented were never in the market price range for low-income or medium-income renters in the first place.

According to Apartments.com most rentals in and around the same geographical area where Liberty Hill Rentals have the most listings start at more than $1000 a month for a studio apartment. The cheapest listing we found was a one-bedroom for $800 a month. Less than a mile away the most expensive listing we found was $4302 for a two-bedroom.

Overall there are still more long-term rentals available in the greater Cincinnati region than short-term rentals. According to Airbnb there are more than 1000 stays available in the greater Cincinnati region. Apartments.com shows at least 2780 listings in the greater Cincinnati region.

The booming short-term rental market is not just a Cincinnati phenomenon. HomeAdvisor a company that partners with Angi recently released a report that highlights which U.S. cities are best and worst for rental investors. While The Queen City doesn't make the list there is a trend that backs up what Henry said Liberty Hill is experiencing: It is more lucrative for investors to buy and operate Airbnb properties in cities that are not considered destination hot spots. Investors get a much better return if operating an Airbnb in Cincinnati than in San Francisco or New York City.

New York City one of the U.S. cities with the most Airbnbs reportedly now has more short-term locations than actual apartments to rent.

The New York City’s Comptroller’s Office published a reportarguing the increase in Airbnbs cost New Yorkers a total of $616 million in additional rent in 2016 as a result of price pressures. Airbnb responded by criticizing the methodology saying it “severely misrepresents the impact of [the] platform on housing.”

Although preliminary research suggests Airbnb short-term rentals do have some kind of impact on housing prices there’s still a lot of debate over how big of a rise it actually is.

What Liberty Hill Rentals (AKA Chris and Chris) is doing is a smaller version of a trend that's happening across the nation and the world.

Tassell said out of 143 million households across the country less than 700000 are short-term rentals and it's not big corporations that are buying all of them up.

""About 10% of homes that have been purchased for rentals are being bought up by large corporations. The majority of it is mom and pop; it's local neighbors reinvesting in their neighborhood. That's 90% of it"" Tassell said.

Despite a recent rental report from Redfin that showed rent increasing 32% in one year Tassell said the Cincinnati area is still one of the most economical regions to rent.

Tassell blames the more pricey rental market on the lack of new building projects.

""There's been some building but with interest rates climbing builders get nervous so they slow down"" Tassell said.

According to Tassell many building companies are extremely conservative because of the 2008 housing crisis.

""The companies that survived 2008 have those scars so they're hesitant to overbuild"" Tassell said.

""I'm not in the business of giving interest-free loans to billion-dollar companies"" says Johnson who booked a flight from his hometown of Syracuse New York to Richmond Virginia.

In late July D.J. Johnson received a $352 refund for a canceled flight — after nearly two months of texts and calls to Delta Air Lines. Johnson isn't happy with how long the refund process dragged on.

Delta's policy is to ""make every effort"" to process refunds within seven days. In its messaging to customers the company cautions that due to ""high volume"" refunds can take up to 30 days plus another two billing cycles for tickets purchased with a credit or debit card. Delta did not immediately respond to CNBC Make It's request for comment.

Johnson is one of many consumers waiting weeks for their refunds this summer. That may be because of the large number of flight cancellations and delays as the airline industry has struggled to keep up with the post-pandemic demand for travel. On average 1 in 5 flights arrived behind schedule as of July 2022.

While Johnson accepts that delays and cancellations come with air travel he doesn't understand why a refund should take weeks to process: ""There's one button that somebody has to click to process a refund; it's just them dragging it out as long as legally they're allowed to.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsZ2VvZ3JhcGhpYy5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvaGVyZXMtaG93LXRvLWhpcmUtbG9jYWxzLXRvLXNob3cteW91LXRoZWlyLXRvd25z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Locals can be excellent tour guides.

How ‘citizen guides’ can bring insight and intrigue to your next journey

Locals can be excellent tour guides. Here’s how to hire one

A few years ago Ruth Sadur and her boyfriend were supposed to travel together to Bali Indonesia. When he had to cancel at the last minute Sadur wanted help navigating the trip. Her hotel connected her with De Yudha Herdyana a local guide who thought her itinerary was too generic. Instead he ferried her to tourist-free rice paddies uncrowded beaches and restaurants with menus in Balinese that he translated.



“It was one of my best travel days” says the Melbourne Australia childcare worker. “He felt like my friend by the end of it.”

Herdyana is a citizen guide a savvy resident whose small group tours can give travelers a fresh often inexpensive introduction to a new place. Tourists have long connected with private guides but internet-driven companies such as ToursByLocals and Airbnb Experiences are introducing younger travelers to more personalized locally connected experiences by creating platforms where citizen guides can offer their services.

(Delve into the Indigenous women upending Canada’s tourism industry.)



Some experiences are unconventional to say the least: A kayak trip down the Nile to see Cairo Egypt; a hike with a herd of goats in Death Valley California. Some tours are more conventional of course. You can always see Pompeii Italy with an archaeologist or Washington D.C.’s Georgetown with a historian.

“But these guides can take you to more places in less time than when you are alone with your Lonely Planet book and a brochure from the tourist information office” says Núria Galí Espelt who studies tourism as an art history professor at the University of Girona.

Here’s why citizen guides have become more common what kind of experiences and insider information they offer and how to hire one during your next trip.

A personalized approach to tours

As tourism became a major economic driver in the 20th and 21st centuries mass options were created to cater to crowds. Flat bottom boats (bateaux mouches) with prerecorded spiels launched in Paris in the mid 20th-century; hop-on hop-off tour buses cruised the streets nearly everywhere by the 1980s; and jumbo cruise ship excursions now herd hordes around historic sites from Venice to Mexico. Somewhere along the way guided tours earned a rep for being stodgy sites-by-the-numbers itineraries.

Private guides had long been available to the wealthy or connected. But as travel information moved increasingly online in the early 21st century suddenly anyone could turn up details on foodie walks around Porto Portugal or Google Shop Hop BA which leads one-on-one visits to the crafts ateliers and vintage shops of Buenos Aires Argentina. Multiple surveys find that people especially Millennials and Generation Zers enjoy paying for experiences more than spending money on material items.

(Read about the pioneering tour guides showing Afghanistan to the world.)



These specialty tours or private guides can have deeper connections and knowledge about the places where they operate resulting in more bespoke trips for small groups or single travelers.



“Guides bring the spirit of the destination to life in a unique way” says Nikki Hellyer of ToursbyLocals. “In some cases they’ve got generations of family there plus unique stories and access to different things.”

A guide can act as a hired friend-for-a-day helping you see a place better and doling out mundane-but-useful information—how to navigate the New York City subway where to buy groceries in Berlin.



The experience often transcends a simple work-for-hire arrangement: The artist who shows you the many street murals of Lima Peru might invite you to a gallery opening after your tour; that bike trip leader in Copenhagen can fill you in on the city’s cycle lane rules and tell you where to grab a post-ride beer.

How to get your guide

The old-school way to find a local guide is to ask your hotel and it’s still valid. But you can also search for guides and experiences via ToursbyLocals; the pay-what-you-want Free Tours by Foot; or Airbnb Experiences which launched in 2016 as a companion to the lodging listings company. The last offers some 40000 options in 1000 cities ranging from walking tours of downtown Sydney Australia to surfing lessons in Los Angeles to exploring an abandoned missile silo in Kansas.

Citizens-on-the-street also headline with walking tour companies in major cities including the long-running English-guided Paris Walks and Washington D.C.’s history-focused Washington Walks.



If you have very specific interests (pottery in Spain Shakespeare in London) check with your destination’s official visitors bureau. Or try a Google search using your interest destination and the word “tour” to turn up specialized experiences such as Tokyo Ramen Tours or New York City Jewish history tours.



Just because a tour is private does not mean it costs more. Prices vary from place to place but especially for family or friends traveling together a private trip can be cheaper than joining a big bus or giant group walking tour.

What it takes to be a guide

In some countries or cities tour guides must receive special training and get certified; in other places and cases guides are professional historians passionate foodies or just residents who are deeply plugged into their hometowns.

What makes a standout one is their ability to interact with strangers and impart their knowledge in memorable ways. Deirdre Harman a ToursByLocals guide in Dingle Ireland sometimes sings or speaks in Gaelic when showing people churches and other spiritual sites. “You can read all about a place but good guides can grow peoples’ imaginations” she says. “We draw them into the experience.”



(Discover your next great vacation via TikTok.)



For travelers a guide can be both make a trip more meaningful and reveal what it’s really like to live in a given place. Take Jorteh Senah a New York-based tech worker who visited Cairo Egypt recently. Short on time he hired an Airbnb Experiences guide Bakr Ghoniem.

Ghoniem picked him up from the airport and whisked him to see—and photograph—the pyramids and the Sphinx far from the crowds. “Bakr was very social media savvy” says Senah. “He knew how to capture the angles.”



Over tea Ghoniem told Senah about what his life was like in Cairo beyond the ancient monuments and souvenir hawkers. “It turned into a real conversation” says Senah. “It was a cultural experience on so many levels.”

Nerdun Hacıoğlu- MOSCOW

After the western nations closed their air space to Russia amid the invasion of Ukraine Türkiye has become the main gateway for Russian travelers and now Moscow wants more flights between the two countries.

Turkish airline companies mainly the flag carrier THY currently have 85 flights a day between Türkiye and Russia. Russia now demands that the number of daily flights increase to 100 at the end of August.

There are two groups of Russian travelers flying to Türkiye: Tourists and transit passengers.

Holidaymakers go to the popular Turkish resorts such as Antalya on the Mediterranean coast and the district of Bodrum in the western province of Muğla.

Some Russians meanwhile use Türkiye as a transit route to travel to third countries. The latter group of travelers mostly fly to Istanbul Airport to take another flight on the same day of arrival for another foreign destination.

The sanctions have not only changed the way Russians travel but also affected the cost of travel.

A plane ticket from St. Petersburg to Istanbul costs as much as the ticket for an Istanbul-New York flight.

Those who have stopover flights rent apartments in Istanbul to avoid higher travel costs. Those Russians chose to stay in the city for a couple of days before departing for their final destinations.

For instance a same day flight from Moscow to Rome via Istanbul costs some $1300 but if they spend one or two days in Istanbul they save up to $200 or $300.

Russian transit passengers include people who vacation in Europe and those fleeing their countries; they buy a one-way ticket.

Between March and early July Russians had problems buying tickets for Turkish Airline flights since they could not use their credit cards and Türkiye’s flag carrier could not process transactions made with Russia’s MIR card. Russians had to make the payments in cash.

But this problem was resolved at the start of July and Russians are now able to buy tickets to Turkish destinations but also to destinations in third countries.

The United Arab Emirates Serbia Egypt Armenia Kazakhstan Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan also offer a gateway for Russians. But only 15 percent of Russians use those routes while 85 percent travel to other countries via Türkiye.

Vnukovo Airport in Moscow is always packed with passengers around the clock traveling to Türkiye. The busiest hours at the airport are between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. and 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. Sometimes planes depart for Türkiye every five minutes."

SUNNYVALE Calif. Aug. 11 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Trimble (NASDAQ: TRMB) introduced today data integrity monitoring for its precise point positioning (PPP) correction service CenterPoint® RTX Fast. The Trimble RTX Integrity™ monitoring system is an innovative patented solution built in direct response to client requirements for production-ready applications. It continuously validates the reliability of correction data processed by the network which is broadcast to users in the agriculture geospatial construction and automotive industries ensuring positioning data is right the first time.

Trimble RTX Integrity Validates Positioning Data Accuracy to Support Safety-Critical Applications

Through a unique two-step process the Trimble RTX Integrity system verifies the integrity of GNSS data received from satellites and filters faulty information in the network server before the data is broadcast. A secondary post-broadcast check is conducted on the entire data transmission process where additional errors may be detected and removed. The integrity monitoring system is fully automated and reacts in seconds to detect isolate and block faulty data to provide even more highly accurate and reliable positioning.

Trimble RTX Integrity is comprised of independent monitoring stations strategically positioned across RTX Fast networks in the United States southern Canada and across Europe. These stations continuously monitor data output during multiple stages of the Trimble RTX positioning process. Any suspicious satellite data is removed during the integrity protection process and positioning is calculated using only validated data.

Trimble Alloy™ GNSS reference receivers power the independent monitoring stations using redundant internet connectivity for added reliability. To date no other positioning network offers the same level of data integrity validation across such expansive contiguous geographies.

Trimble RTX Integrity monitoring system was developed in accordance with Automotive Software Performance Improvement and Capability dEtermination (ASPICE) and ISO 26262 automotive safety standards making it easy to integrate into major automotive manufacturers' autonomous driving systems. Trimble RTX Integrity can also be used by Trimble's customers in the agriculture geospatial and construction industries to ensure correction stream integrity and reliability for applications such as machine control and high-accuracy surveying applications.

""Trimble remains committed to exceeding expectations by providing accurate corrections to our customers to support safety-critical and other day-to-day applications"" said Patricia Boothe SVP of autonomy Trimble. ""Implementing additional checks and balances to ensure our data is authenticated trustworthy and accurate is of paramount importance to maintaining the integrity of our RTX network and instilling confidence with our users that the data is correct.""

For example Trucker Path has used geofencing to amass about 20000 parking locations where drivers can park their trucks safely and legally by gathering data on space availability from users when they cross that digitally drawn fence around a specific geographic area. It also asks drivers about wait time at shipping facilities so drivers have an understanding or expectation based on people who were there before them and can plan accordingly.

“It really helps to drive efficiencies because it gives you a look forward as a driver which then rolls up to the fleets” said Chris Oliver chief marketing officer at Trucker Path.

Those efficiencies are important in a time of resource scarcity and higher prices. Trimble Maps recently introduced updated geofencing technology to add precision in pinpointing commercial locations like warehouses to improve efficiency.

Trimble began working on its polygonal Places Data in 2019 launching initially as a small library of locations. The company has since identified a larger number of locations and higher volume of data and released an expanded version this year.

Geofences have traditionally served as simple wide-radius circles around an address triggering automated arrival notifications and driver alerts a mile or so away from a driver’s actual destination. Trimble’s enhanced Places Data added more accurate useful data points to millions of commercial locations across the U.S. such as which service road or entrance a driver should use reducing delays due to incorrect directions and risky driving behaviors caused by stress and confusion.

“Typical mapping systems in the industry offer customers a radius around the stop location to raise alerts; these incorrect alerts then have to be verified by back-office personnel and also require driver interaction in some cases before communicating to the shipper” said Rishi Mehra director of operations and strategy at Trimble Maps. “The lack of reliability of these notifications make it impossible for fleets to calculate true dwell and detention times for facilities.”

Mehra said Trimble used a combination of manual research machine learning and partner verification to build out the accurate polygon geofences which cover the actual facility and the drive area (including parking spots) within each facility. Trimble Maps has coded the internal road network for a lot of these locations as well.

Compared to a simple wide-radius circle he said these polygons offer precise entry and exit notifications eliminating false positives from circular fences when a driver is still far out from the facility or even doing a drive-by without actually entering the facility. Trimble Maps also offers the capability of having sub-geofences within the master polygon to allow for precise location awareness within large yards. These features assist in route planning and navigation.

“The precise location information helps carriers ensure that drivers are navigated to the correct location and proper entrance to the facility” Mehra said. “The drivers have the confidence to not have to worry about last-mile navigation challenges and instead can focus on actual driving and delivery. This can help eliminate a lot of the accidents we see due to incorrect location data.”

Logistics company NFI (CCJ Top 250 No. 21) has received a lot of positive feedback from its drivers about the addition of notes and paths to enter a facility said Alexa Branco senior operations support manager at NFI.

Once a driver enters a facility these precise polygon geofences are used to generate auto-arrive and depart notifications and dwell and detention time calculations among additional services allowing carriers to more accurately calculate actual mileage and cost helping improve their bottom lines – a highly sought-after feature with elevated diesel prices. Mehra said the use of the average dwell time can also be helpful when bidding for future contracts.

“This capability enables fleets to make the full delivery on time the first time. Using the Maps platform fleets can also provide drivers with specific comments related to each facility making their delivery process even smoother” he said. “All of this can help eliminate the wasted time at and around facilities getting drivers back on the road faster which partially helps address the driver shortage problem. As drivers are able to get in and out of facilities faster they can utilize more of their available drive time based on hours of service regulations.”

The data geofencing can provide is useful outside of finding parking quickly saving on fuel route planning and calculating dwell time among other things.

For example a Midwest customer of route optimization platform Route4Me uses geofencing to alert drivers when they enter a high crime area to make them aware that they need to pay extra attention to their load. Customers can also draw on the map to create “avoidance zones” so drivers are routed around that area.

Oliver said the technology can even be used to draw a line in front of a steep downgrade so fleet managers can see if their drivers are going too fast down the hill.

He said geofencing provides many opportunities to create efficiencies and the technology continues to evolve.",,,,,,,,,

The band played a set loaded with classic hits following an opening set from indie rock icons The Strokes.

The Strokes got the night started walking out to Kraftwerk‘s “Kometenmelodie 2”. They played a mix of songs from their early 2000’s heyday like “Reptilia” off of 2003’s Room on Fire and selections from their most recent album The New Abnormal including “Bad Decisions” and “The Adults Are Talking”. Many of the songs on the setlist were culled from 2001’s Is This It among them “Hard to Explain” “New York City Cops” “Take It or Leave It” and the set-closing “Someday”.

After The Strokes’ opening set Red Hot Chili Peppers busted onto the stage and launched into an intro jam that ultimately gave way to a funky “Around the World”. Next came “Dani California” off 2006’s Stadium Arcadium and “Scar Tissue” from 1999’s Californiacation. The band then played the first song of the night from the recently released Unlimited Love “Aquatic Mouth Dance”. “These Are The Ways” “The Heavy Wing” and “Black Summer” were also pulled from the band’s most recent album. The Chili Peppers didn’t shy away from the older stuff though. “Suck My Kiss” and “Give It Away” from 1991’s Blood Sugar Sex Magic and “Nobody Weird Like Me” from 1989’s Mother’s Milk all appeared in the main set along with other fan-favorites like “Snow (Hey Oh)” “Tell Me Baby” and “Californication”.

For the encore the Chili Peppers came out swinging with “Sir Psycho Sexy” which they followed up with a cover of Robert Johnson‘s “They’re Red Hot”. They then closed out the night with “By the Way”.

- - -

Addison Moore (Versailles KY) entered the AAU Junior Olympic Games as an up-and-coming athlete to watch chasing after distance titles as a heavy favorite in the 14-year-old division.

She didn't wait long to make her presence known at North Carolina A&T's Truist Stadium. A win in the 1500m early in the week and a fourth-place finish in the 800m allowed Moore to put her distance talent on full display.

But come the 3000m final on the last day of competition at the Junior Olympics Moore took to the track ready to run something special.

The rising high school freshman had never gone below 10 minutes before at the 3000m distance. But Moore pushed the pace from the gun en route to shattering her personal best of 10:21.62.

She raced through the line in 9:57.45 to grab her second title of the event and end her rather impressive Junior Olympics showing. Moore's time even made for an AAU all-time best solidly surpassed London Culbreath's previous record of 10:02.40 from 2016 to become the first girl in the 14-year-old division to dip below 10 minutes.

Now Moore returns home to Kentucky as a new AAU national record holder and a distance talent to watch come high school.

Springdale Ark. announced on Nov. 3 a partnership agreement to invest in expanding the poultry capacity of Supreme Foods Processing Co. (SFPC) a subsidiary of Tanmiah to facilitate the company to increase its capacity of chicken production by 100000 tonnes per year and its daily processing capacity to over 1 million birds as part of a deal that was signed in July 2022.

Tanmiah officials said the deal will provide the company with the opportunity to expand its distribution by utilizing Tyson’s established technology and expertise in the global poultry processing sector. The partnership also included verbiage indicating the possibility of creating a global halal business.

SFPC produces value-added and cooked meats in three plants including two in Saudi Arabia and another in the United Arab Emirates. The company’s distribution extends to customers in the hospitality industry and quick-service restaurants located across the Middle East including Saudi Arabia Kuwait Bahrain UAE Oman Lebanon and Jordan.

“We are excited about this partnership that should help us expand our customer base in the Middle East” said TAN Sun president of Tyson Foods Asia Pacific. “The partnership enables Tanmiah and Tyson Foods to work towards a common goal of efficient and sustainable food production for the region and beyond.”

“We are delighted to be joining forces with a global leader in food production which will bolster our ambitious regional and global expansion plans” said Zulfiqar Hamadani chief executive officer of Tanmiah. “This collaboration is very significant for the poultry market in Saudi Arabia as it supports domestic self-sufficiency in line with Vision 2030 of the Kingdom.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndzd3Mub3JnL2VuL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjIvMDgvMTIvdHlzby1hMTIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Anger grows at Illinois Tyson food plant where 22-year-old worker was killed: “This stuff needs to change”,"Work in the meatpacking industry? We want to hear from you: Fill out the form at the end and tell us what conditions are like in your workplace. We will protect your anonymity.

Casen Garcia with his infant son [Photo: Allison Rose from Facebook]

On July 9 Casen Garcia a 22-year-old worker was killed on the job at the Tyson Foods plant in Joslin Illinois under as-yet unexplained circumstances.

In a family obituary posted last month Casen was described as an avid outdoorsman and lover of animals. “He enjoyed working with his hands music photography and drawing” it stated. “Some of his favorite times were those spent with family and friends. He will be greatly missed by all.”

Casen left behind his fiancée Jessica and their 14-month-old son as well as parents siblings grandparents and other family members.

The company has sought to evade responsibility for the death claiming it was the result of a “medical episode.” However reports continue to emerge of the lack of safety in the plant and in the area where Garcia was working.

A source at the Tyson Joslin plant recently contacted the WSWS wanting to expose the dangerous conditions and blatant disregard for workers’ safety. John whose name has been changed requested to remain anonymous fearing reprisals from Tyson.

“At the spot where Casen died at least six other workers had reported getting shocked by the hoist. So management knew there was an electrical safety issue and did nothing” John told the WSWS.

“This happens with all kinds of issues. In my department the machines that hook and carry the beef down the line are constantly jamming.” He continued “When that happens workers have to manually climb up and push the beef putting them in an awkward position where accidents are likely to happen.”

He described one incident where during a machine jam a large carcass fell from the hoist and landed right on a worker’s station. “Luckily he was on break and no one was there. If he hadn’t been he would have been seriously hurt.”

John went on to say that in just his department there have been at least eight “near-misses” where an accident nearly caused a serious injury or death. “All of them had been reported but nothing was ever done” he said.

“Often in the mornings management will call a meeting to discuss operations. They spend only a few seconds on safety you know: ‘Alright let’s talk about safety… everything good? Any near misses?… None? Okay good.’ And then they move on to production goals which is practically the entire meeting.”

“They always preach ‘safety first’ in the office but on the floor it’s production first.”

He said that Tyson has been heavily pushing speed-up and setting production goals that are impossible to reach. “Management only comes out onto the floor when we have to stop the line. That normally only happens when there is a safety issue and we have to stop to make sure no one will get hurt. So they come out demanding production continue and don’t even ask about the safety concern. Managers have been asleep in their offices when they are supposed to be checking that everything is safe and someone was disciplined for waking up a manager who was asleep on the job.”

According to John the pressure to keep production high despite a significant shortage of workers is fueling the safety issues. “They recently reported that we had 150 people either quit or be terminated. They are avoiding reporting any safety issues that normally would have resulted in a suspension because they are so short on labor. There were problems before but since the pandemic this has basically been how things are done.”

“Just yesterday there was a drain that backed up and the whole health services department was flooded. Even with the flooding going on they wanted production to continue” he said.

He explained that in the plant management promotions are awarded out through nepotism to the friends and relatives of the upper management. “Once there was a manager who had gotten so many write-ups that she was about to be suspended but because she was related to the plant manager they announced the next day that managers can’t be disciplined anymore.”

When asked specifically about Garcia’s death John told the WSWS that although he was not a witness and works in a different department he has witnessed similar conditions.

“I don’t doubt at all that the stories I have been hearing about his death are true. Especially about no one answering the ‘man down’ calls over the radio. I had something similar happen in my department. There was a worker who was having a medical emergency and health services were radioed but never answered. We kept asking that the radio chatter be kept clear because we were having an emergency but it was ignored and everyone kept talking over us. A worker had to run all the way to the health services office before they came to help.”

John said that any calls to address safety concerns are falling on deaf ears. “I don’t want to witness someone’s death and go to a funeral and tell the family ‘I’m sorry.’ We can fix these problems before anyone else is killed. I don’t want that to happen to me. I don’t want that to happen to a coworker.”

When asked if the United Food and Commercial Workers Union (UFCW) the union at the plant had responded to Garcia’s death he said “No the union has said nothing at all.” He added that the union rep in his department often ignores issues brought up by immigrant workers. In particular he noted that the union makes no attempt to address concerns of workers who do not speak English.

He concluded saying that there has been a lot of discontent among the workers since Garcia’s death and a fear that they too could be killed saying “This stuff needs to change.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXR0YWduZXQuY29tL2Jyb2lsZXJzLXR1cmtleXMvcHJvY2Vzc2luZy1zbGF1Z2h0ZXIvYXJ0aWNsZS8xNTUzNjI5MS93aHktdHlzb24tZW1icmFjZXMtYXV0b21hdGlvbi1pbi1wb3VsdHJ5LXByb2Nlc3NpbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Tyson embraces automation in poultry processing,"Advanced automation is helping Tyson Foods improve worker safety and efficiency in poultry processing.

The company recently completed a $90 million expansion to its poultry processing plant in Forest Mississippi. One of the biggest changes is the addition of automation technology to parts of its chicken processing line.

“Automation hits a lot of very key points” said Charlie Solomon Head of Poultry Operations Tyson Foods. “Historically automation had a really big performance gap to what a manual process was able to produce. Automation has come a really long way recently to where the performance is much better and some types of automation are very simple to upkeep.”

These benefits include:

Automation can simplify hard jobs

Already a struggle poultry processing facilities faced increased workforce challenges during the COVID-19 global pandemic. Automation could help solve labor shortages.

“It’s a great solution to simplify hard jobs and jobs that are physically taxing” Solomon said noting that Tyson Foods focuses its attention on automating jobs with high turnover rates.

The goal of automation is to augment not replace workers at poultry processing facilities. As a part of the expansion in Forest Tyson Foods plans to add 320 new jobs to the existing 1250 team members already employed.

Automation can make the work environment safer

Improving worker safety is another benefit of automation. Automated deboning machines use sensors to determine the size and dimensions of a carcass. Robots and other automated technologies remove or minimize the risk of human error and there’s also less worry about fatigue-related injuries.

“If you think about the manual deboning process – regardless of whether it’s the first half or the back half – anytime we use knives we have risks and exposures. A lot of the automation that we put into Forest helps us eliminate some of the difficult jobs with knives to create a safer work environment” he explained.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1enpmZWVkLmNvbS9yb3NzeW9kZXIvYmVzdC1mcm96ZW4tY2hpY2tlbi1udWdnZXRzLXN0b3JlLWJvdWdodNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best Frozen Chicken Nuggets We've Tried Ranked (2022),"In terms of the chicken itself I thought it was OK.

Net interest income noninterest income and pre-provision net revenue (net interest income plus noninterest income minus noninterest expense) across the industry were at all-time peaks according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data.

Profitability

U.S. commercial banks savings banks and savings and loan associations earned $93.16 billion of pre-provision net revenue in the quarter ended June 30 up 15.3% on a linked-quarter basis. In the previous nine quarters pre-provision net revenue had ranged from $75.30 billion to $82.36 billion.

Several large banks set a pre-provision net revenue record including Capital One Financial Corp. unit Capital One Bank (USA) NA Discover Financial Services unit Discover Bank and SVB Financial Group unit Silicon Valley Bank.

Higher provisions for credit losses partially offset the record-breaking revenue. The provision for the industry rose to $10.95 billion in the second quarter more than twice as high as in the first quarter. Only three of the 35 banks over $100 billion in total assets at June 30 recorded a negative provision: Bank of Montreal unit BMO Harris Bank NA PNC Financial Services Group Inc. unit PNC Bank NA and Northern Trust Corp. unit Northern Trust Co.

Balance sheet restructuring

U.S. banks and thrifts undertook significant balance sheet changes during the second quarter. Total loans and leases jumped 3.7% the highest quarterly increase since the first quarter of 2020. Total deposits declined 1.9% representing the first quarter-over-quarter decrease in four years. The loans-to-deposits ratio climbed more than 300 basis points to 60.17%.

While loans were up other assets such as cash and equivalents were down. Total assets were 1.1% lower which was the first quarterly decline in seven years. The two largest banks by total assets at June 30 — JPMorgan Chase & Co. unit JPMorgan Chase Bank NA and Bank of America Corp. unit Bank of America NA — shed close to 3% of their asset bases during the second quarter.

A greater emphasis on loans combined with higher interest rates to lift margins. The yield on loans and leases spiked 22 basis points helping push the fully taxable equivalent net interest margin to 2.74% from 2.51%. Margin expansion provided almost all of the 9.5% increase in net interest income which in turn drove the jump in pre-provision net revenue.

Rapid loan growth is not translating to noticeable credit deterioration. The early-stage delinquency ratio remained steady at 0.48% while the nonperforming asset ratio of 0.56% was slightly lower on a quarterly basis and down from 2.00% eight years ago. The net charge-off ratio inched up 1 basis point to 0.23% although it was down on a year-over-year basis.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdXRvZmluYW5jZW5ld3MubmV0L2FsbHBvc3RzL2F1dG8tZmluYW5jZS1leGNlbGxlbmNlL29wZXJhdGlvbnMtYWZlLzUtcXVlc3Rpb25zLXdpdGgtdS1zLWJhbmstdnAtb2YtZGVhbGVyLXNlcnZpY2VzLWtyaXN0aW5hLWJvbHRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 questions with… US Bank VP of Dealer Services Kristina Bolte,"Kristina Bolte vice president of dealer services for digital direct and alliance programs at U.S. Bank leans on her background in sales marketing and consumer experience to lead with compassion and inspire motivation.

Bolte has been at the bank since 2011 when she joined the student lending division as a user experience strategist. She then moved into the direct-to-consumer product space working as a project manager before taking on the role of an adherence manager building risk management programs. Bolte joined dealer services at U.S. bank in 2018 and took over the vice president role in 2020.

U.S. Bank has worked to expand its digital offerings during Bolte’s tenure. The bank earlier this month launched real-time payments for auto dealers to allow access to loan funds outside of normal business hours and to accelerate funding time. In May the bank launched a Spanish-speaking voice assistant to its mobile app for auto loan servicing and banking.

Bolte’s career started in sales for a TV news station in Cincinnati before working as a consultant at a digital marketing firm for small companies.

“I am 100% an accidental banker and I love every part of it” Bolte told Auto Finance News.

Auto Finance Excellence spoke with Bolte about her career and the current state of the banking industry. What follows is an edited version of the conversation.

Auto Finance Excellence: What are U.S. bank’s goals in about 10 words or less?

Kristina Bolte: Adding value for our customers and making investments to ensure long-term success.

AFE: What is your favorite piece of leadership advice ever received?

KB: When one candle lights another its light is not diminished. As a leader it is our responsibility to help motivate and support those around us. If we are always working to build each other and our teams up in a positive way we will only be more successful together.

AFE: Who has had the biggest influence on your career?

KB: I have been fortunate to work for some really fantastic leaders in my career especially since coming to U.S. Bank and joining dealer services. Each of those leaders has had a strong impact on my career in many different and wonderful ways. However the people that have had the biggest influence on my career overall would be my parents.

My dad was raised on a tobacco farm in a small town in Kentucky and was the first of his family to put himself through college. He studied math and computer science in a decade where that was not common and was able to build and cultivate a long successful career in the technical and business industry over the span of many decades. He taught my three sisters and I the value of working hard to achieve our goals.

My mother who was an occupational therapist taught us the value of compassion and helping others. I have tried to keep those values front and center in every role I have had and I believe they have been a cornerstone in any of my previous successes throughout my career

AFE: What do you think is the most underrated lending trend?

KB: Maintaining relevancy and value with your customers outside of — or in front of — the standard sales cycle.

AFE: What’s something your employees would be surprised to learn about you?

KB: While I love thrill rides like rollercoasters and controlled heights like bungee jumping I have a strong fear of open heights such as standing on ladders or hiking at higher elevations.

It’s Electric’s largest facility to date as demand for content continues strong Devlin said. “With the advent and continuation of the streaming industry’s growth we have been lucky to continue to do what we do best — create original scripted programs that audiences love.

Electric is currently wrapping production on its second season of Leverage: Redemption the spin-off of Leverage and one of Amazon Freevee’s first original programs. Almost Paradise which originally aired on WGNA has been green lit for a second season for Freevee and is currently in production.

And we all know there’s nothing like getting your favorites delivered to your doorstep – perhaps your Monday routine wouldn’t be the same without mac & cheese or you saved the party with a clutch champagne delivery or a courier helped you surprise your bestie with birthday cupcakes from 3000 miles away.

At Uber we know that this magic only exists because of drivers and couriers. That’s why we’re taking a moment to celebrate them. As many of us head back to school we’re releasing the first ever Uber Yearbook highlighting some of the most wonderful and inspiring folks on our platform.

You can see this year’s Uber Yearbook below featuring the Class of 2022. No matter where in the world you are we hope you get to meet some of the millions of drivers and couriers making Uber what it is.

We aim to celebrate drivers and delivery people everyday and at every turn. That’s why we’ve spent the last few years refocusing our efforts to innovate for them. With our goal to make Uber the best platform for flexible work in the world we’ve just announced some key new features that are a direct result of understanding and investing in their experience.

When you have a driver or courier who goes above and beyond make sure to rate them and give them a compliment after the trip – it goes a long way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFuZGxlaXN1cmUuY29tL3RyYXZlbC1uZXdzL3ViZXItZHJpdmVyLXllYXJib29r0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet the Coolest Uber Drivers in U.S.,"Uber is recognizing its drivers in a new way that goes way beyond ratings this year by celebrating its stand-out workers behind the wheel with superlatives in the company's very own yearbook.

The first of its kind the 2022 Uber Yearbook features 15 drivers from across the United States each with their own individual and cool description of what they're affectionately known for in their area the company shared with Travel + Leisure.

""We know that the Uber magic only exists because of our drivers and couriers and we are committed to supporting and celebrating them at every turn"" Carrol Chang the global head of driver and courier operations at Uber told T+L. ""With our first-ever Uber Yearbook we're taking a moment to highlight some of the most inspiring people in the Uber community.""

Like Driver Justin Layton who has the ""coolest car"" in Sin City with his Ferrari 458 Spider and Tanaye White who has the ""coolest side hustle"" after she turned from courier into Sports Illustrated swimsuit model. Uber riders in Birmingham Ala. will know all about Charlana Moses who has the most trips with more than 60000 Uber rides and is lovingly known as 'Mama C' to students there.

Driver Bruce Smith is known as the Uber driver with the longest trip when he took two customers two cats and eight suitcases 1377 miles non-stop from New York to Florida — and at a cost of $3000. Tammy Rivera is known as the ""good samaritan driver"" for her work in Memphis bringing meals from local restaurants to COVID-19 hospital workers for nearly 300 nights in a row. And don't forget about Barbra Watkins who is ""young at heart"" while working as a driver at 78 years old in San Jose Calif. (when she's not riding her horse Tycoon in her spare time of course).

When it comes to food deliveries Debbie Baker in Miami takes the cake with the most Champagne deliveries (her favorite drink is a bay breeze) but Azubuike Onwumere wins the title for ""most deliveries"" overall in Washington D.C.

Uber allows travelers to request their favorite drivers and has even revealed how customer ratings work allowing riders to see how many starred reviews they've received.

But in Lebanon the app operates with impunity thriving amid chaos

“First it was Uber and Careem now it’s Bolt tomorrow it will be something else” says the stoic Walid. After he’s done with his day job he puts in several more hours ferrying people to and from the nightclubs and bars of east Beirut popular with tourists and the Lebanese diaspora in town for the summer.

For the young moonlighting taxi driver trying to scrape together a living in Lebanon a country facing economic ruin Bolt is just the latest in a cycle of apps that promise jobs and opportunities in an otherwise moribund market.

Worth over $6 billion thanks to a flood of venture capital from investors from Europe to China Bolt founded in Estonia in 2014 boasts that it is the fastest growing tech company in Europe. Company CEO Marcus Villig put it plainly in a January interview when he said that the downside of working in developed markets was “more regulations.” He contrasted this oversight and enforcement with the looser constraints of the Eastern European Asian and African markets where Bolt first launched.

In practice this means that in cities like Beirut Bolt feels free to impose conditions on taxi drivers desperate for work that would be unacceptable and even illegal elsewhere.

In June the GMB a general union in the United Kingdom that represents nearly half a million workers across industries took legal action against Bolt for failing to provide drivers with standard benefits.

“Guaranteed hours sick pay pension contributions” said Mick Rix GMB National Officer “these aren’t privileges to be bestowed when companies feel like it they are the legal right of all U.K. workers.” There is however little recourse for Bolt drivers in less lawbound countries where ridesharing apps are allowed to operate what the GMB describes as an exploitative “bogus self-employment” model that enables the apps to evade any responsibilities as employers.

In Lebanon Bolt represents an existential threat to the licensed syndicated drivers of Beirut’s red-plated taxi cabs. Many of these legally authorized drivers simmer with unconcealed resentment against Bolt drivers whom they accuse of flouting the rules and skimping on union fees.

According to Marwan Fayad head of the national union for taxis public transport and freight drivers unlicensed drivers who operate cabs for ridesharing apps cost legal cab drivers up to 80% of their customers. “We looked into the company” says Fayad referring to Bolt “and found that it does not have a license to operate under Lebanese law.”

But there is little appetite in Lebanon to enforce even existing legislation. It is in exactly this sort of regulatory chaos that Bolt exults in thriving.

Beirut’s Bolt drivers are not yet taking to the streets to demand better treatment from the company unlike their colleagues from Durban to London where drivers have objected to the working conditions and pay. Just weeks ago when Bolt drivers in London were striking a driver told the Socialist Worker that “we need to have a base rate of pay so it’s possible to earn enough to live.” Another referring to working over ten hours a day six days a week said “Bolt is destroying people’s lives.”

Protesters in South Africa in March included drivers from a range of ridesharing apps similar to Bolt and Uber all complaining about the impunity with which apps seemed to operate the exorbitant commissions and costs being passed on to drivers and the lack of any apparent criteria for who qualified as a driver.

Many Beirut-based Bolt drivers complain about the same issues — that the fares set by the app are not commensurate with their costs given that the prices of imported fuel and replacement car parts are sky high.

Lots of customers want longer trips says Jihad a driver working full time for Bolt and the app’s rates don’t account for the fuel consumption entailed in ascending the mountainous outskirts of the city. Bolt drivers describe a process of bargaining with the customer after accepting an order to try and agree on a price outside of the app: a risk for the drivers if the bargain doesn’t go to plan and the customer cancels affecting the driver’s rating.



On top of that the cost of mobile data which drivers use to pick up passenger requests was also hiked in July to five times its previous rate. Several Bolt drivers told me that they had sent emails to Bolt to request it take action to raise fares but that no one responded.

“We regularly review our fares in all countries. In Lebanon fares have increased by 137% since last year” says a Bolt spokesperson.

Uber the original ride-hailing giant was comparatively legally compliant when it arrived in Lebanon in 2014. But the leak of tens of thousands of documents has shown that Uber has intentionally exploited legal loopholes and weak law enforcement as a tactic in its expansion strategy. In 2017 an Uber driver who had a criminal record raped and murdered a British embassy employee in Beirut prompting the Lebanese government to describe the service as unsafe.

At the time Uber spokesman Harry Porter said the company used commercially licensed taxi drivers in Lebanon and that the government carried out background checks and granted licenses. “Only drivers that have clean background checks and clean judicial records are licensed. The suspect’s background check did not show any convictions or he would not have been licensed” he said.

A much-delayed inquest into her killing began in London last week revealing embassy staff are now discouraged from using the app.

Increased scrutiny on Uber in Lebanon though doesn’t seem to stretch to ensuring that the company provides satisfactory labor conditions. On July 18 Uber drivers began a three-day strike in central Beirut applying pressure on the company to revise rates in light of unaffordable fuel costs.

Government fuel subsidies once shielded registered drivers from volatility on global markets but they have now been withdrawn causing prices to leap 350% year-on-year between 2020 and 2021 resulting in long weeks of fuel shortage over a summer that saw disputes over the remaining dregs at petrol stations spark into violence. Prime Minister Najib Mikati committed to providing new types of government support and funding to the unions in October but he’s yet to come through on the promises.

Any fare-taking taxi driver — as well as the driver of a bus or minivan — is required by Lebanese law to purchase what’s known as a “public” number plate which different drivers said can cost between $7000 to $10000. These plates are colored or lettered in red to distinguish them from the private vehicles which dominate the country’s roads in the absence of a robust public transport system.

The number of red plates in operation is supposed to be capped by the government and though they’re expensive to get hold of they entitle the owners of their vehicles to state-funded social security benefits: with no public transport system taxi drivers count as a public service provider.



But Bolt Beirut allows drivers to register with a standard driver’s license and to operate private cars or even motorbikes with a normal white registration plate something union boss Fayad says is not only illegal but dangerous for drivers and passengers alike.

Lebanon’s authorities appear to be overlooking the transgression. “We filed a court case against Bolt” Fayad told me and though state prosecutors questioned union representatives about the claim they never called Bolt in for questioning. A Bolt spokesperson confirmed that Bolt had not been contacted by Lebanese authorities. “Bolt is fully compliant with the current transport laws of Lebanon” they said adding that “we are more than happy to collaborate with authorities to help them get to a solution that would embrace competition and serve the customers.”

“The government should enforce the existing laws” argues Fayad which specifically forbid drivers from taking paying passengers in private cars. The union held demonstrations this summer calling for authorities to take action against Bolt to prevent it endangering the livelihoods of those driving the 33000 cars allowed to operate commercially. “But the country is in chaos” said Fayad “we have no hope that anything will be done.”



It’s a lost cause to expect anything like government intervention according to transport systems expert Tammam Nakkash who in the 1990s was called upon to advise the government on public infrastructure design. It was a moment of optimism and desire for reform after a debilitating 15-year civil war. Nakkash has since consistently advocated for better provision of public transport in the country.

Back in the 1990s Nakkash says that he recommended reforms to the public transport and taxi system that would have made it fairer for drivers and for passengers. Instead the system is intentionally manipulated by a government so mired in corruption that international actors are unwilling to cooperate with it until they see evidence of serious reform.

Nakkash says that the red-plate system is wide open to exploitation. The plates get passed down like a type of inheritance he explains and at election time they are handed out as favors to secure votes so suddenly there’ll be a proliferation of plates for drivers in a candidate’s constituency. There are also thousands of vehicles operating passenger services with forged red plates he adds. Fayad estimates that there are as many as an additional 30000 cars operating as taxis with forged red plates.

Even the social security benefits that come with operating a vehicle licensed to take commercial fares are increasingly meaningless. State sector pay and benefits remain unadjusted to inflation and the precipitous decline in the value of the lira: the monthly minimum wage was worth around $450 in 2019 and is now worth just $24.



The complications around securing a red license plate — from the high registration costs to the politicking and law-bending associated with procuring one — act as barriers to entering the supposedly regulated commercial taxi trade. In these conditions Bolt presents a superficially attractive model to the thousands who have lost their jobs or found that their salaries are no longer enough to meet their needs as inflation has soared and Lebanon has slumped into what the World Bank has called one of the world’s worst economic crises in over a century.



F.C. was a working architect until his contracts dried up from 2019 as Lebanon went into economic meltdown. F.C. who asked to be referred to only by his initials decided to become a Bolt driver because it was so easy. “It costs $10000 to register as a commercial driver and get a red license plate to work for Uber or a normal taxi” he told me. And you have to undergo background checks. By contrast it took F.C. just six days to sign up and be approved to work as a Bolt driver.



Foreign nationals such as the thousands of Syrians residing in Lebanon who are unable to obtain official work permits are also able to work with Bolt. It’s another legal transgression that ignites division between Bolt drivers and the national drivers’ union.

Darwish Taha an Uber driver says that for other taxi drivers in Beirut “the problem with Bolt is that it amounts to slavery.”

If he adds “you don’t work with Bolt there’s no work and if you do it’s much worse as you get paid a rate around 70% less than at any other transportation company.” Nakkash the transport systems expert says Bolt’s clientele appear to be mostly middle and upper middle class young people and should be able to withstand higher fares.

Bolt though is in competition with other taxi services and with no prospect of the government holding it to account and on-the-ground costs that appear to amount to zero the app has carte blanche to charge fares around 20% lower than its rivals. And with growing unemployment and soaring living costs Bolt has little problem finding drivers willing to forgo job security and benefits in order to secure a paycheck however meager.

Last year a high court decision in the U.K. made Uber’s typical business practices — the model for other ridesharing apps like Bolt — effectively untenable. Such apps the court suggests should not be allowed to pretend they are merely agents facilitating contracts between passengers and drivers and thereby avoid their responsibilities to workers. Bolt indisputably exploits labor in Lebanon because it can get away with it.

The app is still too new for there to be any kind of organized labor group among Bolt drivers says F.C. the architect turned taxi driver. He and other drivers told me about a handful of WhatsApp groups some with as many as 250 participating drivers that are used to communicate about fare prices routes and also to grouse about working conditions.

“But I’m not participating in any of that” he is quick to add. “The app is good enough for now and I don’t want to be thought of as a troublemaker.”"

15 percent in taxes globally in each of the last three years

Berkshire Hathaway Amazon and Intel paid less than 15 percent in taxes globally in each of the last three years

Berkshire Hathaway Amazon and Intel paid less than 15 percent in taxes globally in each of the last three years

correction A previous version of this article incorrectly included Union Pacific in the table of profitable companies with low taxes rates because of an error in the source data. Its cash effective tax rate for the last three years is 18 percent. On Friday the House passed the Inflation Reduction Act which includes a minimum tax rate of 15 percent on highly profitable companies — a levy that could hit Amazon Verizon and others. The tax would help pay for large investments across climate and health care. But the minimum tax conflicts with a hallmark of corporate taxes in America: deductions and credits ratified by Congress.

Tax credits and deductions are purposefully designed as tools to incentivize certain behaviors. But because they reduce companies’ tax bills they stand to chip away at the effectiveness of a minimum tax. Companies can still use carve-outs for research and development investment expenses and others to lower their tax bills. Democrats’ marquee climate proposal comes in the form of tax breaks — which are also exempted from the corporate minimum tax rate.

Because of these exemptions it would remain possible for profitable corporations to achieve a tax rate below 15 percent Daniel Bunn executive vice president at the Tax Foundation a right-leaning think tank said in an email.

The minimum tax proposal would raise $220 billion over 10 years according to the Joint Committee on Taxation a nonpartisan congressional body that analyzes tax bills. The minimum tax rate would apply to companies that reported to shareholders an annual average of $1 billion in annual profit over three years.

More than 250 companies in the S&P 500 averaged more than $1 billion in pretax income over the last three years according to a Washington Post analysis of Calcbench data. Of those 83 paid less than 15 percent in income tax globally. The list includes tech companies such as Amazon and Intel banks like Bank of America and U.S. Bancorp telecom giants Verizon and AT&T and other household names like General Motors and UPS.

The rate is calculated according to global income meaning a company could in theory “have a domestic effective tax rate below 15 percent as long as their foreign profits were taxed higher” Kyle Pomerleau a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute a right-leaning think tank said in an email.

President Biden frequently notes that 55 profitable corporations paid no federal income tax in 2020 according to an analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy a liberal think tank.

The talking point sidesteps that companies often pay different amounts in taxes year-to-year. But it points to a truism that Democrats aim to fix: Over the long run many companies pay less than the current standard corporate tax rate of 21 percent.

Some corporations avoid federal income taxes by redirecting revenue to countries where they operate with lower tax rates. Until the end of 2019 Google’s parent company Alphabet licensed its own intellectual property from Bermuda — an offshore tax haven. Alphabet reported its global effective tax rate in 2018 and 2019 was lowered by billions because “substantially all” of its foreign income was earned by its Irish subsidiary according to a securities filing.

Corporations also lower their taxes through deductions and credits. Amazon shaved $3 billion off its tax bills from 2019 to 2021 through its use of stock-based compensation and another $2.2 billion for other tax credits including one for research and development according to securities filings. The company reported federal tax expenses of $4.1 billion for those years on $69.4 billion in pretax U.S. profit — an effective federal rate of less than 6 percent.

To gain the support of Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) Democrats amended their minimum rate proposal to exclude deductions for certain investments and exempt firms owned by private equity. Those last-minute changes will further help some ultra-profitable corporations to pay less than the minimum rate.

Last year United agreed to order up to 200 of Archer's flying taxis to transport travelers to the airport quickly safely and ideally with minimal environmental impact. The deal is worth approximately $1 billion with an option to purchase an additional $500 million worth of aircraft.

""To receive a cash deposit is validation of Archer’s achievements to date not only with flight testing and product development but also a great signal of confidence in our roadmap to commercialization"" Archer CEO Adam Goldstein said in a statement. ""We’re thankful to United for their continued partnership as we usher in this new era in air travel.""

Archer recently completed a preliminary design review for its production aircraft which it is aiming to launch as early as 2024.

OVER 1400 FLIGHTS DELAYED CANCELED ON WEDNESDAY

Once up and running Archer’s aircraft will be expected to transport up to four United customers at a time as far as 60 miles at speeds as fast as 150 miles per hour.

United estimates Archer's eVTOL aircraft could reduce CO2 emissions by 47% per passenger on a trip between Hollywood and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) one of the initial cities where Archer plans to launch its fleet.

""We believe eVTOLs have the potential to both help achieve carbon-neutral travel and serve as an innovative new tool to change how United customers experience comfort convenience and efficiency during their commutes within cities across the globe"" United Airlines Ventures president Michael Leskin said in a statement.

Leskin told ""The Wall Street Journal"" that prices for the eVTOL service will be comparable to Uber Black service but could come down over time.

The investment in Archer's aircraft comes as United has set a goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.

In addition to the aircraft order United has formed a joint eVTOL advisory committee with Archer to collaborate on eVTOL maintenance and operational matters.

United isn't the only one looking to take advantage of eVTOL aircraft.

In July American Airlines reserved delivery slots for Vertical Aerospace's first 50 VX4 aircraft after placing a conditional pre-order of up to 250 aircraft. The $1 billion deal includes an option for an additional 100 aircraft. The piloted VX4 electric aircraft will fly four passengers with zero operating emissions minimal noise and at distances of over 100 miles.

United Airlines gave a $10 million deposit to a startup developing electric aircraft — all for the goal of shuttling customers to and from the airport by air rather than gridlocked roadways.

It’s not clear when or if the plan will come to fruition as Archer the company developing the electric air taxis is still in the development phase. However the company said Wednesday that’s it’s finishing the design of its production model. Archer estimates the first of its four-seater helicopters could be in operation by 2024.

California-based Archer which was founded in 2018 has raised nearly a billion dollars according to analytics company Crunchbase. It refers to its aircraft as an eVTOL or “electric vertical takeoff and landing” configuration. The company states they’ll be able to travel up to 60 miles at up to 150 miles per hour. The aircraft is expected to lift off much like a helicopter and it’ll rotate its propellers from providing vertical to horizontal thrust while airborne and then rely on conventional wings to keep it in the air as it moves forward.

The company claims its vehicles will be able to land on helicopter pads and more general infrastructure such as the tops of parking garages according to its website. It also claims the eVTOLs will be quieter than traditional helicopters clocking in at 45 dBA which would be softer than the ambient sound of an urban downtown.

Archer is conducting weekly test flights of its earliest vehicle according to its website but whether the future includes skies dotted with electric taxis depends on whether Archer can get past several major hurdles. The company has to prove its electric-powered aircraft work can be produced on an affordable scale and get regulatory approval to take to the skies.

Archer CEO Adam Goldstein said on CNN’s New Day on Thursday that he intends to get all the necessary regulatory approval by 2024 citing recent comments from the head of the Federal Aviation Administration.

“We want to be very careful. We want to be very measured” FAA acting administrator Billy Nolen said recently on “60 Minutes” about approving aircraft like the ones Archer is producing. But “this is real. This is happening. We’ve come a long way from where we were just a mere decade ago.”

United plans to use the aircraft to transport customers on short trips to and from the airport citing in one financial filing that it could “reduce CO2 emissions by 47% on a trip between Hollywood and Los Angeles International Airport.” The initial $10 million deposit is for 100 of the vehicles with the overall deal expected to total $1 billion if Archer can deliver on its promises.

“These are trips that are less than 100 miles and we’ll use these aircraft to replace trips on the ground that are taking 60 to 90 minutes” Goldstein said citing the trek from Manhattan to Newark airport in New Jersey as an example.

A United spokesperson however notes that the Hollywood to LAX and the Manhattan to Newark routes are just an example and United has not yet laid out specific plans for where it will roll out the service.

Still there may be other hurdles. Archer will need to find a large enough customer base that can afford its services scale its business sell the public on the safety of its aircraft and of course do it all without running out of cash.

United which has billed its partnership with Archer as part of its effort to be a carbon neutral company by 2050 first touted its plans to help get the aircraft off the ground in February 2021 and they set up a joint committee to allow the companies to share resources.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWFuZGxldHNmbHkuY29tL3VuaXRlZC1haXJsaW5lcy1mbHlpbmctdGF4aXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,United Airlines Places Deposit On Flying Taxis,"United Airlines just put down a $10 million deposit for 100 electric-powered flying taxis a technology it hopes will one day serve urban markets. This marks the first cash commitment for an electric aircraft by a commercial airline.

United Airlines Places $10 Million Deposit On Flying Taxis

In February 2021 United Airlines signed a memorandum of intent with California-based Archer to buy up to 200 electric aircraft. These battery-powered turboprops can only accommodate four passengers but United CEO Scott Kirby emphasized their potential to reduce the effects of climate change:

“Part of how United will combat global warming is by embracing emerging technologies that decarbonize air travel. By working with Archer United is showing the aviation industry that now is the time to embrace cleaner more efficient modes of transportation.”

18 months later United has put down a $10 million deposit first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Archer has previously said that United will be the launch customers for its four-seat aircraft.

Michael Leskinen President of United Ventures hopes to offer pricing similar to Uber Black to use this service and sees operators like Uber and Blade as competitors.

Don’t expect these electric aircraft to be airworthy anytime soon though. First the Federal Aviation Administration must sign off on the safety of these aircraft. There’s also a question of how to integrate these aircraft into urban airspaces. Archer CEO Adam Goldstein expects approval to come by the end of 2024 with operations starting in 2025.

There’s a legal twist at play though which continues to depress Archer stock and a cast a cloud over the program. Archer has been sued by Wisk Aero LLC another air taxi company which claims that Archer stole its trade secrets and the Archer design really belongs to Wisk Aero. That dispute is ongoing with Archer countersuing for defamation and business interference. A trial is currently scheduled for August 2023.

United is not alone in pursuing electric-powered aircraft. American Airlines has pledged a $25 million invemenst in Vertical Aerospace Limited.

CONCLUSION

United Airlines has placed a $10 million deposit for 100 electric-powered flying taxis marking the first cash commitment for an electric aircraft by a commercial airline. Still questions remain about this aircraft concept including its sustainability affordability and Archer’s legal battle with a competitor. Any electric taxi service is not expected before 2025.

Severe thunderstorms around Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on Wednesday caused 100 American Airlines flight diversions and led to hundreds of cancellations that extended into Thursday’s schedule.

More than 320 American Airlines flights had been canceled by midafternoon Thursday or 10% of its schedule according to flight tracking site FlightAware. A total of about 700 US flights had been canceled by Thursday afternoon. More than 4500 flights were delayed by Thursday afternoon.

On Wednesday American canceled nearly 370 flights. A total of more than 1200 US flights were canceled on Wednesday FlightAware data shows.

DFW airport is American Airlines’ largest hub.

Southwest Airlines headquartered in Dallas logged about 250 cancellations on Wednesday according to FlightAware. Southwest canceled about 100 flights on Thursday.

Caught off guard by second line of storms

According to American’s Chief Operating Officer David Seymour the airline prepared for thunderstorms in the forecast south of the airport on Wednesday afternoon. But another wave came by surprise.

“Those storms then regenerated and created an entirely new and unanticipated line of storms north of the airport. This unexpected storm activity prevented all arrivals into DFW for a three-hour period” Seymour said in a memo to staff shared with CNN Travel.

One hundred AA flights were diverted and the airline proactively canceled all remaining flights into and out of DFW on Wednesday.

“DFW airport had gone 67 days without seeing measurable rain the second-longest streak on record – weather like this can wreak havoc on our operation. This was the worst storm we’ve seen at DFW this summer and to make matters worse there was no indication it was on its way” Seymour said.

He thanked American Airlines’ staff for their efforts in recovering from the weather disruption and noted that cancellations are “hugely impactful to our customers.”

“Canceling flights is a last resort” Seymour said in the memo to staff. “But doing so in advance – even with a small window – gives customers the best chance to adjust their plans and avoid last-minute issues at the airport.”

DFW Airport said Thursday that it has resumed normal operations.

A summer of flight headaches

Summer’s severe weather has been compounding other operational challenges including staffing at airlines and airports.

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has been working to address air travel disruptions as the demand shattered by the pandemic has come roaring back.

This past weekend was hit with delays and cancellations with Friday the worst day for cancellations since mid-June.

Buttigieg said in an interview on Wednesday with CNN that the air travel system is “very brittle.”

The Department of Transportation last week proposed a rule that would expand protections for travelers seeking refunds and the secretary invited the public to weigh in on the rule and to file complaints when airlines aren’t responsive.

The proposed rule would more clearly define cases where flights are significantly changed or canceled to provide a clearer path to refunds in addition to creating more pandemic-related consumer protection."

Existing delivery trucks and vans will also be fitted with ""air induction systems"" to relieve high temperatures in the back of the vehicles.

""Air conditioning is coming to UPS and Teamster members in these vehicles will get the relief and protection they’ve been fighting for” Teamsters General President Sean M. O’Brien said in a June 14 statement.

The original story continues as published below.

---------------------------------------------------------

UPS is one of the leading package delivery companies in the world. In 2021 UPS said it delivered an average of 25.2 million packages per day totaling 6.4 billion packages that year.

In July several record-breaking heat waves were reported in many parts of the world including in Europe and the United States. During that time a 24-year-old UPS driver collapsed and died while delivering packages in 90-degree temperatures outside of Los Angeles according to local news reports. An official cause of death has not been released but the driver’s family suspects his death was heat-related.

VERIFY sister station KPNX in Arizona also shared a doorbell camera video in mid-July of a UPS driver collapsing in the heat in front of a home in Scottsdale.

“I just want to make sure those guys are safe you know and with this heat those guys don’t have AC in those trucks” the homeowner who shared the video told KPNX.

Many people on social media have also claimed (here here and here) that UPS trucks do not have air conditioning. VERIFY viewer Kim asked us to confirm whether that was true or false.

THE QUESTION

Do UPS delivery trucks have air conditioning?

THE SOURCES

UPS

The International Brotherhood of Teamsters the labor union representing UPS workers

THE ANSWER

No UPS delivery trucks don’t have air conditioning.

WHAT WE FOUND

UPS delivery trucks do not have air conditioning installed according to the company and the union that represents UPS workers.

The International Brotherhood of Teamsters also known as the Teamsters Union is a North American labor union representing 350000 UPS workers. In a July 20 Facebook post the Teamsters discussed the trucks’ lack of air conditioning writing that UPS has claimed that air conditioning would be ""ineffective"" in cooling down the company's package delivery trucks.

“While UPS cites no scientific evidence to prove that air conditioning would be ineffective – and we can point to OSHA guidelines that clearly recommend such cooling is in fact an effective means for employers to mitigate the risk of heat illness on the job – there are steps that UPS should be taking right now to protect drivers” the Teamsters wrote.

The Teamsters gave UPS two weeks to provide detailed information on any plans the company has to protect employees combat heat illness and install or replace relief equipment amid increasingly extreme weather conditions according to an Aug. 1 news release.

A UPS spokesperson told VERIFY the company’s delivery trucks make frequent stops “which requires the engine to be turned off and the doors to be opened and closed about 130 times a day on average.”

“We have studied heat mitigation with our vehicles and integrated forced air systems with venting to create air flow around the driver and cargo areas. We optimize the roof of vehicles to minimize heat in the cargo area alongside insulating the roof of the cab. We also offer fans to drivers upon request” the spokesperson told VERIFY.

The UPS spokesperson said the company had instituted several new steps to support employee safety and comfort on the job in preparation for this summer’s heat wave. These steps include providing drivers with heat-related PPE such as cooling towels and uniforms with wicking dry-fit shirts and performance fabric shorts additional water ice electrolyte replacement beverages and fruits with high water content as well as accelerating the installation of fans in UPS vehicles across the country.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvdXNwcy1wbGFubmluZy10ZW1wb3JhcnktcHJpY2UtaGlrZS1mb3ItaG9saWRheS1zZWFzb27SAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL3VzcHMtcGxhbm5pbmctdGVtcG9yYXJ5LXByaWNlLWhpa2UtZm9yLWhvbGlkYXktc2Vhc29uLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,USPS planning temporary price hike for holiday season,"United States Postal Service customers may have to temporarily dole out more money this holiday season to send mail and ship packages.

A planned hike which is similar to adjustments made by the agency in previous years has been approved by the Governors of the Postal Service and would impact the price of commercial and retail domestic competitive parcels sent through Priority Mail Express (PME) Priority Mail (PM) First-Class Package Service (FCPS) Parcel Select and USPS Retail Ground. International products will be unaffected.

If approved by the Postal Regulatory Commission the temporary rates would go into effect at 12 a.m. CT on Oct. 2 and remain in place until 12 a.m. CT on Jan. 22 2023.

For example if the real estate produces a loss a determination must be made whether the loss is limited by insufficient basis or by the at-risk or passive activity loss rules which arise under IRC sections 465 and 469. When income is generated other questions arise including whether such income will qualify for the IRC section 199A deduction introduced by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 whether the income may be subject to the net investment income tax surcharge of 3.8% under IRC section 1411 and whether the rental income will be subject to self-employment tax. This article discusses the intersection of rental real estate and the self-employment tax.

In a Chief Counsel Advice issued on December 23 2021 CCA 202151005 the IRS discussed various rules relating to the application of self-employment tax by describing two general fact patterns. The CCA involved limited issues but provides a good starting point for understanding how the IRS classifies real estate rentals for self-employment tax purposes. Both fact patterns involve the application of IRC sections 469(c) and 1402(a)(1) to short-term residential rentals from real estate. IRC section 469 describes the rules related to passive activities and IRC section 1402 discusses net earnings from self-employment (NESE).

CCA 202151005 In the first example the individual taxpayer provided various services and accommodations with respect to a vacation property rented via an online rental marketplace. The taxpayer provided the following services: Linens kitchen utensils all items making the property fully habitable daily maid services delivery of individual-use toiletries and other sundries (not described) Wi-Fi service beach access recreational equipment and prepaid ride-share vouches between the property and the nearest business district. In the second fact pattern the individual landlord rented a fully furnished room and bathroom without access to most common household areas such as the kitchen or laundry room. Cleaning was only provided between each occupant’s stay and the example included no discussion of any other items furnished to the occupants. In both examples the individual taxpayer was not a real estate dealer. Surprisingly and without discussion both examples also stated that the rental activity occurred in the course of a trade or business. Because average customer use was less than eight days both activities were not considered a rental activity for IRC section 469 purposes [Treasury Regulations section 1.469-1T(e)(3)(ii)(A)]. The examples also included a statement that taxpayers materially participated in the activity for purposes of the passive activity rules but they did not describe how the required tests were met. The CCA concluded that the determination of whether the activity constitutes a rental activity under the passive activity rules is not determinative for self-employment tax purposes. In addition to income taxes IRC section 1401 imposes tax of 12.4% on the self-employment income of individuals. IRC section 1402(b) defines self-employment income as NESE which is described in section 1402(a) as the income derived by individuals from any trade or business carried on by such individual less the deductions allowed that are attributable to such trade or business plus the distributive share of partnership income. However IRC section 1402(a)(1) excludes net rental income from NESE unless the amounts are received in the course of a trade or business as a real estate dealer. In both fact patterns the taxpayer provided short-term residential rentals and was not a real estate dealer. Treasury regulations provide that rentals from living quarters are not considered NESE and are considered rentals from real estate when no services are rendered for the occupants [Treasury Regulations section 1.1402(a)-4(c)(1)]. The CCA discussed two examples that addressed the level of services provided to the occupants. With respect to the services rendered to occupants the two fact patterns present a stark contrast. In the first situation net rental income was not excluded from NESE due to the substantial services provided; in the second the income was excluded from NESE as residential rental income. These were predictable outcomes: What about situations not as blatant as the first fact pattern but perhaps not as starkly bare as the second? In describing services the CCA states that “services are considered rendered to the occupant if they are primarily for his convenience and are other than those usually or customarily rendered in connection with rental of rooms or other space for occupancy only.” For example the IRC section 1402(a)(1) exclusion from NESE did not apply to the rental of a vacation beach dwelling that included services such as maid services swimming and fishing instruction mail delivery furnishing of bus schedules and information about local churches [Revenue Ruling 57-108 1957-1 C.B. 273].

Discussion The Treasury Regulations provide some bright line tests which indicate that the following do not constitute rentals from real estate: Rentals in hotels boarding houses tourist camps or tourist homes parking lots warehouses or storage garages [Treasury Regulations section 1.1402(a)-4(c)(2)]. The regulation describes tainted services as those rendered to the occupant for the occupant’s convenience other than those “usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of rooms or other space for occupancy only.” For example the furnishing of heat and light cleaning of public areas and the collection of trash are not considered as services rendered to the occupant; the supplying of maid services however is. In cases where multiple rentals are involved and some include services for the convenience of the tenants and others do not the regulations clarify that the rentals must be viewed independently for calculation of the portion attributable in determining NESE. Unfortunately there is no bright-line test and all facts of any particular case must be carefully evaluated. A fundamental question relates to services that maintain the property in condition for occupancy; such services are not considered rendered for the tenant. If services are rendered for the tenant the next inquiry is whether tenant’s services are substantial. In BoBo v. Commissioner [70 T.C. 706 (1978) acq.] the taxpayers owned a 46-unit mobile home park in California. Because the park grounds were paved no landscaping or maintenance was required. The taxpayer’s resident manager periodically cleaned leaves and other debris. Each home space was furnished with gas water a sewer and a separately metered electrical connection. Tenants’ garbage was collected by a local company. An independent concession provided two coin-operated washers and dryers at the premises with connected water electricity and sewer. Machine repair was the responsibility of the concessionaire who also collected the deposited money. The taxpayer received a commission from the operator. No recreational facilities were provided. Rent was collected and general operations were performed by the resident manager. The central issue was whether the mobile park earnings were subject to self-employment tax. Because the IRS asserted that self-employment tax applied and relied on the fact that the mobile park rendered services to its tenants the earnings were not excludable earnings and did not constitute “rentals from real estate” under the statute and regulations. The court noted that because the taxpayer provided cleaning ground maintenance sewage and electrical connections laundry bath and toilet facilities and roadway maintenance he provided services other than those “usually or customarily provided in connection with the rental of space only for occupancy.” The ruling clarified that many of the provided services such as furnishing of heat light the cleaning of public areas collection of trash and others are not considered as services rendered to the occupant under Treasury Regulations section 1.1402(a)-4(c)(2). The court viewed most of the provided services as those required to maintain the premises for occupancy. Although providing laundry services does not meet that exception such services were provided by the concessionaire and the court found that this service was not sufficiently substantial and did not constitute a material part of the rental payments made by the tenant. The court viewed the laundry as an incidental or minor service to the occupant who “pays rent primarily for his space and the services necessary to maintain it.” The court stressed that the determination is based upon all facts and circumstances including the materiality of the nonexempt services and that each situation needs to be carefully evaluated before a position is maintained.

Commercial Rentals A common question arises as to whether 1) a rental real estate trade or business or 2) a taxpayer that qualifies as a real estate professional is required to pay self-employment tax on net rental income. CCA 202151005 stated that the rental in the second example occurred in the course of a trade or business and was excluded from NESE but the activity seemed quite limited. In Blythe et ux. v. Commissioner (TCM 1999-11) the taxpayer owned 10 parcels of residential real property. One of the central issues in the case was whether self-employment tax was required to be paid on the net rental income. Because the taxpayers claimed that they were not real estate dealers the net rental earnings were not earnings from self-employment. The IRS maintained that the rentals constituted a trade or business; therefore the income was required to be included in NESE.

Released July 28 the report details the increasing gap between renters’ wages and the cost of rental housing. The main takeaway from the report is that a minimum wage worker would have to work 96 hours per week to afford a modest two-bedroom rental or 79 hours per week to afford a modest one-bedroom rental home. Chairwoman Maxine Waters in her forward to the report stressed the importance of housing stating “housing is at the heart of a more just and prosperous nation” which is why the Out of Reach report is so important as it “sheds light on the reality that so many families in this country face.”

The U.S. Department of Housing Urban Development (HUD) defines FMR as the 40th percentile of gross rents for standard rental units of recent movers. FMRs are determined by HUD on an annual basis and reflect the cost of shelter and utilities. FMRs are used to determine payment standards for the Housing Choice Voucher program and Section 8 contracts. The NLIHC also defines full-time work as 2080 hours per year (40 hours each week for 52 weeks).

The Spike in Rent Increases Exacerbates Affordability Crisis

Housing is unobtainable for many Americans in 2022 as the federal minimum wage remains at $7.25 amidst an ongoing pandemic and rising inflation. Even in states with the highest minimum wages in the country NLIHC found that full-time workers cannot afford the average two-bedroom unit. NLIHC reports that Washington has a state minimum wage of $14.49 and a two-bedroom housing wage of $31.33; California has a minimum wage of $15.00 and a two-bedroom housing wage of $39.01. The report shows District of Columbia’s minimum wage is $16.10 less than half the $34.33 needed in hourly wages to afford the two-bedroom housing wage. According to the NLIHC report American full-time workers must earn $25.82 an hour to afford a decent two-bedroom apartment and $21.25 an hour to afford a modest one-bedroom unit at the FMR. Nationwide in only 274 out of 3000 counties can a full-time minimum wage worker earning $25.25 an hour on average affords a decent one-bedroom according to NLIHC’s data. In 2021 full-time workers must earn $24.90 per hour for a two-bedroom and $20.40 per hour for a one-bedroom.

From 2017 to 2021 rent increases ranged from an average of $25 to $39 annually the report found. Between the first quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 however NLIHC’s data shows that rents increased an average of $179. Rents in cities in high-cost states like New York show remarkable increases over 2021-2022 with Manhattan seeing rents rising an average of $554 three times the national average.

It may not be surprising that rents are unaffordable in New York but even in areas like West Virginia Arkansas and Puerto Rico which are seemingly more affordable based on NLIHC’s findings the median income are lower and they have minimum wages of $8.75 $11.00 $8.50 respectively which puts a modest two-bedroom rental home out of reach.

Factors contributing to the increased rent according to the NLIHC include housing shortage purchases by investors increased and rising inflation. Recent NLIHC research presented in their report The Gap: A Shortage of Affordable Homes found a 7 million affordable housing shortfall for extremely low-income renters a shortage that contributes to the increased cost of rent. According to the NLIHC another factor contributing to rising rent is rising inflation.

Those with Incomes at or Below the Poverty Level and the Traditionally Underserved Fare Even Worse

The economic effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic inflation rates not seen since the 1980s and a continued shortfall in the supply of affordable housing all place very low- and extremely low-income renters in a precarious position. Rent costs at or above $694 are out of reach for American families with incomes at the poverty-line. For people with disabilities who receive and rely solely on federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) NLIHC calculates that they can afford $252 a month in rent. The plight of seniors is not always the focus of housing reports but NLIHC notes that 4.4 million senior renters with incomes less than 50% of the area median income (AMI) are housing cost-burdened spending more than 30% of their income on rent. The NLIHC report also shed light on the continuous systemic housing issues as it relates to Black Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC) households. The average African American and Latino full-time worker earns on average $12022 and $12646 less respectively than the average white worker. According to the U.S. Census Bureau Native American households earns $46000 annually compared to $69000 for white households.

With the national average rent for a one-bedroom at $1105 per month and $1342 for a two-bedroom home coupled with inflation the affordability gap continues to widen. NLIHC reports that nationwide only 9% of all United States counties excluding Puerto Rico have one-bedroom rental homes that are affordable for full-time minimum-wage workers.

In the United States 11 of the largest 25 occupations pay a wage lower than the one-bedroom housing wage of $21.25 resulting in full-time workers’ inability to afford a modest one- or two-bedroom apartment at fair market value according to NLIHC. NLIHC takes 2021 occupational wage data from May 2021 Occupational Employment Statistics as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and adjusts it to 2022 dollars; housing wages were based on HUD’s FMR. The occupations represented below account for 35% of the United States workforce (farmworker are not included).

Bridging the Gap Between Wages and Rent Requires an Immediate Federal Response

Addressing the gap between what workers earn and the FMRs in their communities means developing a multi-pronged plan of action. NLIHC provided four suggestions on how to go about tackling the housing crisis:

Universal rental assistance must be paired with a commitment to constructing and preserving more affordable homes funding an emergency housing stabilization fund to aid renters in crisis and strengthening renter protections.

Highlighting Longstanding Housing Issues Can Help Mobilize Congress

The full breadth of the nation’s housing issues cannot be addressed without understanding the underlying causes. The NLIHC report put a spotlight on the unique experiences of low-wage renters and renters on a fixed income many of whom worked two or three jobs yet still could not afford rent and other necessities such as health care childcare and car insurance. In addition to the gap between wages and rents NLIHC’s report also highlighted the housing practices that it argues contribute to systematic racism that persist into 2022. BIPOC workers who are more likely to work jobs that provide a lower wage than their white counterparts according to the report face a harder time finding housing that they can afford. Moreover BIPOC workers who research shows can be paid less for doing the same job as white workers face added difficulties. Record increases in rents over the past few months have only exacerbated the already existing affordability crisis leading renters to mobilize to address the rising rent and voicing their need for safe equitable and livable housing as demonstrated in the Out of Reach testimonies.

Recent Congressional hearings on the need for more affordable housing in the United States coincide with the release of the Out of Reach report regarding. During Senate hearings that took place in mid-July a bipartisan show of support for the low-income housing tax credit was demonstrated. The fact that the Senate and House whose Ways and Means Committee hosted a housing hearing in July are taking the initiative to discuss housing should provide housing advocates with hope that Congress will turn its attention to addressing the nation’s longstanding housing issues.

But now in its 75th year the company has set forth on its own.

Founded in 1947 as the in-house equipment and tool supplier of Greenville’s iconic Daniel Construction Co. the company was known through the 2010s as American Equipment Co. during which time it grew into a $1 billion segment of Daniel’s successor Fluor Corp. which later rebranded the division as AMECO.

But gradually the company came into its own.

“What happened was we were able to create a private company mentality inside of a large parent organization” says Gary Bernardez CEO of the construction-site services provider that New York-based One Equity Partners purchased from Fluor for $73 million in May 2021.

Except for the six years he worked at other companies after 2014 Bernardez had run AMECO for half of the nearly 30 years he spent at Fluor.

“But my passion was what the AMECO organization was capable of doing on its own” says Bernardez who credits Fluor with helping him as a non-engineer develop as a business leader.

Likewise he appreciates the opportunities from AMECO/Fluor’s “tremendous history of doing some pretty amazing things in tough places.” He recalls for instance mobilizing with the U.S. military in 1991’s Operation Desert Storm as among many “crazy things” AMECO did.

“We had some incredible stories: calls from generals and bombs going off inside the compound” he says. “And every day you woke up working hard and trying to make sure that people stayed safe.”

While he once managed some 5000 employees around Fluor’s world he now oversees about a tenth of that number many of whom moved into AMECO’s second life as a focused independent company.

“The culture we created the first time” he says. “The people fell in love with the organization and all we needed to do was give it a purpose and a reason for people to stay engaged and I’m very proud of those that have stayed here.”

Still the company carries some of Fluor’s DNA he says. “They’re a part of who we are and who we’re going to be going forward but we’re also able to leave behind the things that don’t make sense for us.”

For one thing according to Bernardez.

For another AMECO can absorb other companies now too. On May 5 nearly a year to the day after the OEP acquisition AMECO merged with F&M MAFCO; the international supplier of tools and equipment rentals along with sales and service programs operates seven U.S. branches and three in Canada.

“We have a very similar legacy” says Tim Fries president and chief growth officer of the Cincinnati-based company that just marked its 77th year. (Bernardez happens to be an Ohio native.)

“You walk into their building and you walk into our building and there’s no difference. The culture’s very very similar” Fries says. “I’ve been through a couple of acquisitions and it’s creepy how smoothly this has gone.”

Moving forward AMECO is poised to take all that accumulated synergy to a “whole ’nother level” as Fries puts it.

And of AMECO’s renewed energy Bernardez says “You’re not starting over — you’re simply re-engaging with a different purpose re-engaging with a different level of enthusiasm and level of understanding of where the business can go.”

Generational retirements and a reshuffling of the general workforce known colloquially as the “Great Resignation” has many contractors eager to fill positions and others are looking at unconventional training regimens and emerging automation solutions to help meet their schedules and budgets.

But while construction goes through its boom and bust cycles many contractors are using the current situation to examine how the role of the equipment operator is changing as new technologies upend traditional construction processes.

By the numbers labor costs are up and skilled workers are scarce. In 2021 average base salary raises for construction staff jumped to 4.2% from an average of 3.6% in 2020 according to data from compensation consultant Personnel Administration Services. 62% of contractors reported high levels of difficulty finding skilled workers to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in the fourth quarter of 2021. And there’s no sign of demand for equipment operators dropping off any time soon. The U.S. Dept. of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates there was a total of just over 457000 construction equipment operator jobs in 2020 and that figure is expected to climb past 482000 by 2030.

There are leading indicators for how many operators are coming up and the number of people pursuing the required certifications to run equipment like cranes offers a barometer of the current labor market. “The guys who run the big rigs those are definitely retiring” says Thom Sicklesteel CEO of CCO formerly the NCCCO or National Commission for the Certification of Crane Operators.

CCO administers tests for OSHA-required certifications of operators of cranes and other equipment. In 2018 OSHA began requiring all crane operators to be certified. That led to an upswing in people seeking certification through bodies such as CCO and demand has been steady ever since says Sicklesteel.

“We see about 400 [crane] operators a month leave the industry through retirement” say Sicklesteel. “But we’re seeing about 1000 operators joining the industry on a per-month basis.” Most of the newer operators are starting out on smaller equipment slowly building up the skills to run the big tower and luffing jib cranes. “The average age of operators is declining and that’s a good trend.” Sicklesteel adds that CCO has also seen a surprising rise in operators picking up multiple certifications for different types of cranes perhaps reflecting a desire to keep their options open when looking for work in a favorable market.

Virtual reality-based training modules for equipment such as aerial lifts allow operators to test skills in dangerous settings like entrapment scenarios.

Virtual Training Takes Hold

Sometimes the issue isn’t a shortage of workers looking to become equipment operators so much as the throughput of getting them all trained up. Edmonton Alberta-based Serious Labs has offered virtual reality training for mobile elevated work platforms (MEWPs) for several years. Some of the most common pieces of equipment found on jobsites boom lifts and scissor lifts are deceptively easy to run and inexperienced operators can find themselves in highly unsafe conditions after only a few small errors.

“What we are seeing in the industry often is training on MEWPs happens very quickly—get them in and get them out” says Wade Carson senior director of product at Serious Labs. Rather than get workers up to speed running a lift in a quick session tooling around a parking lot for instance Serious Labs has developed virtual reality-based training simulations that place headset-wearing operators in various scenarios that they may encounter on a construction jobsite.

“You can get a good sense of [an operator’s] capabilities before they even set foot on a site”

Wade Carson Senior Director of Product Serious Labs

The VR system puts users on a simulated work platform with the same physical controls they would find in a typical boom or scissor lift. In addition to requiring them to perform tasks correctly the VR headset also captures where the user is looking and logs reaction times. “[Our system] identifies poor behavior—a lack of situational awareness or a lack of efficient movement” says Carson. “It provides trainers with that knowledge so they can focus their efforts on filling in the gaps rather than a ‘shotgun blast’ approach to training.” The company has seen a steady uptick in demand for its training in recent years and Carson says 44% of its customers are trade unions.

Serious Labs has advanced its VR to the point where this past June one of its scenarios was approved as ANSI- and ISO-compliant. Operators who pass a custom VR assessment scenario with at least an 80% proficiency now can meet MEWP 3b ANSI A92.24 and ISO 18878:13 specified boom lift competencies. These operators can be rated as competent without having to set foot in an actual boom lift.

“Our ANSI training scenario is very telling in terms of how capable an individual is” says Carson. Putting users in a simulated version of dangerous situations provokes different reactions than real-life practice. “You will never see a training facility where a new operator is operating a MEWP below a surface or in a confined or entrapment space” he points out. “This tells us if they are spatially aware if they know the limitations of the equipment. You can get good sense of their capabilities before they even set foot on a site.”

Serious Labs’ VR training for MEWPs recently achieved ANSI and ISO compliance allowing users to demonstrate competency without having to operate a real boom lift.

Integrating Automation

Contractors have sought to use robotics and automation to help control the sometimes chaotic construction process and to perform repetitive tedious tasks that tie up skilled workers. But bringing in autonomous equipment and smarter tools into construction processes requires collaboration to be successful.

“We don’t refer to contractors as customers we refer to them as partners because this is very much a two-way street” says Gaurav Kikani vice president of strategy at Built Robotics. “We acknowledge pretty humbly that we don’t have all the answers but what we can do is bring unique perspectives to the table and the ability to very quickly build useful technologies. But then we deploy and get a lot of feedback from our partners on how this technology can be improved to accelerate the industry into the future.”

Built’s autonomous system for large excavators works with a geofence and artificial intelligence-driven decision-making to create both safe operation and productive results. The system is fitted onto regular Caterpillar and Komatsu hydraulic excavators turning the controls over to an onboard computer that is programmed to perform standardized and repetitive excavation tasks as loaded prior to operation. On solar projects Built excavators were able to achieve 93% uptime at a productivity rate of 191 linear ft per hour a 45% productivity increase over a single operator toiling alone for hours digging trenches. The robotic excavators are overseen by a human operator monitoring their progress from an onsite trailer.

Kikani is working with contractor Bechtel in its role as EPC on solar energy projects across the southern U.S. First deployed on a Bechtel site in 2021 the contractor and technology provider worked together to refine the performance for site conditions found in the South such as optimizing excavator buckets to be able to handle the “Texas gumbo” clay soil.

“We’re working with robotics in ways to augment the personnel that we already have” explains Keith Churchill Bechtel’s chief innovation officer. “We want to leverage the expertise of whatever discipline or craft that robotics affects and provide ways for them to work better and faster” he says. “[If we] take away the menial tasks that are repetitive and really don’t require a huge amount of expertise [we can] put our subject-matter experts where they’re most needed on the most challenging technically demanding jobs.”

In many equipment categories the road to automation starts with better situational awareness for human operators. “We’re probably about 10 to 15 years away from fully autonomous cranes” says Asaf Yarkoni business development manager at Israel-based crane tech firm UltraWis. “But with technology [right now] the operator doesn’t have to think all by themselves.”

“We want to leverage the expertise of whatever discipline or craft that robotics affects. ”

Keith Churchill Chief Innovation Officer Bechtel

UltraWis’ current product offering adds an array of sensors and cameras to a tower crane. In addition to IMUs and load cells the sensor package includes LiDAR scanners that map out the jobsite as the crane swings around. This all provides additional views and situational awareness to the operator via a 23-in. touchscreen in the cab. The interface provides a real-time overlay of the operator’s view identifying obstacles and advising on optimized lift cycles.

The next step for UltraWis is to bring the operator down to the ground operating the crane from a trailer with a stitched-together immersive view of what is happening around their crane. Yarkoni says when this remote operation setup is combined with GPS tracking of construction materials and autonomous obstacle avoidance the industry may need to stop thinking in terms of one operator per crane. “We can get to two cranes with one operator or two cranes with only one signalperson. It’s a more systematic approach” he says.

“The beauty of the remote operator concept is that not only are you operating the piece of equipment you also understand the positioning behind it you understand the ground control you understand the setup of the equipment and ultimately you understand the productivity you’re getting throughout the day” says Churchill. “So you don’t have to wonder if somebody thinks you’re being productive or not.”

Lending a Helping Hand

Daniel Stone director of business transformation at Southfield Mich.-based contractor Barton Malow recalls the reaction from workers when the contractor first brought Construction Robotics’ Material Unit Lift Enhancer to one of its sites. The MULE is a pneumatically driven armature originally designed to help build masonry walls by offering a less physically intensive way to pick up CMUs. Once on site the two craftworkers set to be trained on using the MULE did not try to hide their initial skepticism.

“They literally rolled their eyes” Stone says. “But by the end of the day one of them went off and did something else because he wasn’t needed. And the first guy who ended up doing all the work said he loved it and never wanted to work without one.”

The growth of the solar energy market and the need to rapidly build out vast solar farms is driving new approaches to equipment. Barton Malow has delivered several solar projects in the Midwest over the last few years including DTE Energy’s LaPeer Solar Array located north of Detroit. It’s in these kinds of projects it has found its use case for the MULE. “We are working with Construction Robotics to build a rig that is going to allow us to place solar panels held by the MULE using silicone suction cups” Stone says.

A project like the LaPeer installation calls for over 180000 individual solar panels each weighing at least 70 lb. By using a lift-assist device like the MULE Stone believes the contractor’s laborers will be able to install the panels faster and without the repetitive labor-intensive manual lifting of the current method.

“If instead of having two people lift a 70-lb solar panel if you can have one person lift it with no weight you’ve saved somebody a day and you’ve also taken all of the wear and tear off the first person” Stone says.

Barton Malow has used MULEs on more than a dozen projects to quickly place and build CME walls. The contractor is expanding its use into placement of solar panels on utility-scale projects.

Barton Malow has used MULEs as well as Construction Robotics’ Semi-Automated Mason (SAM) bricklaying robot on projects throughout Illinois Indiana Michigan and Ohio. Both Stone and Bechtel’s Churchill stressed to ENR that they are looking for more than just how to fit automation into existing processes. They want to unlock the efficiencies of robotics to create better processes for both their workforces and clients. For SAMs and MULEs Barton Malow has found a compelling use case for them in soldier piles and lagging in bricklaying work. They’ve produced perfectly straight walls with mortar running in a straight line every time says Stone.

Stone and Churchill both tell ENR that they are also working with their suppliers to change how their materials are manufactured and delivered to their work sites to better accommodate their newly developed processes.

On masonry wall projects using MULEs Barton Malow is asking for 32-in. block rather than the traditional 16-in. 38-lb block that has been the standard for CMUs. That standard originally came about simply because that’s how much one person can comfortably lift Stone says. “We have a very likely project that’s going to go in Detroit to 32-in. block and those are 80 lb [each]” he says.

Contractors interviewed were all preparing for a future where skilled tradespeople will continue to retire at a steady clip and the younger generation of workers might not keep up for a 1:1 replacement. Creating new jobs where skilled labor is more about managing semi-automated machines is a way to hedge against that potential shortfall.

“You are either going to have trouble finding the right people or you’re going to pay a significant premium to find those people” Churchill notes. “As we see costs of everything else in the industry are starting to grow the cost of labor is going to continue to rise. It’s not just operators but multiple crafts where it’s just becoming more and more difficult to find the right personnel with the right expertise.”"

Surest introduced initially in 2016 as Bind has the fastest growth rate among UnitedHealthcare’s employer-sponsored plans.

UnitedHealthcare offers Surest to employers nationwide with self-funded health plans. Surest plans are also offered to UnitedHealthcare fully insured customers with 51 or more employees in 11 states (Arizona Florida Georgia Michigan Minnesota Missouri Ohio South Carolina Tennessee Utah and Virginia) with intent to add up to five additional states by the end of 2022.

Over 150 employers are using a Surest plan today including a growing number that are adding Surest as an option for the 2023 enrollment season this fall.

“People and employers are looking for a simpler and more sustainable health care plan” said Alison Richards chief executive officer Surest. “Our new brand name Surest helps convey the idea of clarity confidence and control our members have with their plan.”

Key features of Surest plans include:

No deductibles or coinsurance: Offering clear and transparent health care quality and cost data presented in the Surest app Surest plans help remove financial barriers to care and make it easier for members to understand both their coverage and cost before receiving care or making an appointment. Surest members more frequently accessed high-value and more convenient care including a 10X increase in virtual visit use2 and were less likely to use low-value care (6% fewer emergency department visits1). More than half the time Surest members selected high-quality health care providers with the lowest price for procedures such as hip replacement or reflux surgery.

Upfront prices: Surest plans enable members to review single all-in prices for more than 490 services before receiving care. Based on data-driven results members may be able to pay less out of pocket and receive more effective treatments from quality care providers as determined by national standardized measures. Access to clear upfront prices can help people avoid multiple or surprise bills.

Designed for improved satisfaction and more affordable premiums: Among people enrolled in a Surest plan the Net Promoter Score® – a key measure of consumer satisfaction – was significantly higher than industry benchmarks.1 For employers that introduced Surest plans costs were up to 15% less per member per month compared to high-deductible health plans while out-of-pocket costs for members were 44% less.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS91bml0ZWRoZWFsdGhjYXJlLWV4cGFuZHMtb3duZXJzaGlwLXN0YWtlLWFuZC1yZWJyYW5kcy1iaW5kLWJlbmVmaXRzLzYwMDE5NzQ4Ni_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UnitedHealthcare expands ownership stake and rebrands Bind Benefits,"UnitedHealthcare has upped its ownership stake in a Twin Cities business with a unique approach to structuring health insurance benefits.

The Minnetonka-based health insurance giant said it added to its majority ownership of Bind Benefits last year and — as of Thursday — is rebranding the business as Surest.

Financial terms were not disclosed.

Bind Benefits initially was designed as an option for self-insured employers — typically those with operations in multiple states willing to take on the financial risk for medical claims.

On Thursday Surest said it is expanding the number of states including Minnesota where its health plans can be sold as a ""fully insured"" option for employers. That means companies pay the insurer to take financial risk for the cost of medical claims.

Surest health plans differ in their benefit structure by asking patients to pay a variety of copays when they receive different types of care rather than meeting a deductible.

""UnitedHealthcare has always had a long relationship with Surest and served as one of the largest early investors essentially at the launch when it started in 2016"" said Alison Richards the chief executive at Surest.

Surest has been at the forefront of an emerging trend of alternative health plans that try to get enrollees engaged with making better decisions on where and how to access care said Brooks Deibele enterprise sales leader in Minneapolis for Holmes Murphy a benefits consultant.

The health plans provide a more personalized experience Deibele said and are offered by a growing number of companies including Coupe Health which was launched by the parent company of Eagan-based Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota.

""The plan designs are constructed to generally incentivize members to access higher quality and more efficient providers or more cost-effective sites of care"" Deibele said in an e-mail. ""They do this by offering some services for little to no cost or by providing direct incentives back to the member.""

UnitedHealthcare the nation's largest health insurer is the health plan business at Minnetonka-based UnitedHealth Group.

The company says Surest has had the fastest growth among UnitedHealthcare's employer-sponsored plans. More than 150 employers offer the health plans now Richards said and more are expected for 2023.

The advantage with building benefits around variable copays rather than deductibles and ""co-insurance"" fees Richards said is that patients know up-front what their out-of-pocket costs will look like and how they vary at different health care providers.

""There's upfront prices"" she said. ""Rather than offering just estimates that might be difficult to understand or compare Surest plans enable members to review a single all-in price for more than 490 services before receiving care.""

Bind Benefits was launched by Lemhi Ventures a Twin Cities-based venture capital fund led by serial entrepreneur Tony Miller. Some two decades ago Miller led a Twin Cities company called Definity Health that developed high-deductible health plans; UnitedHealthcare bought that business for $300 million in 2004.

A UnitedHealthcare spokesman said Miller no longer works at Surest.

Some employees in the business still retain a minority ownership interest at Surest Richards said. The unit does not disclose the size of its workforce she said but Surest employees are in all 50 states.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA4LTEwL3VuaXRlZGhlYWx0aC1pbnRlcm5hbC1hdWRpdC1zaG93cy1kYXRhLW1pc3VzZS1yaXNrcy1kb2otc2F5c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UnitedHealth Deal Questioned by DOJ on Risk of Data Misuse,"Why did this happen?

Funding is part of UnitedHealthcare’s $11 million in Empowering Health grants focused on expanding access to care and addressing the social determinants of health for people in underserved communities

BALTIMORE (Aug. 10 2022) — UnitedHealthcare a UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) company is awarding $500000 in Empowering Health grants to four community-based organizations in Maryland to expand access to care and address the social determinants of health for uninsured individuals and underserved communities.

In total UnitedHealthcare is donating $11 million in grants through its Empowering Health program across 11 states. The grants will assist individuals and families experiencing challenges from food insecurity social isolation and behavioral health issues and support local health promotion and health literacy efforts.

Grant recipients in Maryland include:

University of Maryland School Mental Health Program within the University of Maryland School of Medicine  Baltimore – $150000 for clinicians and teachers to pilot a Tier 2 prevention program for second through fifth grade classrooms in Baltimore City Title I Schools that are part of the School Mental Health Program.

 Baltimore – $150000 for clinicians and teachers to pilot a Tier 2 prevention program for second through fifth grade classrooms in Baltimore City Title I Schools that are part of the School Mental Health Program. Neighborhood Design Center Baltimore and Prince George’s County – $140000 to provide capacity-building and design services to community-driven food access projects at Pimlico Market & Café Central Kenilworth Avenue Revitalization and Capital Market and to develop a toolkit for future food projects.

American Heart Association Montgomery County – $120000 to work with the Primary Care Coalition to manage hypertension through the Target: BP program and address nutrition and food insecurity by equipping training and partnering with federally qualified health centers including CCI Health Services Mary’s Center and Muslim Community Center Medical Clinic.

On Our Own of Maryland  Baltimore Prince George’s County and Howard County – $90000 to conduct facilitator training to start and expand recognized evidence-based peer support programs such as Whole Health Action Management and Wellness Recovery Action Plan at five peer-run Wellness and Recovery Centers.

“Social and economic factors have a profound impact on achieving and maintaining good health” said Joe Ochipinti CEO UnitedHealthcare Mid-Atlantic Region. “Through our Empowering Health grants and local outreach efforts from UnitedHealthcare we’re working with local organizations in the state to provide Maryland residents with an interconnected system of clinical and social services that can produce better health outcomes and make the health system work better for everyone.”

According to the American Journal of Preventive Medicine approximately 80% of what influences a person’s health relates to nonmedical issues such as food housing transportation and the financial means to pay for basic daily needs. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused additional social and economic challenges that continue to affect healthy behaviors and exacerbate health disparities.

More than a third of members screened by UnitedHealthcare for social-related needs experience at least one social determinant of health. UnitedHealthcare leverages the company’s data to identify health disparities according to race ethnicity gender geography and education level.

Since launching its Empowering Health commitment in 2018 UnitedHealthcare has now invested more than $51 million in Empowering Health grants reaching more than 8 million people through partnerships with community-based organizations in 30 states and the District of Columbia.

UnitedHealth Group including UnitedHealthcare and Optum and its affiliated companies is dedicated to advancing health equity and building healthier communities by supporting programs to improve access to care and address key determinants of health. In Maryland this includes more than $6.3 million in contributions from 2019-2021 representing its businesses foundations and employees.

Additionally UnitedHealth Group has invested more than $800 million in affordable housing communities since 2011 partnered with food banks and meal-delivery services and in 2019 joined with the American Medical Association to standardize how social determinants of health data is collected and used to create more holistic care plans. In June the United Health Foundation the philanthropic foundation of UnitedHealth Group made a $100 million commitment over 10 years to advance health equity furthering its efforts to eliminate health disparities. This was the largest single philanthropic commitment ever made by the United Health Foundation.

15 percent in taxes globally in each of the last three years

Berkshire Hathaway Amazon and Intel paid less than 15 percent in taxes globally in each of the last three years

correction A previous version of this article incorrectly included Union Pacific in the table of profitable companies with low taxes rates because of an error in the source data. Its cash effective tax rate for the last three years is 18 percent. On Friday the House passed the Inflation Reduction Act which includes a minimum tax rate of 15 percent on highly profitable companies — a levy that could hit Amazon Verizon and others. The tax would help pay for large investments across climate and health care. But the minimum tax conflicts with a hallmark of corporate taxes in America: deductions and credits ratified by Congress.

Tax credits and deductions are purposefully designed as tools to incentivize certain behaviors. But because they reduce companies’ tax bills they stand to chip away at the effectiveness of a minimum tax. Companies can still use carve-outs for research and development investment expenses and others to lower their tax bills. Democrats’ marquee climate proposal comes in the form of tax breaks — which are also exempted from the corporate minimum tax rate.

Because of these exemptions it would remain possible for profitable corporations to achieve a tax rate below 15 percent Daniel Bunn executive vice president at the Tax Foundation a right-leaning think tank said in an email.

The minimum tax proposal would raise $220 billion over 10 years according to the Joint Committee on Taxation a nonpartisan congressional body that analyzes tax bills. The minimum tax rate would apply to companies that reported to shareholders an annual average of $1 billion in annual profit over three years.

More than 250 companies in the S&P 500 averaged more than $1 billion in pretax income over the last three years according to a Washington Post analysis of Calcbench data. Of those 83 paid less than 15 percent in income tax globally. The list includes tech companies such as Amazon and Intel banks like Bank of America and U.S. Bancorp telecom giants Verizon and AT&T and other household names like General Motors and UPS.

The rate is calculated according to global income meaning a company could in theory “have a domestic effective tax rate below 15 percent as long as their foreign profits were taxed higher” Kyle Pomerleau a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute a right-leaning think tank said in an email.

President Biden frequently notes that 55 profitable corporations paid no federal income tax in 2020 according to an analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy a liberal think tank.

The talking point sidesteps that companies often pay different amounts in taxes year-to-year. But it points to a truism that Democrats aim to fix: Over the long run many companies pay less than the current standard corporate tax rate of 21 percent.

Some corporations avoid federal income taxes by redirecting revenue to countries where they operate with lower tax rates. Until the end of 2019 Google’s parent company Alphabet licensed its own intellectual property from Bermuda — an offshore tax haven. Alphabet reported its global effective tax rate in 2018 and 2019 was lowered by billions because “substantially all” of its foreign income was earned by its Irish subsidiary according to a securities filing.

Corporations also lower their taxes through deductions and credits. Amazon shaved $3 billion off its tax bills from 2019 to 2021 through its use of stock-based compensation and another $2.2 billion for other tax credits including one for research and development according to securities filings. The company reported federal tax expenses of $4.1 billion for those years on $69.4 billion in pretax U.S. profit — an effective federal rate of less than 6 percent.

To gain the support of Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) Democrats amended their minimum rate proposal to exclude deductions for certain investments and exempt firms owned by private equity. Those last-minute changes will further help some ultra-profitable corporations to pay less than the minimum rate.

Latin America’s and Caribbean’s health systems suffer from structural weaknesses that became evident due to the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the countries have made efforts to increase spending on health their health systems are chronically underfunded. Underfunding accompanied by high levels of fragmentation and an organization that separates them into unrelated segments translates into a set of problems of sufficiency in access inefficiency coordination difficulties lack of solidarity and situations of inequality (ECLAC 2022). When considering the health systems indicators of Latin America and the Caribbean considering the condition of the countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) it is observed for example that the health per capita expenditure of the region is equivalent to a quarter of the value corresponding to the average of the OECD countries. This situation in turn translates into a relative scarcity of human resources around health and beds available for the population (CEPAL /PAHO 2021).

These problems worsened during the pandemic generating a situation of reproduction and deepening of health inequalities in which the well-being of the region’s population has significantly deteriorated. Faced with this and taking advantage of the historic opportunity that the COVID-19 pandemic offers the region to debate the centrality of the population health for sustainable development ECLAC has raised the urgency of restructuring health systems and moving towards universal coverage with timely and quality care for the entire population through supportive and sustainable financing models. It is stated that this must be accompanied by a sustainable increase in investment in health and a more efficient organization of health services in which the first level of care occupies a central place and is complemented by a primary health care strategy that incorporates the social determinants of health in its actions (ECLAC 2022).

From an international perspective various models of health systems and reform experiences highlight positive practices to move towards universal comprehensive and sustainable health systems and allow reflecting on the challenges these reforms imply. Within the framework of the technical assistance that ECLAC is providing to the Ministry of Health of Chile in matters of the health system reform that is under discussion this hybrid International Seminar organized by ECLAC with the collaboration of the Ministry of Health of Chile FONASA and Pan American Health Organization aims to learn about the experience of countries from different regions that have more robust health systems and are characterized by their universality comprehensiveness and financial sustainability. Furthermore this seminar provides the opportunity to reflect with the authorities and specialists of each country about the main challenges they face in their management as well as the main lessons and challenges from those recently implemented reforms.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndoby5pbnQvaW5kaWEvbmV3cy9kZXRhaWwvMTEtMDgtMjAyMi1zdHJlbmd0aGVuaW5nLXVuaXZlcnNhbC1oZWFsdGgtY292ZXJhZ2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Strengthening universal health coverage,"India’s National Health Authority (NHA) the implementing agency for the government’s flagship Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) programme together with World Health Organization and other partners including the Centre for Global Development and World Bank organized a knowledge-sharing workshop on optimizing and updating Health Benefits Package for Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in New Delhi from 2-3 August.

(This piece was originally published by the Casa Benjamin Linder.)

We’re settling in to our daughter Orla’s sixth night in the hospital. Visiting hours are over and only 10 of the beds in our 32-bed pediatric ward are occupied tonight down from 20 a few nights ago.

The patients – mostly young teens in our room – are tucked in under mosquito nets. Their caretakers – mainly grandmas aunts and moms – are slouched in chairs or curled around their patients on the beds. A few of us stretch out on unoccupied beds to get some rest before the nurse turns on the lights for the next regular blood pressure and temp check.

Our 14 year-old was admitted to the pediatric ward with dengue fever on July 19th Revolution Day in Nicaragua. Poor Orla sobbed in disappointment that she wouldn’t be able to celebrate the holiday.

After two days of fever I had taken her to the emergency room in our local Ciudad Sandino Primary Hospital where the blood work they ordered indicated dengue and showed that her platelet count was low enough to be of concern.

“She’ll be staying here with us” the doctor announced. Since then either my husband Paul or I have been with her in the hospital tasked with making sure she’s kept hydrated and informed of her progress via blood test results each day.

Dengue fever is a virus transmitted by mosquitoes that propagate in the tropics during the rainy season and it affects 50 million people annually worldwide.

Nicaragua works to control outbreaks through regular house-to-house fumigation and eliminating stagnant water – the epidemiology department of the health services visited our house shortly after Orla was hospitalized to get kill any mosquitoes or larvae.

There is no cure for dengue just symptom management over its eight-day cycle. The virus attacks the body and can cause leakage in vessel walls resulting in water loss in the circulatory system and rapid dehydration.

Much rarer severe cases can cause internal bleeding and for blood platelets to drop to dangerously low levels. Hemorrhagic dengue is particularly dangerous because patients can go into shock and die before they can get the blood transfusion they need.

Because of this risk the Nicaraguan Ministry of Health’s policy is to hospitalize anyone with dengue who shows signs of possible complications including low blood platelets. Thanks to this prudent policy and quality care Nicaragua is the country with fewer deaths from dengue than any other country in the region – in a normal year zero deaths.

Treatment for the 12 pediatric patients we’ve seen come through our room has been intravenous rehydration fluids and ultrasounds upon being admitted; blood pressure temp and blood oxygen level checks every two hours; daily blood tests; and constant monitoring of liquid intake and outflow.

Patients with fevers get acetaminophen; patients with suspicious pain are taken for another ultrasound; patients not getting enough fluids are put back on IVs.

Although the staff has been concerned about possible complications for at least four of our patients including Orla no one on our ward has been transferred to a larger Managua hospital for emergency transfusions; but the ambulance is standing by outside if its needed.

Knowing that gives me incredible peace of mind – at home how could I possibly have known what Orla’s platelets were doing?

Growing up in the U.S. I never had a close family member admitted to the hospital; in fact visits to the doctor were rare. As a kid I remember knowing that if I got sick over the weekend I’d have to tough it out until Monday when we could see the doctor during office hours.

A trip to the emergency room at the hospital – the only after-hours option in my rural county – was too expensive. For the most part everyone I knew only went to the doctor if they’d been sick for more than a week – their families simply couldn’t afford more frequent care.

By contrast Nicaraguans seem to go to the doctor all the time. If my neighbor’s kid gets diarrhea they bring her straight to the emergency room. I used to think this was because people were afraid – in the 1990s and early 2000s child and infant mortality rates were high in Nicaragua and many kids really did die of preventable diseases.

But as child health has improved – infant mortality down by 61% and chronic malnutrition reduced by 66% over the past 15 years – I have finally begun to understand that Nicaraguans take their kids to the hospital because they can.

Back in Idaho where I’m from Orla’s emergency room visit alone would have cost $2159 and her six nights in the hospital would have totaled more than $60000.

In the United States medical debt cripples 41% of all U.S. adults and they scramble to pay outrageous bills: more than a quarter of all fundraisers on crowdfunding sites are for health-related costs.

My mom has been telling her friends in Idaho of our woes. “My granddaughter in Nicaragua has spent the week hospitalized with dengue fever.”

“Oh dear!” Her friends all exclaim (dengue fever does sound awfully dramatic).

“Guess how much their hospital bill is so far?” She asks. They frown and shake their heads already anticipating that my mom is about to hit them up for donations for a GoFundMe campaign to help cover our bills.

“How much?” They ask.

“Nothing at all!” My mom gleefully reports. “Nicaragua has free universal health care!”

Her friends’ shock is palpable. “How” they ask “can a poor country like Nicaragua afford to give free health care to its people?”

The answer of course is because Nicaragua chooses to make free health care a priority for its people.

Nicaragua’s trickle-up economics

Nighttime in the pediatric ward means little sleep for caretakers. In the morning I wake at 3 holding a sleepy Orla upright while the lab tech gets a blood sample from her arm and then try to coax a bit more fluid down her throat. I crash back into sleep until the nurse comes to collect the papers where we write down our patients’ intake and outflow and do the consequential math: are more fluids going in than coming out?

Next the doctors arrive with the lab results for the day: who gets to go home and who has to stay. The hopeful have their bags packed waiting. The feverish ones stay wrapped in restless sheets in and out of consciousness knowing they’ll be here another night.

On our third morning I start awake at 10 minutes to 7 and rush to shower and change before my husband Paul arrives – bless him – with strong coffee and the car keys. I kiss Orla goodbye and drive straight from the hospital to interpret for a delegation that is in Nicaragua to celebrate the 43rd anniversary of the triumph of the Sandinista Revolution when the Nicaraguan people overthrew the cruel Somoza dictatorship.

Our first meeting is with Nicaragua’s Finance Minister Iván Acosta. It’s my first time interpreting for him and I soon realize that even with a full-night’s sleep I couldn’t do him justice with my interpretation.

He has an obvious grasp of details – quoting figures off the top of his head and speaking for two hours with no notes – but above all else Minister Acosta is a Big Picture person. He connects the dots for us between policy action and results giving perspective to Nicaragua’s entire revolutionary project.

“When we came into office in 2007 following nearly 17 years of neoliberal governments” he says “we found the country in chaos.”

Minister Acosta explains that the period from 1990 to 2006 when Nicaragua had followed structural adjustment policies of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund led to extreme inequality seriously deteriorated infrastructure and deep poverty particularly in Nicaragua’s countryside.

“There was no magic solution for any of this. What could we do?” he asks.

Nicaragua’s Sandinista government decided on a blend of social responsibility and economic principles. They began restoring rights – to free health care free public education and land tenure.

But they also worked to find ways to ensure that Nicaragua’s poor majority became active participants in the economy as a solution to improve the country’s struggling economy.

“We realized that we need to lower the cost of doing business to be competitive; in order to achieve that we needed to increase public spending.”

To that end Nicaragua set about building state-of-the-art roads – now the best in the region – to ensure that products could get to market cheaply and easily.

Nicaragua improved access to basic services: now reaching 99% electrical coverage up from just 53% in 2006; ending 12-hour a day rolling blackouts and diversifying to generate clean energy. Today 80% of the electricity produced is from renewables;

Nicaragua also trained new teachers and made new schools. And it has built 24 new hospitals since 2007.

Over just 10 years Minister Acosta explains social spending went from being 10% of overall spending to making up 57% of the country’s budget.

But have these policies been effective?

“We have these pro-poor policies but in many countries only lip service is paid to political policy and it isn’t followed by action” explains Minister Acosta. “So we do the math – all the various quotients and formulae recommended by international experts – to ensure that our policies are being translated into results: real improvements in the lives of the poor.”

The numbers show that not only has Nicaragua’s economy turned around – sustained GDP growth of 5% to 10% historic international investment and 90% food sovereignty have all been achieved – but also the lives of the country’s poor majority have improved. In 2006 GDP per capita was at $990 but by 2018 it had risen to $2300.

“We don’t have a significant middle class yet” Minister Acosta cautions but progress is being made.

Nicaragua’s policy could be described as “trickle up economics” – ensure the poor access to health care education land markets financing and the economy will follow.

This is the inversion of “trickle down economics” the U.S. policy made famous by Ronald Reagan which gives tax breaks and benefits to corporations and the wealthy on the theory that it will stimulate economic growth from the top down.

The problem with the U.S. policy is not only a moral one; in economic terms it just plain doesn’t work.

Under four decades of “trickle down” policy income inequality in the U.S. has grown to shocking levels: the wealthiest 0.1% have become rich beyond all comprehension while most U.S. workers now earn less than half of what they would have been earning if incomes had continued to grow equitably.

In other words tax breaks and benefits to the richest simply don’t trickle down: U.S. families now work longer hours for less pay while struggling to cover skyrocketing costs.

Currently 22% of the U.S. population can’t access health care due to lack of adequate insurance 12% experiences hunger and more than half a million people are homeless –many living under the country’s collapsing bridges – one in every five of which are in need of reconstruction.

Given what we know about how stability and quality of life for the majority can improve the overall economy perhaps instead of asking “How can a poor country like Nicaragua afford to give free health care to its people?” we should really be asking “How can a wealthy country like the United States afford NOT to?”

Nicaragua’s community- and family-based health model

“Dengue is treacherous” the doctor explains to me. “A patient can suddenly experience internal bleeding and become critical in the blink of an eye.”

Orla’s platelets have dropped and she is in the most crucial day in the virus’ cycle when signs of hemorrhagic dengue can appear.

As I sit on the edge of her bed urging her to drink more rehydration fluid a woman who has been visiting another patient comes over to Orla’s bed carrying a Bible.

“Would you like me to pray for your daughter?” she asks. Orla agrees and the woman asks “Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior?”

I stop her not wanting her to get the wrong idea. “We’re not Pentecostals” I say “but Orla believes in God.” The woman nods and holds her hands out palms up.

We close our eyes as she begins praying in a soft singsong voice asking God to look after my baby and heal her. When she finishes she surprises me by saying “It doesn’t matter which religion we belong to it’s all the same God.”

That day Orla turns a corner – her fever drops and her health begins to improve. I’m grateful to all those responsible – as we say here in Nicaragua “Thanks to God and the Revolution.”

Why the Revolution? Because it has restored Nicaraguans’ rights to free quality health care.

Our entire delegation gets to see the quality of this health care up close. After our talk with Minister Acosta we visit one of the best-equipped hospitals in the country Velez Paíz built new and opened in 2018.

Director Dr. Virginia Garcia tells us that patients with non-urgent emergencies wait a maximum of 30 minutes to be seen by ER doctors and that patients wait a maximum of one month for non-emergency surgeries.

“We have four laparoscopic towers performing gall bladder surgeries all day every day” she says. That surgery would cost $54000 in my home country but is free in Nicaragua.

I interpret for Minister of Health Dr. Martha Reyes when she describes to the delegation the advances made in public health over the past 15 years. As she talks it is easy for me to chart that path from policy to action to results that Minister Acosta talked about.

When she finishes speaking I thank Dr. Reyes personally for the quality care that Orla is receiving in our hometown public hospital. “Not so long ago” I tell her “that wouldn’t have been possible.”

When I moved to Ciudad Sandino 20 years ago our hospital was literally an empty shell unable to provide even the most basic services to our community of 180000. Not only did patients in “public” hospitals have to pay for everything from gloves to sutures but a dengue patient in Orla’s condition would have actually been safer at home – hospitals were in such appalling conditions with lack of staff beds and even basic sanitation that it was commonly said that hospitals were where patients went to die.

Thanks to public investment in health infrastructure increase in personnel improved and specialized training and tireless work to involve communities and families in their own health care Ciudad Sandino now has seven health centers and a hospital which includes outpatient inpatient and emergency care a maternal wait home rehabilitation and physical therapy services a natural medicine center and a center for cataract surgeries – all services offered free of charge.

Comparable improvements have happened all over the country – the change in people’s lives is palpable and the results in overall health are measureable: maternal mortality rates have dropped by 70% deaths from cervical cancer are down by 25% and average life expectancy has increased.

The privilege of free health care

On the morning of Orla’s seventh day in the hospital the doctor tells us that her platelets count is high enough to safely send her home.

We leave the hospital with nothing more than her official diagnosis paper a stamped doctor’s excuse for missing school and a follow up appointment.

We owe no money. There is no itemized bill showing how many nights (6) how many sheets were washed (3) how many cafeteria meals she ate (17) how many full blood tests (10) urine tests (1) ultrasounds (1) IVs (1) or how much oral rehydration fluid she drank (53 liters).

Orla and I walk out into the sunshine of a new day ready to rest and recover secure in the knowledge that the Nicaraguan government has made a choice to look after us … recognizing that it is a privilege to have access to free quality health care.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxldmVybmV3cy5jb20vd2hlcmUtZGlkLXRoZS1wdWJsaWMtb3B0aW9uLWdvL9IBPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxldmVybmV3cy5jb20vd2hlcmUtZGlkLXRoZS1wdWJsaWMtb3B0aW9uLWdvL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Where Did The Public Option Go?,"President Joe Biden has not once since his inauguration mentioned the public health insurance option he and every single competitive Senate Democratic challenger promised voters during the 2020 election.

The idea of creating a government-run health insurance plan that people could buy into has completely disappeared from the political conversation in Washington. Instead Democrats have opted to deliver tens of billions of dollars of new government subsidies demanded by private health insurers that have funneled millions of dollars into Democratic campaign coffers.

In their latest spending bill Democrats once again chose to give $42 billion in additional subsidies to private health insurers to help steer people into plans that feature high out-of-pocket costs and routine claim denials as those insurers continue to raise premiums.

The move further entrenches Democrats’ 2010 health care law the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the corporate health insurance industry — rather than bringing the country closer to achieving universal coverage and saving the federal government substantially more money in the long run.

While pundits frequently raise questions about how much money a single-payer health care system would cost no one in Washington ever seems to consider the cost of the subsidies being used to prop up the health insurance industry. The total cost of the ACA subsidy scheme would likely exceed $800 billion over a decade if these expanded subsidies are renewed down the road according to a Lever review of government analyses.

On Sunday the Senate passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) a spending bill that — among other key health care provisions — would extend expanded federal health insurance subsidies for another three years. The expanded subsidies were first enacted last year in Democrats’ American Rescue Plan Act to lower premiums in 2021 and 2022 for people buying individual health insurance plans through the ACA marketplaces.

For much of its history the ACA’s premium tax credits only went to poorer families creating what was known as a “subsidy cliff” that made it difficult for middle-class households to afford exchange plans. The American Rescue Plan expanded the eligibility criteria for these subsidies with the policy halving monthly premium payments for millions of Americans.

Those subsidies are set to expire soon; without their extension millions of marketplace enrollees would receive notices about sharp premium increases in October shortly before the November midterm elections. Making matters worse: Insurers are preparing to hike premiums more than they have in recent years with a median proposed increase of 10 percent for Americans on individual plans according to a recent review by the Peterson Center on Healthcare and the Kaiser Family Foundation.

According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities the IRA proposal would prevent 3.1 million Americans from losing coverage while lowering premiums for millions more. And thanks to the expanded subsidies 2.8 million more people received the tax credits in 2022 than in 2021.

While the subsidies are clearly helping millions of Americans gain or keep health insurance coverage during the COVID-19 pandemic they are also a costly and remarkably inefficient giveaway to the health insurance industry at a time when such companies are raking in sky-high profits — all while health care costs remain the top financial concern for U.S. adults.

“The First Thing I Would Do As President”

During his presidential campaign Biden pledged to build upon the ACA commonly known as “Obamacare” by providing Americans with a “choice to purchase a public health insurance option like Medicare.”

In 2019 Biden said: ""The first thing I would do as president is say look here’s the deal: We're going to eliminate all the changes that [the Trump] administration made trying to kill Obamacare number one and we're going to add to it a public option.""

Democrats previously debated including a public option in the ACA in 2009 and 2010 before dropping the idea at the behest of the health insurance industry and conservative Democratic senators who all went on to become corporate lobbyists or join Washington’s lucrative influence industry.

Biden and the Democratic establishment once again pitched a public option during the 2020 campaign as a compromise measure that could satisfy progressive voters demanding Medicare for All and one that would stand a better shot at passage in Congress.

However Biden has failed to push for such a vision since becoming president with Democrats instead rallying around expanded subsidies for ACA plans — an idea ripped straight out of a list of recommendations offered by health insurance lobbyists.

In fact since becoming president Biden has not publicly uttered the phrase “public option” or “public health insurance option” according to Factba.se a website that maintains a searchable database of all of Biden’s speeches and interviews.

There was a brief mention of “creating a public option” in a White House fact sheet for Biden’s proposed American Families Plan last year though Biden ultimately omitted the idea in his budget. As The Hill reported at the time “While Biden supports a public option for health care the budget did not assume the passage of any such proposal leaving out key questions about costs and how to pay for it.”

And while it seemed for a moment like congressional Democrats were poised to introduce a public option bill it wasn’t long before even progressive lawmakers gave up on the popular idea despite long touting Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (Ind.-Vt.) Medicare for All legislation that would offer every American government-run health coverage.

Just five months into Biden’s presidency Congressional Progressive Caucus chairwoman Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) deemed the idea “much more difficult than lowering the Medicare eligibility age and expanding benefits.” Democratic proposals to lower the age of eligibility for Medicare and add dental and vision benefits to the program have now also been shelved.

In the 2020 election cycle Biden’s campaign and Democrats’ Senate and House party committees received more than $4.7 million in donations affiliated with six major health insurers including UnitedHealth Group CVS Health (which owns Aetna) Anthem and Blue Cross/Blue Shield Cigna Centene and Humana. Those insurers all offer plans on state marketplace exchanges.

America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) the insurance industry lobbying group that spent more than $100 million to kill a public option in 2009-10 lauded the Senate’s recent vote to extend the enhanced ACA subsidies.

“Every American deserves access to affordable coverage and high-quality care and the Senate’s action will continue vital support that millions of hardworking American families need to purchase their own health coverage in the years to come” said Matt Eyles president and CEO of AHIP in a statement.

As The Lever reported last year an AHIP-led front group called the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future (PAHCF) led by lobbyists for AHIP drugmakers and hospital chains quickly signaled its opposition to the “Medicare-X Choice Act” a limited public option proposal introduced last year by Democratic Sens. Michael Bennet of Colorado and Tim Kaine of Virginia.

PAHCF spent $60 million in 2019-20 according to its tax returns. The group’s activities appear to have grown more sporadic in recent months.

Saving Money And Lives

Last week the Health and Human Services Department (HHS) announced that the national uninsured rate hit a record low of 8 percent in early 2022 in part thanks to the ACA subsidies.

While this may qualify as an accomplishment a relatively small percentage of people get their insurance through the ACA marketplace since most Americans are insured through their employer or public coverage. Enrollees in ACA plans also tend to experience high rates of claim denials in addition to steep deductibles and out-of-pocket costs.

Besides the news out of HHS means that tens of millions of Americans still lack health insurance while many millions are still underinsured meaning they cannot afford health care services despite paying for coverage.

Millions more Americans could lose Medicaid coverage when the designated COVID public health emergency ends. Worse still Senate Democrats failed in the IRA to close the Medicaid coverage gap for low-income adults in states that have not yet expanded the program since ACA passage.

Some states have taken matters into their own hands. Colorado for instance is creating through an approved federal waiver a public option plan that will be sold on the ACA exchange and could lower premiums by an average of 22 percent.

However Congress has not made any earnest effort to advance Medicare for All legislation or even a federal public option proposal despite the fact such a plan could be significantly more affordable for Americans and the federal government alike.

The new ACA subsidies will surely help millions but it’s a very expensive way to expand coverage. If you consider the cost of the existing ACA subsidy program as well as the new subsidies assuming they are made permanent the total cost to the federal government would be roughly $825 billion over a 10-year period.

By contrast an April 2021 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that a public option depending on how it’s designed could increase federal revenue — not to mention lower people’s monthly premiums and reduce administrative costs. Going a step further as The Lever previously reported a single-payer health care system like Medicare for All would confer several significant benefits including eliminating premiums increasing longevity and boosting the overall economy. And according to the CBO such a system could generate as much as $650 billion in federal savings annually.

Hamilton the President and Chief Executive Officer The Annie E. Casey Foundation in the report.

The troubling data of the 33rd edition of the Kids Count report Hamilton said couldn’t help but focus on mental health data “that reflects not only the turmoil of the past two-plus years but also issues that were making life harder for kids well before the pandemic.”

Within the full report analyses update trends in the well-being of children by measuring key indicators affecting economics education health and their families and community. All of the indicators are impacted by mental health Hamilton said.

Recipe for recovery

Families are taking notice. More parents are taking action to help their children. And the report states there are clear actions that policy makers can take to help families and their communities rise to greater health.

“The good news is that we see broad agreement on taking action” Hamilton said.

Nearly three out of four parents surveyed earlier this year thought their child would benefit from mental health counseling. Congress has shown bi-partisan support for legislation on mental health and substance abuse. The Biden administration has proposed several youth-focused strategies to tackle mental health concerns. And governors in 33 states have named improving mental health services as a primary objective.

The Kids Count report identifies three targets for policy makers to continue this momentum.

Prioritize kids’ basic needs. Children living in poverty are more likely to develop mental health conditions. Work to increase family stability fosters positive mental health and wellness.

Ensure that children have access to the mental health they need . That means ensuring health insurance for all children providing more social workers psychologists and other mental health professionals in schools and providing more federal resources to coordinate treatment.

Bolster mental health care that accounts for young people’s different experiences and identities. Mental health support should meet all children’s needs regardless of their race ethnicity gender identity sexual orientation or socioeconomic status.

Missouri’s child health concerns

State-by-state data showed Missouri with concerning trends in several health-related indicators. There was a rise in full-term infants born with low birth weights. After several years of decline there was a slight increase in babies born to teen mothers. More than one in three Missouri teens are overweight or obese.

Also Missouri is falling behind other states in ensuring universal health care access to children.

Trends that moved in a positive direction include a reduction in the number of children living in poverty and the number of children living in households where no parents worked. Also more children in Missouri attend pre-K programs preparing them for academic success.

Overall Missouri ranked 27th in the nation in child well-being.

Berkshire Hathaway is one of the world’s top investment vehicles a virtual cornucopia of public and private companies that are among the biggest and best in the world. Typically Warren Buffett is a fan of buying companies he can understand. One thing he clearly understands now is that while a “green environment” is something all of us would like to see the reality is that demand and the need for oil and petroleum-based products is not going away anytime soon.

Over the past year Berkshire Hathaway has been buying the shares of Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: OXY) and as of this week the “Oracle of Omaha” has amassed a stunning 20% of the company. Berkshire Hathaway now owns 188366460 shares of the stock and it is a good bet that Buffett could add more. The main point is that with over $11 billion invested in the stock clearly he and those making investment decisions at his firm think the price of oil is going higher and demand will remain strong.

Given this huge position and the prospects for the oil industry going forward as well as the fact that West Texas Intermediate crude has dropped 30% from the intraday highs printed in March earlier this year it makes sense for investors to own stock in the sector especially when the companies pay large and dependable dividends.

We found eight stocks rated Buy across Wall Street that are solid ideas for growth and income investors now. It is important to remember that no single analyst report should be used as a sole basis for any buying or selling decision.

These eight energy sector giants can continue to profit from elevated energy prices and offer investors who are more conservative a way to play the sector. With everything from the world’s largest integrated energy giants to one of the biggest refining companies these are eight ways to generate income and participate in the ongoing biggest rally in the energy and oil space since 2011.

Note that all these companies posted some of the biggest profits in the second quarter of any sector. While some may howl and scream about windfall profits taxes nobody stepped in when oil plunged to under $20 a barrel in April of 2020 when Exxon lost $20 billion and when oil futures were literally trading negative.

LAKE MARY Fla. (August 11 2022) - San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E) a regulated investor-owned utility providing energy service to 3.7 million people ordered Mitsubishi Power’s Emerald storage solutions for four utility-scale battery energy storage system (BESS) projects totaling 39 megawatts (MW) / 180 megawatt hours (MWh). The Elliot Clairemont Paradise and Boulevard microgrid BESS projects will connect to existing infrastructure in the San Diego region to provide reliable capacity and strengthen grid resiliency amid high energy demands on hot summer days and peak evening hours.

The Emerald storage solutions include the Emerald Integrated Plant Controller which is an Energy Management System (EMS) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system with real-time BESS operation and a monitoring/supervisory control platform. These control features will help ensure that critical public service facilities including fire medical emergency management and police are powered during peak demand and unexpected outages.

“We live in a time when growing threats from climate change and extreme heat waves can increasingly impact grid reliability” said SDG&E Director of Advanced Clean Technology Fernando Valero. “By expanding our energy storage portfolio we are helping our region and critical community facilities become more resilient.""

The microgrid BESS projects approved by the California Public Utilities Commission on June 23 are slated to be online in mid-2023.

Tom Cornell Senior Vice President Energy Storage Solutions Mitsubishi Power Americas said “SDG&E was an early adopter of battery energy storage in the western United States and it continues to be a leader in deploying energy storage to serve its customers. We’re excited to make an impact with SDG&E on these four microgrid projects in addition to the Pala-Gomez Creek energy storage project announced earlier this year.”

To ensure power to critical community services San Diego Gas & Electric is adding Mitsubishi Power’s Emerald storage solutions.

Pasaron tan solo algunos días de que se casó con Jennifer Lopez cuando sus fotos vestidos de novios en Las Vegas recorrieron el mundo entero y generaron miles de comentarios al respecto. Ahora se informó que el actor puso a la venta su mansión ubicada en Los Ángeles California con un precio de 29995 millones de dólares. Las razones todavía se desconocen pero por lo pronto ya circularon fotografías de los grandes lujos que tiene su residencia tanto en sus interiores como exteriores.

La casa que Affleck adquirió en 2018 se encuentra en el vecindario Pacific Palisades a unos cuantos kilómetros del lugar donde viven sus tres hijos junto a su exesposa Jennifer Garner. Esta ubicación era clave tenía el objetivo de estar cerca de sus pequeños y en ese momento costaba 19 millones de dólares. No obstante su valor aumentó gracias a todas las adecuaciones que le hizo el famoso según el medio The Wall Street Journal.

Esta mansión tiene alrededor de 4100 metros cuadrados dentro de los cuales hay siete habitaciones una sala de cine una gran fuente estacionamiento con capacidad de tres vehículos y otras amenidades dignas del intérprete de Batman. Se encuentra en un barrio exclusivo donde viven otras celebridades de Hollywood como Matt Damon.

Un portavoz del esposo de JLo fue quien informó la decisión de la venta pero no detalló las razones. Por supuesto en redes sociales las especulaciones no se hicieron esperar y muchos consideraron que la cantante de “On the floor” estaría detrás de todo a raíz de la vecina que Affleck tenía en esa propiedad. Pero estas parecen ser solo especulaciones ya que Garner tuvo un destacable gesto con la pareja tras la boda.

Cómo es la mansión que Ben Affleck puso a la venta en Los Ángeles

La mansión se encuentra dentro de una calle con bastantes árboles y está alrededor del Riviera Country Club. Es un recinto con un estilo bastante tradicional pero al mismo tiempo sencillo y elegante. La temática no sale de lo minimalista y de la gama de colores entre las tonalidades de grises y blancos.

No hay amplios registros de cómo es la propiedad por dentro pero con las imágenes que circularon en internet se puede apreciar que es un sitio muy moderno a pesar de que fue construido con una idea tradicional. En la sala de estar predomina la luz por los grandes ventanales que van desde el suelo y hasta el techo que se complementan perfectamente con el color blanco de todas las paredes.

Por fuera antes del enorme jardín hay un comedor sencillo que pudo servir para que los recién casados disfrutaran los días de verano con un desayuno bajo la luz de la mañana un momento que no se cumplirá porque la mansión pronto tendrá otro dueño.

Diferente a lo que se ve en otros sitios en los que se trata de hacer contraste con los muebles en la casa de Affleck sucede todo lo contrario y optó por tener un estilo monocromático al comprarlos del mismo estilo y tono que toda la decoración.

Hay otro ambiente que parece ser una sala de juegos por la mesa de billar que tiene en el centro y el minibar ubicado en una de las esquinas. Si bien aquí hay un poco más de muebles de otro color también se trató de destacar el mismo estilo clásico con el blanco como tono predominante.

At first glance it's easy to chalk up Verizon's (VZ 1.38%) second-quarter net loss of 215000 postpaid wireless customers to price hikes put in place during the three-month stretch in question. Fortunately the company had a better showing on the business front picking up (again on a net basis) 430000 postpaid customers. Still following its first-quarter attrition of 292000 postpaid consumers that preceded any major price hikes shareholders have good reason to be concerned. That's particularly true in light of the fact that competitors AT&T (T 0.06%) and T-Mobile (TMUS -0.20%) managed to add 813000 and 380000 postpaid accounts respectively during the same quarter. Clearly it can be done.

Verizon's woes may go well beyond competing plans from the industry's other two established powerhouses though; T-Mobile's and AT&T's pricing plans aren't dramatically different in fact. Rather the market's cost-conscious crowd is slowly switching to a couple of wireless service providers that should concern T-Mobile and AT&T just as much as it does Verizon.

Those alternative wireless services? For most consumers it's your local cable TV company.

Unexpected disruptors

You're reading that right. If you're a current customer of Charter Communications' (CHTR 4.44%) Spectrum or Comcast's (CMCSA 1.92%) Xfinity you're likely eligible for surprisingly cheap wireless service offered by either of the two brands. Xfinity's plans start at $15 per month but even a robust plan can cost you less than $50. Spectrum's plans are in the same ballpark with two lines offered at $30 per month for customers willing to sign a one-year contract.

And odds are good you're a customer of at least one of the two giant cable telcos. The two collectively account for about two-thirds of the industry's customers after all according to data from Leichtman Research Group.

Consumers are clearly making their way to these more affordable plans too. Charter's Spectrum added 329000 wireless consumers to the fold last quarter bringing its headcount to a little over 4.1 million customers. Factor in its business mobility lines and the figure nears 4.3 million. Comcast's Xfinity picked up 317000 wireless customers during the same three-month stretch to bring its customer count to just over 4.6 million.

Even Dish Network (DISH) and Altice (ATUS 3.57%) are in the business. Altice is serving 231000 wireless accounts as of the end of June and Dish's Boost Mobile boasts nearly 7.9 million subscribers (though they're handled by T-Mobile's infrastructure). Even taking Dish's Boost out of the equation that's more than 9 million consumers' and small businesses' wireless needs being met by cable television companies.

Or look at it this way: That's more than 9 million accounts that just a few years ago -- before cable companies got into the wireless business -- would have been Verizon's AT&T's or T-Mobile's. With a lower-cost option on the table though the industry's old guard is clearly on the defensive. Verizon just happens to be highlighted as the laggard of late because its recent price increases took the most obvious recent toll.

Past time for a bold direct response

It's not a perfect apples-to-apples comparison. Xfinity and Spectrum rely heavily on their cable and broadband lines to handle their wireless services' connectivity work while a customer is within radio reach of this infrastructure. That's infrastructure that Verizon and the wireless industry's other stalwarts just don't have (at least not yet -- Verizon continues to invest heavily in its fiber-optic network). Only once an Xfinity or Spectrum wireless subscriber moves out of reach of this infrastructure are they passed off to a more conventional mobile network. It remains to be seen how long this approach will support the ever-growing data needs of the ever-growing usage of mobile devices but it's working well enough for now.

One thing is clear: The traditional wireless carriers underestimated how disruptive this new type of wireless competition could be particularly on the price front. Now they're paying the price in the form of slowing growth at a time when the market itself is already saturated. Pew Research reports that 95% of U.S. residents already own a cellphone adding that 85% of them already own smartphones.

Current and would-be shareholders of Verizon as well as its two biggest rivals should be looking for ways these players are specifically responding to this unexpected low-cost competition. Thus far they've not done enough.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNvdXRod2VzdHZvaWNlcy5uZXdzL3Bvc3RzL2tpbmdmaWVsZC1yZXNpZGVudHMtcmVzaXN0LXZlcml6b24tNWctdG93ZXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kingfield residents resist Verizon 5G towers,"Kingfield residents have been organizing this summer to stop the installation of a 5G antenna pole at 41st and Garfield including physically blocking the pole’s location.

Verizon 5G antenna poles are being installed throughout the city which boost internet speeds nearby. The transmission of 5G creates a faster internet speed for people but the coverage goes a short distance. It’s like FM/AM radio–FM radio has high quality sound but the station coverage area is small compared to AM radio that has a farther reach but a lower quality sound.

‍

A group of Kingfield residents took note of the colloquially-known “5G towers” popping up in their neighborhood this summer and quickly started organizing to stop anymore from going in. The group wants to know more about the physical and environmental impact of 5G technology and why public space is being given over to corporations like Verizon.

Residents are concerned about people with electromagnetic sensitivity being exposed to high rates of radio frequency energy. Mary Bacon a Kingfield resident who is fighting against the Kingfield 5G antenna pole installation said there is “not a good set of regulations” around wireless communication technology because “the FCC is dragging their feet.”

The Federal Communications Commission & 5G safety

The Federal Communications Commission or FCC is in charge of regulating telecommunications technology including telephone wire fiber optic cables and wireless technology like 5G. Newer smartphones are now equipped with 5G capabilities.

According to the FCC “there is no consistent or credible scientific evidence of health problems caused by the exposure to radio frequency energy emitted by cell phones.” In 2019 the FCC voted to maintain its existing radio frequency exposure standards given the lack of scientific evidence showing bodily harm caused by 5G technology. The FCC last updated its standards in 1996.

In 2021 a federal court ruled in favor of an environmental rights group that sued the FCC. They argued that the FCC had not taken into account new scientific evidence when it was deciding whether to update its guidelines for exposure to radiation from cellphones and cell towers. In the ruling the court said the FCC had to act in good faith to review the evidence again and provide strong reasoning for not updating its radio frequency energy guidelines.

In its Radio Frequency Safety FAQ the FCC states “Measurements made near typical cellular and [personal communication systems] installations especially those with tower-mounted antennas have shown that ground-level power densities are hundreds to thousands of times less than the FCC's limits for safe exposure.”

Since 2021 the FCC has been awarding major telecom corporations like AT&T and Verizon 5G technology installation contracts around the country. Nationally airports have been asking these companies to curb 5G tower installation due to concerns of radio interference.

The FCC chairperson from 2017-2021 was Ajit Pai a former lawyer for Verizon. In 2021Jessica Rosenworcel a longtime lawyer and FCC commissioner took over as FCC chair.

Wireless technology like 5G is one way to expand access to the internet. Major internet corporations such as Xfinity/Comcast have long been criticized for limiting broadband internet technology in rural and urban areas. This inequity was deeply felt during the first wave of the U.S. COVID-19 pandemic.

Physically standing in the way

Both Bacon and Julie Ristau another Kingfield resident protesting against the 5G towers insist they are not against technology.

“We just want it to be safe” Bacon said.

The first time Ristau went out to the 5G antenna pole’s planned location was on May 31. She stood in the way of the installation at 41st and Garfield and successfully stopped the pole from going up.

“It was a week before then that one of my housemates noted there was action on the corner and talked with the folks doing the preliminary wiring” Ristau said.

June 9 was Verizon’s second attempt at installing the 5G tower. This time the Minneapolis Police Department were called by Verizon to the corner.

“The police were sympathetic to our actions of protecting our rights to learn more and understand what was going on” Ristau said.

Editor’s note: A request for incident reports with the Minneapolis Police Department regarding the 5G tower installation is pending with the City of Minneapolis.

July 15 was Verizon’s last known attempt to install the pole. “One of our group members called the police ahead of time” Ristau said. According to Ristau there was an MPD officer on the scene at 7 a.m. “monitoring the situation.”

“We were nice” Ristau said of the Kingfield protestors’ behavior. “We just stand there.”

The 5G antenna poles are privately-owned on city property. Two 2017 statutes redefined how and what kinds of telecommunication and wireless technology could be placed in a public right-of-way effectively regulating and allowing for 5G towers to be installed. Given the new statues a lot of 5G towers are going in.

A City of Minneapolis webpage acknowledges the drastic increase in new antenna poles. “As the antenna network continues to expand the percentage of privately-owned antenna poles continues to increase” the city’s “Privately owned small cell antenna poles within City right-of-way” webpage reads.

According to Ristau the Kingfield group’s next step is to get a cease and desist order for Verizon’s 5G towers at least until City Council President and Ward 8 Councilmember Andrea Jenkins can hold a public forum on the towers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYW5uZWxmdXR1cmVzLmNvbS9wZW9wbGUtb24tdGhlLW1vdmUvc2FyYWgtbWFyc2gtYWR2b2NhdGUtZm9yLWFnZW50LXZhci1wcm9ncmFtcy1sZWF2aW5nLXZlcml6b27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sarah Marsh Advocate for Agent VAR Partner Strategy Leaving Verizon,"Sarah Marsh a 16-year Verizon alumna and a key figure in the carrier’s partner strategy is moving to a new opportunity.

Verizon’s director of channel strategy and sales enablement told Channel Futures that she is leaving the company. During her tenure Verizon expanded partners’ product portfolios and tackled channel conflict.

Verizon’s Sarah Marsh

“I’m incredibly passionate about the channel and unlocking the full potential of partnerships. I spent a lot of time educating leaders across the business from product to finance to sales on the unique capabilities distribution and value our partners can provide both customers and our business” Marsh said.

Marsh has been working in channel leadership for the last seven years at Verizon. Among her accomplishments is the launching of a two-tier agent channel for wireless in 2019. This program lets partners sell both wireless and wireline offerings Marsh said.

Marsh from 2016-2020 led Verizon Business’ mobility channels overseeing sales operations strategy and enablement. The company relaunched its distribution channel which it now refers to as its Mobility Co-Sell Program. Marsh said the program grew 480% under her oversight and now represents Verizon’s largest channel program.

Here’s our list of channel people on the move in July.

“I’m very grateful that I had such a unique opportunity to lead a ‘startup’ within such a large organization. Verizon enabled me to innovate build and launch new programs and routes to market.”

Most recently Marsh oversaw Verizon’s internal partner roadshow which emphasized collaboration between elite VAR partners and Verizon sales teams. This Elite VAR program came out of the Mobility Co-Sell Program.

Marsh joined Verizon as an account executive in 2006. She served in various sales teams serving different business customer segments. She made the company’s President Cabinet three times.

Evolving Verizon Partner Strategy

Marsh said 16 different Verizon channel programs have consolidated over the last two years. At the same time Verizon launched the Verizon Partner Network as the flagship brand of its channel. She said Verizon’s partner ecosystem includes more than 5000 companies including distributors resellers systems integrators and agents.

Verizon in this time has also expanded MDF and introduced more partner enablement tools. In addition the carrier launched a partner advisory council.

Marsh said indirect sales have risen in priority for the larger Verizon business organization.

“Verizon was historically a direct-centric company but channel provides immense opportunities to reach more customers how and where they want to buy” Marsh told Channel Futures. “It’s exciting to see the investments and the commitment to channel increase over the last several years.

But the cure has yet to arrive and Ms. Hepner 51 a filmmaker from Los Angeles remains hobbled by her body’s inability to make insulin the sugar-regulating hormone produced by the pancreas. “I might look fine to you” she said “but I feel crappy 70 percent of the time.”

Staying healthy can be exhausting for many of the 37 million Americans with some form of diabetes. There’s the round-the-clock monitoring of sugar levels; the constant life-sustaining insulin injections; and the potential threats from diabetes’ diabolical complications: heart disease blindness kidney damage and the possibility of losing a gangrenous limb to amputation.

“‘The cure is five years away’ has become a joke in the diabetes community” Ms. Hepner said. “If it’s so close then what’s taking so long? And in the meantime millions of us have died.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8xMS9idXNpbmVzcy9tb2Rlcm5hLWNvdmlkLXZhY2NpbmVzLWFubnVhbC1ib29zdGVyLWludGwtaG5rL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Moderna CEO says Covid vaccines will evolve like ‘an iPhone’,"CNN Business —

Forget taking two to three Covid shots a year. Moderna hopes to roll out a single-dose annual booster to cover the coronavirus the flu and another common respiratory virus within the next five years.

As Covid-19 continues to mutate Moderna will need to keep updating the vaccines that turned it into a global household name while trying to make it more convenient for consumers CEO Stéphane Bancel said in an interview with CNN Business Wednesday.

He estimated a timeline of “three to five years” for the new combined product and likened the development of the life-saving jab to that of a smartphone.

“You don’t get the amazing camera amazing everything the first time you get an iPhone but you get a lot of things” he said.

“A lot of us buy a new iPhone every September and you get new apps and you get refreshed apps. And that’s exactly the same idea which is you’ll get Covid and flu and RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] in your single dose.”

Having recorded breakneck growth during the pandemic Moderna (MRNA) is now under pressure to identify its next big frontier.

Bancel believes the Covid-19 pandemic that helped the company rack up tens of billions of dollars in revenue and generate business in more than 70 markets globally could end as soon as this year.

That doesn’t mean the virus is going anywhere he noted.

“I think we are slowly moving — if not already in some countries — to a world where all the tools are available and everybody can make their own decision based on their risk tolerance” he explained adding that he believed more people would choose to “live with the virus” much like they do with the flu.

The approach however will continue to vary greatly such as among people who are immunocompromised or in countries like Japan where it was common to wear masks even before the pandemic he acknowledged.

And “there’s always a 20% probability that we get a very nasty variant that drives very severe disease that has a lot of mutation” he added.

The next big thing

Still Moderna is determined not to become a one-hit wonder.

The company has more than 40 products in development and is planning for life well beyond Covid-19 said Bancel.

In addition to an updated annual booster it is continuing to develop a personalized cancer vaccine for which new clinical data will drop later this year. Bancel said the product could go up for approval in roughly two years if all goes well.

The company is also exploring a potential monkeypox jab which is “still in the lab today” Bancel said. The World Health Organization declared the global outbreak of the illness a public health emergency of international concern last month.

And Moderna is looking to catch up to competitors overseas.

Earlier this year it announced a push into 10 Asian and European markets including Singapore Hong Kong Denmark and the Netherlands. The investments will cost “dozens of millions of dollars” and include hundreds of new hires said Bancel.

He sees that as just one wave of expansion that will eventually take Moderna from directly operating in 12 countries this year to “40 to 60 countries” over the next three years.

The company also recently signed manufacturing agreements in the United Kingdom South Korea and Australia and is hoping to set up one or two more plants in Southeast Asia or North Asia.

Bancel said the new facilities would be crucial to helping adapt its products to different strains of illnesses that develop around the world.

As the world first dealt with the onset of Covid-19 Moderna was one of the handful of large manufacturers that rushed to get their vaccines ready reducing timelines from years to months. Its stock rallied 434% in 2020 and 143% last year.

But now like peers Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) the firm’s stock has slumped dropping more than 30% so far this year and 64% from its all-time high a year ago.

Last week the company revealed that it took a writedown of nearly $500 million in the second quarter partly because of a sudden cancellation of orders from Covax the international vaccination program for lower-income countries.

The reversal led to huge losses for the company which had bought new machines to fulfill those orders and more importantly resulted in Covid vaccines being thrown in the trash said Bancel.

“We ended up destroying the vaccines” he said. “It was really heartbreaking.”

The CEO said he wasn’t worried about that kind of slide in demand being repeated in richer countries in part because governments had already shown commitments to use vaccines later this year to avoid reintroducing economic lockdowns.

But “on the low-income country side yes I am worried” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sYWJwdWxzZS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MtaW5zaWdodHMvcG9saWN5LWFuZC1yZWd1bGF0aW9uL2ZkYS1zdWJtaXNzaW9uL2FydGljbGUvMTUzMDA3MzEvbmF0ZXJhLWZpbGVzLXByZXN1Ym1pc3Npb24td2l0aC1mZGEtZm9yLW5pcHQtdGVzdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Natera files presubmission with FDA for NIPT test,"Natera has proactively filed a presubmission with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as part of the Q-Sub process for the firm’s Panorama noninvasive prenatal test (NIPT) to detect fetal chromosomal aneuploidies and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.

Computational chemistry is a scientific field that uses computer simulations to help solve chemical problems. A related field is computational biology which uses similar techniques to answer complex questions about biology. Add in machine learning algorithms and scientists can now largely automate the process of identifying druggable disease targets and potential therapies before doing the more laborious and costly work of synthesizing small molecule drugs and conducting clinical trials.

We’ve written quite a bit about AI healthcare and the many companies using AI for drug discovery. More recently we’ve focused on four AI drug discovery stocks available to investors and liked the business model of one company enough that we added it to our Nanalyze Disruptive Tech Portfolio. Somehow we missed a fifth AI drug discovery company that went public through a traditional IPO in July 2020 called Relay Therapeutics (RLAY). While we briefly profiled Relay Therapeutics in 2019 in our piece on computational technologies and drug discovery it’s time to take a deep dive and see if we picked the right company for our portfolio.

About Relay Therapeutics Stock

Relay was founded in 2016 by four scientists including Dr. David E. Shaw a billionaire former hedge fund manager who pioneered the use of algorithms for securities trading. Today Dr. Shaw holds a couple of different appointments at Columbia University and is also chief scientist of D.E. Shaw Research which uses specially built supercomputers for drug discovery.

The rest of the team are hardly slackers themselves. Dr. Dorothee Kern is a professor of biochemistry at Brandeis University who also co-founded MOMA Therapeutics another Cambridge Massachusetts company focused on drug discovery using many of the same techniques as Relay Therapeutics. Dr. Matthew Jacobson is also an academic and entrepreneur whose company Global Blood Therapeutics (GBT) is reportedly the target of a $5 billion acquisition by Pfizer for its sickle cell therapeutics. Jacobson also sits on the board of Schrödinger (SDGR) a computational chemistry company that leans heavily on machine learning for developing drugs. It also went public in 2020. Last but certainly not least is Dr. Mark Murcko out of MIT who has helped shepherd nine drugs to market including two for the treatment of HIV while at Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) a biotech worth more than $70 billion.

Some equally quality names are attached to Relay’s investor list including Google’s venture capital arm and the SoftBank Vision Fund. D.E. Shaw Research is both an investor and partner (more on that shortly). Altogether the company had raised $520 million as a startup before an upsized IPO in July 2020 netted the company about $425 million. Last year Relay issued a secondary offering of stock at a price of $26.50 and hauled in another $382 million and change. Today the company sits on a market cap of $2.15 billion with Relay Therapeutics stock trading close to its original IPO price of $20 from two years ago. That’s despite the fact that the company has yet to bring a drug to market or realize significant revenue outside of one big pharma deal (also more on that shortly).

Relay Therapeutics Platform

All of this begs the question: What is the Relay Therapeutics platform and how does it work? Most drug development is focused on proteins the molecular machines behind most biological processes. Conventional approaches rely on analyzing static images of protein fragments to provide insights on druggable targets. In contrast Relay Therapeutics studies the three-dimensional motion of proteins using genomic data computational biology and machine learning. The company has termed and trademarked the approach as Motion-Based Drug Design which it claims results in medicines with greater specificity and potency by analyzing the way proteins change shape and how a particular shape influences disease.

The platform itself is called Dynamo also trademarked. It employs new experimental techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy or Cryo-EM which won the 2017 Nobel prize in chemistry by revealing high-resolution information about the structure of biomolecules. Combined with techniques like molecular dynamics and machine learning Dynamo can reputedly speed up the drug discovery process.

The process breaks down into three key phases:

Develop a mechanistic understanding of the dynamic behavior of a target protein and identify areas where a small molecule drug could potentially have an effect.

Dynamo then identifies chemical starting points through a system of experimental and virtual screens rapidly developing and prioritizing possibly drug candidates.

Machine learning models do what they do best: repeat and rinse so the process continuously improves the understanding of protein motion.

In April 2021 Relay reinforced its platform with the $85 million acquisition of ZebiAI Therapeutics a biotech that applies massive experimental DNA-encoded library datasets to power machine learning for drug discovery.

Relay Therapeutics Pipeline and Partnerships

So far Relay has churned out three lead product candidates all focused on cancer and all in early clinical stages of testing. Its most advanced drug dubbed RLY-4008 targets a protein called FGFR2 that is often mutated in cancers. RLY-2608 is going after breast cancer. And RLY-1971 is being developed to inhibit a type of metastatic tumor in collaboration with Genentech a venerable biotech firm that became a subsidiary of Roche back in 2009 for nearly $47 billion. The Genentech deal represents the only revenue that Relay has generated to date – about $95 million in upfront and milestone payments.

As we noted earlier co-founder Shaw’s computational biochemistry research firm is a key collaborator. Relay relies on the firm’s Anton 2 supercomputer as well as its proprietary algorithms and software for computational modeling capabilities focused on analyzing protein motion. In other words D.E. Shaw Research provides key technologies that make Dynamo dynamic.

Should You Buy Relay Therapeutics Stock?

We recently profiled another AI drug discovery company Exscientia (EXAI) which has a much more robust pipeline and portfolio of partnerships than Relay Therapeutics. But we wouldn’t invest in Exscientia because of its inconsistent revenues. In addition its drug discovery platform remains unproven until the company can successfully bring a drug to market – a prospect that is years away from fruition. The same concerns apply to Relay Therapeutics stock. Moreover Relay has only one major pharma deal versus at least three for Exscientia. We’re also concerned about the company’s reliance on Shaw’s research firm for key parts of its platform. Big-name scientists also have big egos and Relay wouldn’t be the first company hobbled by infighting among its founders each of whom has plenty of distractions with their other businesses and jobs.

Relay Therapeutics had about $838 million in its war chest which the company claims is enough to keep the lights on into at least 2025. There’s no way any of its current drug candidates will be marketable by then. Where will the additional money come from to reach the finish line? Well the Genentech deal is potentially worth up to $695 million if Relay opts to forego the profit/cost share model but that’s a lot of milestones to trigger. Perhaps it can attract more customers to pay to use its platform similar to Exscientia. The more likely scenario is yet another public offering that might dilute shareholder value. Relay Therapeutics stock is already 55% off of its high in 2020 compared to a 25% return on the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) a popular exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index. The way things are looking now we can expect more of the same well into the future.

Conclusion

AI drug discovery is one of the most exciting technologies today illustrating the game-changing potential for machine-learning algorithms to help us stave off disease and live longer. But there’s a huge gap between potential and profit. Even the best of the bunch Schrödinger is struggling to grow revenues despite using a sort of hybrid software-as-a–service (SaaS) business model where customers license its drug discovery capabilities on an annual basis.

We’d like to see Relay Therapeutics and the rest of the AI drug discovery companies figure out a way to establish more consistent revenue streams. They may be developing new therapies in nontraditional ways but they’re still relying on staid business models that have seen many a biotech flame out over time.

More than a year after announcing a deal to acquire the Tropicana Las Vegas Bally’s Corp. said it will close the $308 million transaction at the end of September.

However executives from the Rhode Island-based company said last week it will be well into 2023 before any redevelopment takes place on the 34-acre south-Strip location.

That schedule may not fit in the timeline of the Oakland A’s. The Major League Baseball team has reportedly targeted the Tropicana location as a site for a $1 billion 35000-seat stadium should the A’s choose to relocate to Las Vegas.

“I think it's well-advertised that we intend to develop (the site) at some point in the future” Bally’s CEO Lee Fenton said in the company’s second-quarter earnings conference call last week. “But we will run the property on an as-is basis at least for the next 12 months until we have identified the plan and the partnerships that we want going forward.”

A’s executives have said they would like to have a decision on a new home this year. The team wants to build a $1 billion waterfront ballpark in Oakland to replace the 57-year-old RingCentral Coliseum. The proposed stadium is the centerpiece of a projected $12 billion mixed-use development at the Port of Oakland’s Howard Terminal.

However numerous approvals from Bay Area elected leaders are still required and the team is on “parallel paths” toward landing a new ballpark in Oakland or moving to Las Vegas. The Tropicana is one of two sites in the resort corridor the team is exploring for a ballpark. Reportedly a 27-acre parcel owned by VICI Properties along Koval Lane behind Planet Hollywood and Paris Las Vegas is also under consideration.

Bally’s first announced the acquisition of the Tropicana in April 2021 as part of the $308 million deal with real estate investment trust Gaming and Leisure Properties which owns the site. Bally’s said it would pay GLPI $10.5 million annually to lease the site under a 50-year rental that is subject to increases.

GLPI General Counsel Brandon Moore said a week earlier the company was aware Bally’s is looking at redeveloping the Tropicana site and “obviously (has) a strong interest in the ultimate plans.”

Bally’s purchase of the nearly 1500-room Rat Pack-era property still needs approval by Nevada gaming regulators. The matter is currently not scheduled to be heard on this month’s agenda.

It is thought that the company would rename the resort under the Bally’s brand as it has done with 13 of its 14 casinos including its Evansville Indiana property that was formerly known as Tropicana Evansville.

Caesars Entertainment is converting Bally’s Las Vegas into Horseshoe Las Vegas. Caesars also owns Tropicana Atlantic City but has not announced any plans to rebrand that property.

Bally’s CFO Bobby Lavan said the Tropicana Las Vegas would initially produce $6 million in quarterly cash flow once the company takes over operations. Penn Entertainment has owned the Tropicana since 2015 but sold the real estate and resort facility to GLPI in March 2020 during the pandemic.

Analysts didn’t have much commentary on the Tropicana deal directing attention toward Bally’s interactive gaming division and the company’s planned casino in Chicago.

Bally’s said it would spend $70 million to open a temporary casino by next June while constructing the $1.7 billion permanent hotel-casino at the former Chicago Tribune site downtown along the Chicago River. The resort is expected to open in 2026.

Golden evaluating plans for shuttered Colorado Belle in Laughlin

Golden Entertainment is maintaining its gaming license for the Colorado Belle Casino Hotel in Laughlin that has been closed for 29 months but the company is evaluating plans for the riverboat-themed property.

Las Vegas-based Golden currently operates two casino-hotels in the Colorado River gaming community the 1900-room Aquarius and the 1052-room Edgewater. The nearly 1200-room Colorado Belle is adjacent to the Edgewater.

""That is a one-of-a-kind piece of property on the riverfront and has a multitude of potential uses” Golden CEO Blake Sartini said last week on the company’s second-quarter earnings conference call. “I won't get into what we've explored.”

The Colorado Belle is the largest of the five casino hotels in Southern Nevada that have not reopened since the pandemic caused a 78-day shutdown of gaming in 2020.

Last month Red Rock Resorts said it would demolish its three closed properties — Fiesta Rancho and Texas Station in North Las Vegas and Fiesta Henderson — and then clear the sites and sell the land without the gaming entitlements.

Boyd Gaming has no plans to reopen nor demolish its Eastside Cannery property on the Boulder Highway. The company said customer demand in the market is not strong enough to handle another casino. Boyd also operates Sam’s Town in close proximity to the Cannery.

Sartini made similar comments about Golden’s presence in the Laughlin market.

“I think the capacity that we currently have with the rooms and the casino inventory is sufficient for what we see going forward down there” Sartini said. “That market at some point could use a significant traffic driver.""

Laughlin which was one of two markets in the state that didn’t set a gaming revenue record in 2021 has more than 8600 hotel rooms. The community 90 miles from Las Vegas and across the Colorado River from Bullhead City Arizona has seen 624500 visitors through June according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority a less than 1 percent decline from 2021.

Golden operates the Laughlin Events Center which has an active performance schedule.

Without Colorado Belle Golden and Caesars Entertainment are essentially tied as Laughlin’s largest casino operators. Caesars has the 1500-room Harrah’s Laughlin and the 1450-room Tropicana Laughlin.

Even as Colorado Belle remains idled Golden is looking at acquisition opportunities including slot machine routes in markets outside of Nevada where it is the largest operator of gaming in taverns bars and other third-party locations.

Deutsche Bank gaming analyst Carlo Santarelli suggested Golden would look at casino opportunities in Nevada given the company’s presence in Las Vegas Laughlin and Pahrump.

“Buy-side mergers and acquisition opportunities would be more of a (casino) recycling effort in which Golden would be likely to dispose of a non-core (casino) or (casinos) prior to an acquisition” he wrote in a research note following the conference call.

Quotable

Via The Associated Press

Hard Rock Atlantic City President Joe Lupo is headed to Las Vegas later this year to run The Mirage once Hard Rock Entertainment takes ownership of the Strip resort. The company is buying the property for roughly $1.1 billion. Lupo worked in Southern Nevada for several Boyd Gaming properties including the former Stardust. He went to Atlantic City when Boyd owned the Borgata.

“The last four years in Atlantic City have been such a rewarding experience for me. I feel humbled and excited to be appointed as the new president of the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Las Vegas project and to return home to my family.”

Operators of the Sapphire gentleman’s club are seeking Clark County approval for a dozen bar-top slot machines which would violate ordinances against having gaming in an adult nightclub and topless lounge. Gaming industry leaders are supportive because Sapphires is across from entrances to Resorts World Las Vegas and next to Thrive Cannabis Marketplace a dispensary that has applied for a marijuana consumption license.

“I would suggest that this is premature to consider adding another entitlement in this location until you know how the previously approved entitlements are going to perform.”

As part of its second-quarter earnings release Penn National Gaming said it is renaming the company Penn Entertainment which reflects its multifaceted operations including 44 casinos in 20 states sports betting and online casino gaming.

“Our new name maintains ties to our legacy while better reflecting our evolution into North America’s leading provider of integrated entertainment sports content and casino gaming experiences.”

Via MGM Resorts International Second-Quarter Conference call

MGM Resorts owns 50 percent of its BetMGM digital gaming operation. The company tried last year to acquire the remaining 50 percent from its partner European gaming operator Entain Plc but the offer was rejected as “too low.” UBS gaming analyst Robin Farley asked whether MGM still wanted 100 percent ownership of BetMGM.

“We think about it all the time. It would be foolish to think otherwise. And you can't buy what's not for sale. We remain keenly focused on BetMGM. We'd like more of it. … We continue to follow the math and we understand it intimately. But for now we have no story there.”

Sheila Carter became quite a strange snack for a very hungry bear.

B&B Spoilers Recap Highlights

Steffy Forrester Finnegan (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood) barely had time to enjoy a morning with her husband before his mother showed up. Then she hardly had time to get mad about it before she Dr. John ‘Finn’ Finnegan and Li Finnegan (Naomi Matsuda) had to run to the office. Detective Sanchez (Jeremy Ray Valdez) had an update about Sheila (Kimberlin Brown).

READ THIS: Find out what’s happening next on The Bold and the Beautiful.

The Finnegans met up with Brooke Logan Forrester (Katherine Kelly Lane) in the main office and were met by Eric Forrester (John McCook) and Taylor Hayes (Krista Allen). Unfortunately no one could find Ridge Forrester (Thorsten Kaye) since Brooke had his phone.

B&B Recap: Sheila Has One Toe In The Grave

The detective then told the family a most shocking tale. They traced Sheila out of town via a gas station camera. They were hot on her trail and were sure they were closing in. Sadly they didn’t get to make an arrest. Not-so sadly she’s dead.

As the story goes Sheila was met by an angry bear while camping out. She was viciously attacked — so badly all that was left was a whole lot of blood hair and a toe. Yes a toe. A very gnarly toe no one can unsee.

Is this really real or just another one of Sheila’s tricks? The detective assured them the DNA was a perfect match. And once they saw the toe they were convinced. Everyone in Los Angeles knows no one would ever dare keep living without their middle toe.

The Bold and the Beautiful Recap: Little Man Big Feelings

Over at the cabin Thomas Forrester (Matthew Atkinson) had an emotional visit with his son. Douglas Forrester (Django Ferri). They had fun playing catch but once the game was over Douglas brought up some big feelings. He missed his dad. Did Thomas miss him too?

This prompted Thomas to have a very big discussion with Hope Logan Spencer (Annika Noelle) and Liam Spencer (Scott Clifton). He was moving back into the Forrester mansion and he wanted Douglas to move with him. It’s time. Hope nearly cried as she tabled the discussion.

He was 93.

His son David confirmed the death.

The credit card business was in an early rocky stage of development in 1967 when Mr. Hock was named to run the credit card department of National Bank of Commerce in Seattle which was licensed by Bank of America to issue its BankAmericard.

At the time the business was beset by bad debts and fraud and the cards themselves were primitive: They lacked the magnetic stripes that would later encode customer information; transactions that required bank authorizations took a long time; and the embossed information on them — customer name card number expiration date — was awkwardly copied onto receipts with a heavy imprinter.

“By 1968 I was extremely concerned that the industry may go under and our bank’s investment with it” Mr. Hock told Plazm an arts and politics magazine based in Portland Ore. in 2013. “I was attending a meeting of all of the licensees of BofA which soon became a shambles of argument and accusations.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA4LTExL2VzdG9uaWEtdGlnaHRlbnMtcnVzc2lhbi12aXNhLXJ1bGVzLWFzLXNjaG9sei1za2VwdGljYWwtb2YtYmFu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Estonia Tightens Russian Visa Rules as Scholz Skeptical of Ban,"Why did this happen?

BELIZE CITY Mon. Aug. 8 2022 Aquatic ecologist Dr. Ed Boles has drafted a 31-page document sounding the alarm on a potential threat to the environment that could affect the Jewel for generations to come – the proposal of Vulcan Materials Company the largest construction aggregate firm in the US to set up shop in Belize and mine limestone from a mineral formation located at the White Ridge Farm a private property near Gales Point Manatee in the Stann Creek District.



The company has expressed an interest in purchasing the property but has not finalized the acquisition according to recent reports. They are however now seeking an audience with government officials and the people of Gales Point a large number of whom have passionately opposed the project which they believe could disrupt their way of life.

In a recent interview Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Natural Resources Petroleum and Mining Hon. Cordel Hyde told local media that the company’s proposal is a “no- go”.

“The residents from Gales Point Manatee have made it absolutely clear to the government that they don’t want that kind of activity in their neck of the woods absolutely clear for the longest time—at least I can remember since we’ve been in government and I can imagine it even from before they’ve been clamoring and making that statement and if we’re a government of the people by the people for the people then we have to listen to our people so that’s a no-go for us really” Hon. Hyde told local media.

We’ve been informed that the company is seeking environmental clearance for mining operations that according to Boles could potentially disrupt local hydrological systems in the Southern Lagoon and threaten flora and fauna in the area. This Alabama-based company has been in a long-standing dispute with the Mexican government over its method of extracting limestone—methods that President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador says amount to “ecological catastrophe.”

They have since been ordered to stop their mining operation in two locations in Quintana Roo Mexico and have subsequently brought a lawsuit against the Mexican government for $1.5 billion. (We understand that this is just one of a number of lawsuits the company has brought against the Mexican government.)

The company which is operating in Belize under the name “The White Ridge Project” has said that they are in the process of exploring the geologic and economic feasibility of embarking on a mining operation in Belize. But by all indications it seems that they already have their sights set on the Sugar Hill limestone formation located at the White Ridge Farm. Reports are that the company has been operating in Belize under the name Caracol Holdings Limited and received an exploration license as far back as 2019 to search for limestone in the country. They are now planning a trip to Belize during which they plan to conduct information sessions seemingly geared at securing the buy- in of the residents of Gales Point a community already affected by and battling the effects of erosion.

Despite DPM Hyde’s apparent stance in support of the community’s opposition to the proposed mining operation the company’s VP of External Affairs and Corporate Communication Janet Kavinoky says the company wants to start a dialogue. They are looking for an opportunity to convince the government and the community that their project is environmentally and socially feasible.

“There is a process by which Belize and the government offer companies to go through where we say we want to go through that process. We want to ask and answer any question. We want people in the community people with interest to ask and answer questions.” Kavinoky told 7News’ Jules Vasquez in a recent interview.

The company has a long history of contentious litigation over its operation within areas of the United States and now in Mexico. Boles fears that Belize could fall into its corporate web and be subject to destructive practices and lawsuits of crippling proportions if the company is allowed to operate within the country.

Among some of the glaring environmental concerns listed in the study is the fact that the company intends to blast and pulverize the limestone material and use a conveyer bridge to carry the material to waiting cargo ships in a dredged-out center on the inner channel behind the Barrier Reef. This would involve transporting such material over both land and sea. His study says that the government has banned strip mining in the area but the company wants to push forward and get environmental clearance to start work in Belize.

“Belize has increased in importance to Vulcan because the Mexican Government shut down the Calica

Mine on May 5 2022 due to the extensive amount of environmental damage the mining operation was causing. In response Vulcan has a lawsuit against the Mexican Government for $1.5 billion USD and the International Center for Investment Disputes shall be issuing a decision” Dr. Boles stated.

As mentioned the Mexican government cited concerns over the impact of limestone extraction on the local environment and water table and called Vulcan’s method “destructive”. “What is very clear is that we’re not permitting any more extraction of the material” President Obrador Lopez said in a press conference in late May and he added that the operations will remain suspended until the parties agree on what to do with the site.

The US-based company has operated through the Calica unit in Mexico and has several concessions in Quintana Roo that have enabled it to crush limestone in mines in that area and ship it to the United States. The area which occupies around 10400 acres resembles a wasteland and the Mexican president has threatened to submit a complaint to the United Nations about the destruction of the area but later toned down his remarks.

The company’s website for the White Ridge Project says that they are looking into creating an “environmentally and socially sustainable limestone quarry” but Boles’s report highlights for example that methods such as strip mining— which involves removing the top foliage and soil of an area to expose the limestone deposit–are the most commonly used and oftentimes cause permanent destruction. This method renders the area a wasteland before making pockets of sinkholes from which the limestone is extracted. Kavinoky has since said that the company does not intend to carry out a strip mining operation but will instead do aggregate quarrying.

In terms of how limestone mining can affect ground water the report states “Limestone mining has significant effects on groundwater resources through the removal of the aquifer deposit or a large part of that deposit. As limestone mining progresses there is less water storage space available the intricate structure of the aquifer is destroyed and eventually the water table is left exposed becoming a surface water body.”

Boles is calling on Belizeans to urge the government to not sign any agreement with the company known for its strong-arm legal approach and destructive practices.

“I think that this would probably hurt our reputation in the world as a country that is putting our natural resources on high priority. Allowing these kinds of development to come into the country is really counter to many of the projects that have been done so far to conserve those resources” he said.

Dr. Boles added “We can’t replace the ecological services that ecosystems provide us and that includes all of the organisms living in the ecosystem that are providing the nurturant and other resources that keep life viable on earth and a healthy civilization requires a healthy ecosystem. I think that there is growing support amount Belizeans to not accept these kinds of development schemes…I think we are beginning to understand that we need to be very careful of the kinds of development that we engage with and select those development strategies that best fit our small country that focus on conserving the incredibly rich natural resources that we have those resources that really define us. “

After walking the picket lines for seven weeks 300 members of the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 150 voted unanimously to adopt their new contract. Among the contract improvements IUOE members won from their strike are a minimum wage increase of 16% throughout the life of the three year contract stronger layoff language stronger seniority language and 100% employer paid healthcare. The contract victory was achieved through immense struggle and unwavering solidarity between IUOE members the local labor movement and the broader Chicago community.

On June 7 300 IUOE members walked off the job to protest unresolved Unfair Labor Practices that the union filed against the three employers it was bargaining with — Lehigh Hanson Vulcan Materials and Lafarge Holcim. The three companies who organize themselves into the Chicago Area Aggregate Producers Association sell sand gravel and crushed stone that IUOE members produce and work with. These materials are needed for asphalt concrete and other construction materials. The ULPs that the union filed sought to resolve management’s contract violations and their infringement on union members’ rights including their right to hold union meetings.

IUOE Local 150 members did not take the decision to strike lightly. According to IUOE Communications Director Ed Maher “Over the course of the pandemic the attitude of many of these employers changed. It went from partnership to adversarial. These are large global corporations so I don’t know what exactly is behind that but our members go to work everyday and put in a hard day’s work. They expect to be treated with respect and that the terms of the collective bargaining agreement will be abided by.”

Almost a month in the strike began to make major impacts in Chicago area construction projects. According to an article published in the Chicago Sun Times on July 4 the walkout was causing disruptions in several construction projects and some were under threat of being canceled.

Instead of deciding to bargain with the union in good faith the three employers decided to try to break the strike. “They brought in replacement workers right away. Whether it was supervisors or employees of the company that did administrative tasks in the office they trained them to operate heavy equipment. They also brought in workers from other parts of the country to do our work. They told employees that what we were asking for in negotiations was exorbitant. That they were welcome to come back to work any time and cross the picket line. There was a lot of dishonesty in what our members were told by these companies. Positions we took during negotiations were fabricated and misrepresented” Maher told Liberation News.

Maher noted that daily communication from IUOE Local 150 was critical to overcoming the employer’s divide and conquer tactics. “The members came to us to ask what was going on and we kept them informed on what was going on on a daily basis. We provided them with concrete information to show them what they were being told by the employer wasn’t true.”

Because of the union’s consistent communication and the member’s clear understanding of what they were fighting for 78% of IUOE members voted down CAAPA’s initial final offer. “The employers knew what the priorities of these workers were. One of them was to amend contract language that impacted the way member’s benefits were paid on an hourly basis. There was a limit to which hours the employers would pay benefits on and the members wanted to change that language. They gave us a final offer that did not include those changes. That offer was voted down” Maher explained. “Once it was voted down it was a matter of hours before the companies reached out to talk about figuring this out. Forty-eight hours later the members approved a Tentative Agreement. After seven weeks of trying to introduce questions into these worker’s minds and trying to split them and they are still voting their offer down they saw the membership was not in danger of cracking and they got serious.”

Maher highlighted the impact that solidarity from other unions and the Chicago community had in winning the strike. “We were very grateful to other union members in the pits. It’s not just operators. It’s Laborers Teamsters and Machinists. When our members went out the Laborers went out. The Teamsters went out. What we saw was that solidarity works. If half the members crossed the picket lines and went back to work the strike would not have been successful. But none of our members crossed the picket lines. They understood what they were fighting for. At the end they were offered less. They said no. And they got what they wanted” Maher said.

“Every worker needs to realize they have a lot more power than they think. If they stand together and fight together they can win. You can always do more when you fight together.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0YXRlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2FydGljbGUyNjMzNTczOTguaHRtbNIBOWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZXN0YXRlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2FydGljbGUyNjMzNTczOTguaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Could an earthquake break the Lake Murray dam?

The event at 6:30 p.m. Friday Aug. 19 takes place a day before the Woodward Dream Cruise and attracts classic car owners and enthusiasts.

One of the roughly 300 classic car owners signed up to take part in the parade again is resident Greg Reid proud owner of a 1965 Ford Galaxy convertible and a licensed reproduction 1965 Shelby Cobra.

“I enjoy the older cars and I graduated from high school in 1965” said Reid who often drives one of the dignitaries in the parade. “It takes me back when I can load friends into the Galaxy and go up and down Woodward.”

Like other classic car owners from the cruising era Reid likes to be able to work on his own cars and eschews the high-tech style of modern cars.

“The (old) cars are better” he said. “It’s fuel spark and air – it’s not the computer.”

Berkley closes 12 Mile Road for the parade which runs west from Roseland Park Cemetery at Woodward Avenue to Greenfield Road.

The city’s Parks and Recreation Department works with the local CruiseFest Committee for the event which started 26 years ago a year after the Dream Cruise began.

Even since then Berkley’s event draws from 15000 to 20000 people to town to see the classic cars and attend an after-party and entertainment.

This year Denise Davis and the Motor City Sensations will perform their music along the south end of Robina Avenue.

There is also an outdoor movie “Back to the Future” and a face painting booth along with food trucks and a kids zone.

Beneath the Berkley marquee on 12 Mile a prime viewing spot for the parade the Berkley Chamber of Commerce will sell the official 2022 CruiseFest T-shirts at their table.

“This is one of the biggest events we work on” said Theresa McArleton director of the parks and recreation department which registers cars for the parade.

The event production is a collaboration between community groups and city departments.

CruiseFest also raises money for nonprofit groups in the city.

Berkley buys official Woodward Dream Cruise merchandise which is sold during CruiseFest and the Dream Cruise McArleton said.

Groups such as Friends of Berkley Parks and Recreation Youth Assistance Berkley Junior Women’s Club Berkley Hoops High School Boosters and Berkley Days Association take part.

“The community groups sell the Dream Cruise merchandise and the proceeds are split between the groups and the city” McArleton said.

Reid a 44-year resident of the city will continue to drive his classic cars in the parade as long as he can.

“When I can’t do it any more I’ll be disappointed” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50YXVudG9uZ2F6ZXR0ZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC8yMDIyLzA4LzIxL3RhdW50b24tc3RvcC1zdG9yaWVzLW5hbmN5LXF1aWxsLWpvZS1udWdlbnQtY2FycmllLWNvbnNhbHZpLWVtdS83ODQ2MjAwMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Taunton stop stories: Nancy Quill Joe Nugent Carrie Consalvi emu,"Before we begin the new week in earnest we're taking a look back at the week that was and the stories that led the news with Taunton Daily Gazette readers.

“Miss Aldridge Regrets” by Louise Hare (Berkley)

Jazz Singer Lena Aldridge has just seen her boss murdered in the London dive where she works. So she jumps at the chance when out of the blue an American producer offers her a job starring in a Broadway play. The offer includes a first-class ticket on the Queen Mary.

It sounds too good to be true and of course it is.

On the ship Aldridge finds herself assigned to a table with a wealthy New York family. Only the conductor of a jazz band realizes the fair-skinned Lena is half Black. Things start to go wrong when the patriarch of the American family is murdered and Aldridge realizes she’s been dining with a killer. But who? And why?

Aldridge is a flawed but appealing character as she tries to figure out why she is entangled in a web of murder and deceit.

“The Locked Room” by Elly Griffiths (Mariner Books)

It probably isn’t a good idea to start a mystery series with Book 14. After all the author expects you to know something about the characters. Still “The Locked Room” is a good mystery even if you haven’t met the characters before.

Ruth Galloway author Griffiths’ sleuth discovers a photograph among her deceased mother’s things that shows Galloway’s cottage in Norfolk. The funny thing is that written on the picture is “dawn 1963.” That’s not only long before Ruth bought the house but also a few years before she was born.

Galloway and her daughter Kate are stuck in the cottage when COVID hits. So they’re delighted when a new neighbor moves in next door. Zoe a nurse is friendly — maybe too friendly. Galloway is more concerned with the rash of suicides that might not really be suicides that come close to home. Nelson Kate’s father is the investigator in charge.

I guess if you’ve read the other 13 mysteries you know all about the relationship between Ruth Kate Nelson and Nelson’s wife. But it may be a bit of a conundrum to a new reader.

“Overboard” by Sara Paretsky (William Morrow)

While Ruth Galloway is a new friend V.I. Warshawski and I go way back. I’ve watched her solve some two dozen mysteries.

In “Overboard” Vic is out with Mitch and Peppy when the dogs discover a young girl lying in a pile of construction debris. Vic calls the cops who whisk away the teen to her old friend Dr. Lotty’s hospital. The girl Julia disappears after being interviewed by a fake cop. Then the hospital roommate is murdered.

Meanwhile Vic discovers Julia is the granddaughter of a wealthy woman living in a mansion in an industrial area ripe for development. But the woman has been placed in a memory-care facility by her son Julia’s uncle.

At the same time Brad the son of one of V.I.’s adversaries from the old neighborhood asks Vic to find out why his father’s in trouble.

Of course the two mysteries are related. Vic finds herself hiding two teens while solving two crimes — three actually because Vic’s trying to help the aging members of a Jewish synagogue in danger of losing their building.

It’s all very complicated but knowing Vic as I do I’m pretty sure she can handle it.

“In the Dark We Forget” by Sandra SG Wong (HarperCollins)

How terrifying to wake up drugged and lying on the side of the road and not know who you are or why you’re there. Maybe whoever left you is out to kill you.

That’s what happens to Cleopatra Li whose amnesia is total. She’s found by a stripper on her way home from work then taken to a police station. Police eventually find who she is but the identification is equally traumatic. Li’s parents who were staying at a nearby lodge are missing and when her brother arrives to claim Li he tells her that their mother has just won a $47 million lottery. Nice motive for murder.

As Li tries to recover her memory she learns she was a highly successful executive fired because she was so difficult to work with. Moreover her mother dominated her. She and her parents lived on either side of a duplex which her mother has just sold. Now Li is jobless and will be homeless in a couple of weeks. Soon it’s revealed that that was all a plan by her mother to force Li to move to California with her parents to take care of them.

How does Li prove her innocence when she can’t remember? Maybe she’s guilty after all. Or could it be the father or mother or the brother Cass who seems so supportive.

Along with being intriguing “In the Dark We Forget” is infused with Chinese culture and the obligations of a Chinese daughter.

He spent a good chunk of it baking bread he says which kick-started the idea for his new-ish sandwich shop in the Mission Chuck’s Takeaway where the chef and his team bake thin-crusted Vietnamese baguettes soft milk bread and sourdough boules as bases for their hand-held meals.

But baking wasn’t the chef’s only pandemic obsession. He also spent time diving deep into all things rice-related reading up on heirloom varieties the history of the agricultural product and our ability to grow it sustainably in the future. Now he’s channeling all that knowledge into a new menu for his Berkley restaurant Rice & Bones housed inside concrete icon Wurster Hall on the University of California Berkeley campus.

On August 16 Phan will introduce Rice & Bones 2.0 (as he and the team playfully call it) with a menu of rotating rice trays. On any given day the trays will showcase five or so different types of rice everything from basmati and Jasmine to broken rice and brown. The pairings will be set with each option including rice a protein and a side of seasonal vegetables — all served in separate bowls. “I just like that style of eating” Phan says noting that he doesn’t like his food to touch (same chef). “I want to be in control.”

As always Phan and the team are committed to quality making what they can from scratch. For example the menu includes a preserved Meyer lemon chicken made using lemons Phan preserved more than a year ago. It’s served alongside a bowl of nutty long-grain basmati rice while lemongrass roasted pork comes with a side of couscous-like broken rice. Other protein options could include braised pork belly with young coconut mapo tofu with mushroom and pressed cabbage and beef curry with carrots and potatoes. The exact lineup will change throughout the year but Phan says more vegetarian options are in the works.

And fans of Rice & Bones' existing menu don’t need to worry about losing some of the most popular items. The restaurant will also continue to serve three kinds of pho including chicken and beef pho plus a vegan version made with Hodo tofu. For breakfast expect BBQ pork chicken and shiitake and veggie steam buns; zongzi or sticky rice with shiitake and king trumpet mushrooms tofu and jicama in lotus leaf; chicken salad; and spring rolls.

Phan who attended architecture school at UC Berkeley inside the famously unattractive building Rice & Bones calls home says the location has been challenging especially during the past two years. Without students on campus summers tend to be slow but during the busy school year lines can stretch long. Phan hopes this new menu format will fit both seasons and appeal to the broader community. “The goal was really just to make good food and feed people” Phan says.

Rice & Bones (Wurster Hall College Of Environmental Design at University of California Berkeley) is open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. The new menu launches on Tuesday August 16 and online ordering will be available on the Rice & Bones website.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL2ZhbGxyaXZlcnJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9kYS1xdWlubi1leHBhbmRpbmctY29sZC1jYXNlLXVuaXQtdG8tcmV2aWV3LWJyaXN0b2wtY291bnR5LW1pc3NpbmctcGVyc29ucy1jYXNlcy1mcm9tLXRoZS1wYXN0LWZpdmUtZGVjYWRlcy_SAYoBaHR0cHM6Ly9mYWxscml2ZXJyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vZGEtcXVpbm4tZXhwYW5kaW5nLWNvbGQtY2FzZS11bml0LXRvLXJldmlldy1icmlzdG9sLWNvdW50eS1taXNzaW5nLXBlcnNvbnMtY2FzZXMtZnJvbS10aGUtcGFzdC1maXZlLWRlY2FkZXMv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DA Quinn expanding Cold Case Unit to review Bristol County missing persons cases from the past five decades,"Bristol County District Attorney Tom Quinn’s Cold Case Unit announced today that it is further expanding its scope to include a group of “Missing Persons” who have vanished without a trace during the past 50 years.

The Cold Case Unit is actively reviewing missing person cases in conjunction with its efforts to identify all unidentified bodies another initiative that was announced earlier this summer. “Many individuals have been missing for many years without any details of what happened to them. Although there are many circumstances where individuals go missing where no criminal circumstances are involved it is important that any individual can be accounted for to rule out concerns by law enforcement authorities and provide answers to family members.”

District Attorney Quinn’s Cold Case Unit has been very successful in bringing charges in homicide and violent sexual assaults cases dating back more than 30 years. Most recently District Attorney Quinn announced the indictment of David Reed for the 2001 cold case homicide of his half-sister Rose Marie Moniz in New Bedford. The indictment was returned as a result of an extensive re-examination of evidence in the case by District Attorney Quinn’s Cold Case Unit. And just last year the Cold Case Unit secured a conviction against serial rapist Ivan Keith who brutally accosted assaulted and raped at least four women during the 1990s. In early 2019 the Cold Case Unit reviewed the series rapes in an attempt to develop new leads that might lead to the identification of the person responsible for these heinous crimes which we believed were connected. Recognizing that no identification had been made in the more than 20 years since the crimes occurred investigators explored new technologies that combined the available DNA evidence with genetic genealogy. As a result of their extensive investigation Keith was identified as the chief suspect in a series of cold case rapes was tracked down to Maine and was apprehended. He is now spending the rest of his life in state prison. The Cold Case Unit has also solved several other cold case homicides and rapes from throughout Bristol County.

The use of the latest forensic technologies involving DNA and genetic genealogy has provided investigators with additional tools to assist in their new Missing Persons Project and previously announced Unidentified Bodies Project. Ongoing efforts are being undertaken to not only identify unidentified bodies but also to develop a DNA profile for missing persons so that it can be used even many years later to assist in identifying a missing person.

“Finding missing persons and unidentified bodies is part of our ongoing Cold Case initiative. We are trying to locate each and every one of these missing persons in order to bring some closure to families and friends who have been searching for their loved ones for years. It is also likely that in some of these cases people have gone missing as a result of foul play and criminal conduct. At the heart of our mission is bringing justice to victims. That is why we are now expanding our ‘cold case’ efforts into new frontiers” District Attorney Quinn said. “Our Cold Case Unit has been successful in solving multiple cold case homicides and previously unsolved violent sexual assaults. The unit is now expanding its efforts to focus on missing persons and unidentified remains. If anyone has any information related to these cases please contact us.”

District Attorney Quinn has prioritized this initiative along with the Cold Case Unit’s efforts on unsolved murders rapes and other violent crimes. The Cold Case Unit is working with the local police Massachusetts State Police Unresolved Unit and other law enforcement partners to provide the latest technology and forensic testing to identify unidentified bodies and human remains found in Bristol County some of whom are homicide victims. The District Attorney’s Office has enlisted the help of nationally recognized agencies and labs who specialize in using the most modern forensic technologies for identification of human remains including genetic genealogical DNA testing. These agencies include the FBI NamUs the University of North Texas for Human Identification The Doe Project Season of Justice and Othram laboratories whose expertise and resources bring hope that these individuals can finally be identified.

UK: Porterbrook will be the first UK rail customer to use a Transit Performance Optimisation Centre which Wabtec has opened in Derby as part of its expansion into asset analytics and condition monitoring to support predictive maintenance.

Wabtec already operates four Global Performance Optimisation Centres in the USA Brazil and Kazakhstan monitoring more than 18 000 freight locomotive marine engine and off-highway vehicle systems generating 10 million items of data per day enabling failures to be predicted before they occur. It is now looking to expand the technology in the European passenger sector.

‘The combination of our inherent experience in global asset management access to monitoring technology analysis platforms and maintenance capabilities provide a winning combination for our customers’ said Garry Mowbray Wabtec’s Vice-President of Regional Services on August 9.

Porterbrook is to use the TPOC’s services across 4 000 passenger rolling stock assets. Key projects include Class 170 DMU powerpack ‘power by the mile’ Class 158/9 and 168 engine swoil analysis and Class 172 powerpack analytics.

The leasing company’s Chief Operating Officer Ben Ackroyd said better analysis would provide ‘more dependable whole-life asset management capabilities to passenger and freight operators’ and ‘drive improved and more consistent performance and give us the opportunity to further leverage technology in our mission to deliver a safe reliable and sustainable railway’.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1LmNvbS9uZXdzL25hdGlvbmFsL2tlcmFsYS9paXQtcGFsYWtrYWQtaGl0cy05Ny1wbGFjZW1lbnQvYXJ0aWNsZTY1NzU4NDcxLmVjZdIBZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1LmNvbS9uZXdzL25hdGlvbmFsL2tlcmFsYS9paXQtcGFsYWtrYWQtaGl0cy05Ny1wbGFjZW1lbnQvYXJ0aWNsZTY1NzU4NDcxLmVjZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IIT Palakkad hits 97% placement,"August 11 2022 08:02 pm | Updated 08:02 pm IST - PALAKKAD

The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Palakkad made a big leap in its campus placements for the 2021-22 academic year. With an overall 97% placement there was a sharp increase not only in the number of companies taking part in the recruitment but also in the number of offers and placements made. The average salary offered to the students too increased considerably.

When the highest annual salary offered during the 2021-22 was ₹1.2 crore the average annual salary offered was ₹13.93 lakh. “There was nearly 22% increase in the average salary offer for the year 2021-22” said Santhosh Kumar R. training and placement officer of IIT Palakkad.

The institution has excelled among the third-generation IITs in the country in finding better opportunities for its students. “Our placement record for last year (2021-22) has been very good. More international companies have begun to show up and placements in the core sector too have increased” said P.B. Sunil Kumar director IIT Palakkad.

When 211 companies participated in the recruitment drive that lasted several months from August 2021 as many as 207 offers made. The median annual salary offered to BTech computer science students was 15.05 lakh. The median salary for BTech electrical engineering was ₹12 lakh BTech mechanical engineering and civil engineering ₹10 lakh.

The major recruiters were Indeed Texas Instruments Adobe AMD Maruti Suzuki MathWorks Arista Networks L&T Group GE Versa Networks Wabtec Corp Paytm Deloitte IBM Cargill Capgemini Tejas Networks ZVC India ICICI Bank HCL Intel Qualcomm Mercedes Benz Tata Group and OLA.

“Although 57% placement took place in IT sector core engineering sector witnessed nearly 22% placement and that’s commendable. A good number of core companies visited this current season and recruited the students” said Prof. Sunil Kumar.

A good number of IIT Palakkad graduates have decided to pursue higher studies in reputed institutes such as Georgia Tech University of Birmingham Arizona State University Purdue University North Carolina State University and Brown University. “These statistics stand as true evidence of the skills of the students that our quality curriculum has nurtured” said Mr. Santhosh Kumar.

The momentum set by the 2021-22 has begun to reflect in the current recruitment season which has just begun. Several companies have evinced interest to visit IIT Palakkad as early as in August. “We are looking forward to a wonderful season” said Mr. Santhosh Kumar.",,,,,,

In 1980 thousands of refugees — including Linh Peters and her family — were stranded on a cargo ship in Hong Kong Harbor for five months. // Photo: South China Morning Post

Forging her career path

If data is king loyalty is royalty

Little things big impact: Her best customer experiences

Finding your personal board of directors

How to be a leader according to Linh

Relationships matter. “Take time to build relationships that are rooted in trust respect and transparency. It will enable you to move fast innovate and take risks. And if you create that environment for your team your people will run through walls for you.”

“Take time to build relationships that are rooted in trust respect and transparency. It will enable you to move fast innovate and take risks. And if you create that environment for your team your people will run through walls for you.” Always assume positive intent. “One of my leaders gave me this advice early in my career and I lead this way to this day.”

“One of my leaders gave me this advice early in my career and I lead this way to this day.” Feedback is a gift. “As a leader it’s important to give timely and actionable feedback to your teams. It’s also important for you to ask for feedback.”

“As a leader it’s important to give timely and actionable feedback to your teams. It’s also important for you to ask for feedback.” Your team’s success should be as important as your own success. “It's my duty as a leader to ensure my team is set up for success. That comes through empowerment support guidance and feedback. I'm really proud of the things I've accomplished but some of the best moments of my career have been when I've helped other people succeed.”

“It's my duty as a leader to ensure my team is set up for success. That comes through empowerment support guidance and feedback. I'm really proud of the things I've accomplished but some of the best moments of my career have been when I've helped other people succeed.” Be a lifelong learner. “Always be curious. Ask questions. Admit when you don’t know the answer. Some of my biggest achievements have been born out of working with people who were smarter than me.”

The power of a thank-you

f you asked Linh Peters where shes from she used to say “Minnesota.”But that’s not the whole story.These days she’s embracing the importance of bringing your authentic self to work. Peters who stepped into the role of senior vice president and chief marketing officer for Walgreens in May is also a believer that storytelling can be a powerful tool. Even her own story.Peters is of Chinese ethnicity but was born in Vietnam where she lived with her family until they immigrated to the U.S. in 1980. They left on an illegal boat with a few thousand other people and their cargo ship made its way to Hong Kong Harbor after a failed attempt by the ship’s captain to leave the passengers stranded on a deserted island. At the time the Hong Kong government was dealing with a significant increase in refugees. Unable to manage the onslaught the government decided to stop accepting more people. The passengers were forced to stay on the cargo ship—and they remained stranded in the harbor for five excruciating months.“Imagine thousands of people on a cargo ship. No food no water just trying to survive” Peters remembers. “Eventually there was a group of men who said ‘We can’t do this anymore.’ And they swam for shore. My father was one of those people. And because a number of the men could not swim the government was forced into action when they began to drown. It was the beginning of my family’s journey to the United States.”Years later Peters learned that her family’s immigration journey was featured in a National Geographic cover story. She hangs onto the article to this day—a physical reminder of how far she’s come. She also has the name of the cargo ship “Skyluck” inscribed on her wrist. It’s a constant reminder for her to be grateful for the life she’s achieved.“I now realize that my immigration story has had a profound impact on who I am as a person and as a leader” Peters says. “A decade ago I don't know that I would have been proud to share my story or thought that it would be relevant to others. But it has given me not only a reason to lead with empathy but also a deeply rooted commitment to help those who are underserved and underrepresented. It’s why Walgreens’ mission and purpose resonate with me on such a personal level. I am an example of what can happen when someone has access to support services and a community.”She really did grow up in Minnesota. Peters graduated from University of Minnesota with a degree in public relations and advertising before getting her MBA at the University’s Carlson School of Management. Fast forward to today and she has a resume unlike many others.Before joining Walgreens Peters worked for some of the biggest consumer brands in the world: Best Buy Target SpartanNash Ulta Beauty Starbucks and Calvin Klein. The thread connecting all these brands was the opportunity to help transform business models and organizations modernize and innovate new marketing capabilities and create first-to-market customer experiences.“I've worked in what feels like every industry and type of customer journey but the opportunity to come to Walgreens was really personal” Peters says. “Especially going through the pandemic keeping your family healthy was at the forefront of everybody’s mind including my own. As a mom and a wife the opportunity to meld what I'm personally passionate about with what we can do as a business is a dream come true.”Throughout her career Peters has been able to build launch and grow loyalty programs for several major brands. The intersection of data digital and customer experience is what she loves. Walgreens’ loyalty program which relaunched in 2020 as myWalgreens  has recently hit a significant milestone: 100+ million members. Peters gets excited just thinking about the potential and believes we’ve just scratched the surface.“There are few loyalty programs of our size and scale” she says. “It goes to show you just how many customers engage with our brand. We’ve done a really good job of building this program. Now we have to evolve our value proposition program construct and member experience to deliver a more meaningful experience in the space of health and wellbeing.“We also have an opportunity to innovate in terms of how we define engagement and loyalty and the impact that myWalgreens can have on the business as a driver of growth” she continues. “Much of myWalgreens has played in the retail space but there are huge opportunities as we think about pharmacy Walgreens Health and our B2B partners.”What’s the best customer experience you’ve ever had? For Peters it’s the moments when a brand has anticipated her needs and been there—when they’ve given her something she didn’t even know she needed.And it usually shows up in small ways. Like the time when her 7-year-old son was obsessed with airplanes and he created a giant cardboard airplane modeled after a Delta plane. She was so proud she took a photo put it on social media and tagged @Delta.“They reached out and said ‘We would love to send your son something’” Peters says. “Two weeks later a package showed up at our house with a captain's hat aviator glasses and a T-shirt. I cannot tell you how excited my son was to get that. And as a customer I was just thrilled. That’s what I mean when I think of creating delightful experiences for our customers in a way that’s fun and unexpected. And to this day my loyalty to Delta has remained strong because of that moment.“It’s those little things that can really make or break a customer’s experience with our brand” she continues. “I tell my team our job as marketers is to create a better customer experience. We need to expand what that looks like. What customer problem are we trying to solve?”Peters admits she wouldn’t be where she is today without the support from mentors and advocates along the way.“Early on in my career somebody gave me good advice. They said ‘Just like companies have a board of directors you need to have a personal board of directors’” Peters says. “There are many facets of your career of how you lead and of what leadership means so having a group of leaders with varied backgrounds experiences and strengths is powerful. I can go to them ask a question and get five different responses. It expands my point of view and helps me be more informed and more thoughtful in my decision making. It’s not about one person serving multiple needs it’s about multiple people serving one need.”Her personal board is made up of leaders she’s worked with as well as people she admires and respects across different industries. She says the key is having a clear idea of your career goals and aspirations and what type of support or guidance you need to achieve them and then selecting individuals who excel to fill your board.Just as Peters has built up her support network she’s also established a leadership rulebook of sorts her ways of working and how she interacts with her team. Here they are in her words:The notion that small gestures can make waves has been adopted by some of the world’s most inspirational leaders who know that recognition comes in many forms. When Peters thinks about leaders who inspire her she brings up one of the last books she read: Indra Nooyi’s memoir “My Life in Full: Work Family and Our Future.” Peters related to Nooyi on many levels—she’s a woman a diverse leader a wife and a mother. The book was business strategy meets human strategy detailing how the former CEO of Pepsi juggled both home life and a successful career.One of Nooyi’s leadership behaviors that resonated with Peters focused on the idea of recognition. While at Pepsi Nooyi handwrote letters to the spouses and families of her direct reports thanking them for enabling their family member to show up and be a good leader. She also acknowledged that work sometimes took them away from family and thanked them for their unwavering support. Nooyi was met with unexpected admiration and an overwhelming outpouring of appreciation. She said it was one of the best things she ever did.“It reminds you as a leader that we have an incredibly passionate energetic dedicated team but that doesn't dismiss the fact that we sometimes ask them to prioritize work over family commitments” adds Peters. “And it made me realize that the people who show up as a little square on a Teams call there's a village behind them. A simple thank-you can be incredibly powerful.”Peters is nearly 90 days in to her new role as CMO of Walgreens and she takes a moment to reflect on that milestone.“We’re in the midst of transformation and change but I wake up every day so excited to be here because I see the opportunities we have to create a meaningful impact on the lives of our customers patients and team members” she says. “It’s why I’m thrilled to be a part of this team and organization. And I know there are many people at Walgreens who feel this way. To be able to surround myself with people who are equally as passionate energized and committed as I am—it’s why my job feels less like a job and more like a purpose.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL3dhbGdyZWVucy1wcmVzY3JpcHRpb25zLWNvbnRyaWJ1dGVkLW9waW9pZC1lcGlkZW1pYy0xNDM5MzM4MjQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walgreens prescriptions added to San Francisco's opioid epidemic - judge,"FILE PHOTO: People walk by a Walgreens owned by the Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. in Manhattan New York City

By Dietrich Knauth

(Reuters) -Walgreens Boots Alliance contributed to the opioid epidemic in San Francisco through its sale of prescription drugs in the city a federal judge concluded on Wednesday.

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco said that Walgreens failed to properly investigate suspicious opioid orders for nearly 15 years. The amount the pharmacy chain must pay will be determined in a later trial.

Walgreens' pharmacists filled hundreds of thousands of suspicious opioid prescriptions from 2006 to 2020 with pharmacists not given time staffing or resources to properly investigate red flags Breyer wrote.

San Francisco in 2018 sued Walgreens as well as several drug manufacturers and distributors over the opioid epidemic in the city saying they created a ""public nuisance"" by flooding the city with prescription opioids and failing to prevent the drugs from being diverted for illegal use.

A trial began in April and all of the defendants except Walgreens reached settlements with the city before the court ruled.

Breyer said San Francisco had shown that Walgreens' lax oversight led to illegal drug use that substantially contributed to the opioid epidemic in the city.

Walgreens said that it was disappointed with the ruling and intends to appeal.

""We never manufactured or marketed opioids nor did we distribute them to the 'pill mills' and internet pharmacies that fueled this crisis"" Walgreens spokesman Fraser Engerman said.

The opioid epidemic has caused more than 500000 opioid overdose deaths over two decades according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 3300 opioid lawsuits have been filed nationally against drug manufacturers distributors and pharmacies culminating with many of the other companies - though not the pharmacies - agreeing to proposed global settlements.

The opioid crisis has hit San Francisco hard with opioid-related emergency room tripling from 886 in 2015 to 2998 in 2020 according to the court ruling.

Paul Geller an attorney who represented the city in the case credited San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu for working to hold companies accountable for contributing to ""the horrific epidemic in the Bay Area.”

Walgreens was found liable in 2021 for contributing to the opioid epidemic in a similar trial brought by two Ohio counties. Walgreens and its co-defendants CVS Health Inc and Walmart are awaiting a ruling from the Ohio court on the amount they must pay to address the opioid crisis in those counties.

San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu said the pharmacy chain “continually violated what they were required to do under the federal Controlled Substances Act” failing to track opioid prescriptions preventing pharmacists from vetting prescriptions and “nor did they see the many red flags of physicians and others who were dramatically over-prescribing.”

“Pharmacists were pressured to fill fill fill” he said “and as a result Walgreens filled our streets with opioids.”

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ruled that for 15 years Walgreens dispensed hundreds of thousands of pills eventually contributing to the city’s hospitals being overwhelmed with opioid patients libraries being forced to close because of syringe-clogged toilets and syringes littering children’s playgrounds in San Francisco.

A Walgreens spokesman said the chain is disappointed in the outcome which he said is not supported by the facts and the law.

“As we have said throughout this process we never manufactured or marketed opioids nor did we distribute them to the ‘pill mills’ and internet pharmacies that fueled this crisis” spokesman Fraser Engerman said in a statement. “The plaintiff’s attempt to resolve the opioid crisis with an unprecedented expansion of public nuisance law is misguided and unsustainable. We look forward to the opportunity to address these issues on appeal.”

San Francisco in 2018 sued Walgreens and drug manufacturers and distributors over the city’s worsening opioid epidemic saying they created a “public nuisance” by flooding the city with prescription opioids. All the other defendants previously settled with the city for a total of $114 million including $54 million that opioid makers Allergan and Teva agreed to pay on the eve of closing arguments in the trial leaving Walgreens as the sole defendant.

Wednesday’s ruling did not include a ruling on monetary damages which will be determined in a future trial.

The opioid epidemic has been linked to more than 500000 deaths in the U.S. over the past two decades counting those from prescription painkillers such as OxyContin and generic oxycodone as well as illicit drugs such as heroin and illegally produced fentanyl.

The surge in deaths has led to more than 3000 lawsuits filed by state and local governments Native American tribes unions hospitals and other entities in state and federal courts over the toll of opioids. In San Francisco Mayor London Breed declared a state of emergency last year in the Tenderloin neighborhood saying something had to be done about the high concentration of drug dealers and people consuming drugs in public.

The city attorney’s office says San Francisco saw a nearly 500 percent increase in opioid-related overdose deaths between 2015 and 2020 and that on a typical day roughly a quarter of visits at the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital Emergency Department are opioid-related.

In 2020 712 people died of drug overdoses compared with 257 people who died of COVID-19 according to the city health department.

A high percentage of an estimated 7800 homeless people in San Francisco — many of whom pitch tents in the Tenderloin — are struggling with chronic addiction or severe mental illness often both. Some people rant in the streets nude and in need of medical help.

Pharmacy chains have been sued less often than opioid makers or wholesalers that distribute pharmaceuticals more broadly. In one groundbreaking case a federal jury in Ohio last year found CVS Walgreens and Walmart recklessly distributed massive amounts of pain pills in two Ohio counties.

In May Walgreens reached a $683 million settlement with the state of Florida in a lawsuit accusing the company of improperly dispensing millions of painkillers that contributed to the opioid crisis. Walgreens did not admit wrongdoing in its agreement with Florida and will make payments to the state over 18 years.

The company also faces litigation in Alabama Michigan and New Mexico among other states.

Deerfield Illinois-based Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. runs a network of around 9000 drugstores in the United States. Walgreens and other prescription drug distributors have faced a slew of lawsuits over the opioid crisis.

Pharmacists are in such high demand that Walgreens is dangling lucrative signing bonuses to fill open positions.

The amount that the pharmacy chain is offering in the signing bonuses to recruit pharmacists varies but can go as high as $75000 a person familiar with the matter told CNN.

The lucrative bonuses come with a requirement for the new pharmacists to stick around in their positions for a period of time typically a year or longer the person said. News of the signing bonuses was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

It’s not clear what the average is for a pharmacy signing bonus at Walgreens but the source said the average is certainly lower than $50000.

In a statement Walgreens confirmed it is leaning on bonuses in an effort to ease staffing shortages. The company is owned by Walgreen Boots Alliance (WBA)

“This is one of many steps to address pharmacy staffing in some areas in order to best meet the needs of our customers and patients” Walgreens said in a statement.

Walgreens said that sign-on bonuses vary and are part of a larger investment focused on recruitment and retention as well as “recognizing our current pharmacy staff for their hard work and dedication.”

The news underscores how worker shortages persist more than two years into the pandemic especially in certain positions and in some labor markets.

The United States had 10.7 million job openings in June according to the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey or JOLTS. That is the lowest since September 2021 but still well above pre-Covid levels of around 7 million.",,,

Her accused killer Xuan Thanh Vo 32 was arraigned in Kalamazoo County District Court Thursday.

Vo was charged with one count of open murder. His bond was denied.

Vo's lawyer said she doesn't think he is competent to stand trial. The lawyer has requested a Vietnamese interpreter.

Investigators identified the woman as 65-year-old Sandra Villarreal.



Walmart homicide:



The suspect was in other box store parking lots allegedly looking to perform similar acts of violence Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller said.

“These things are tragic. They have happened in our community before and sadly I fear our future will have more” he said.

Vo told police ""he woke up he was angry and lonely and missed his ex-girlfriend and decided he wanted to hill someone with his car by running them over"" according to probable cause documents.

Those same documents said Vo also considered doing the same thing at a Meijer in Battle Creek and a Meijer in Oshtemo Township prior to the alleged killing.

Watch:

She and Vo did not know each other or have any prior interaction in the parking lot before Vo intentionally hit her with his car investigators said.



A 2015 maroon Acura parked near the back of the Oshtemo Township Walmart parking lot on Tuesday pulled out and drove directly at the victim according to witnesses.

Witnesses watch in horror:

The driver got out of the car and ran from the scene according to investigators.

Two bystanders chased after Vo and he was taken into custody on 9th Street.

Cell phone video showed two people in the street pointing police in the direction of the suspect.

In a statement to News Channel 3 a Walmart spokesperson said “We are deeply saddened by the tragic incident that occurred in the parking lot of our Kalamazoo store. Our hearts are broken for the victim’s family. We will continue working closely with law enforcement as they investigate the incident.”

According to the civil lawsuit filed in federal court in June Essie McKenzie says Walmart’s failure to monitor overnight campers in its parking lots creates a public nuisance amounts to negligence that can create dangerous situations like the one her daughters were seriously injured in and caused the wrongful death of one of her daughters.

Fire crews were called to the Walmart just off University Avenue Northeast and 85th Avenue Northwest at around 7:13 a.m. on Aug. 6 2019 on a report of a vehicle on fire in the parking lot. As firefighters worked to put out the flames McKenzie ran out of the store and started screaming that her daughters were in one of the vehicles engulfed by flames.

The girls — ages 6 and 9 at the time — were pulled from the vehicle by firefighters and rushed to a hospital in critical condition. The 6-year-old died the next day and the 9-year-old suffered permanent injuries.

Law enforcement determined that a California couple was traveling through the state in their 2005 Dodge Caravan which they were using as a portable temporary travel home. The night before the couple had slept in the Caravan in the Walmart parking lot and the next morning used a portable cook stove to make breakfast. However they put the stove back in the vehicle afterward before it had completely cooled off then drove the Caravan closer to the front of the lot parking next to McKenzie’s vehicle and the man — Roberto Hipolito — then went into the store.

McKenzie’s lawsuit says she and her daughters had dropped off her mother and another family member at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport that morning for an early flight then came to the Walmart to pick up some items. Her daughters were sleeping so McKenzie decided to let them continue sleeping in the vehicle while she shopped at Walmart.

About two minutes after Hipolito went inside the store a passerby alerted Hipolito’s wife — who was in the front of the Caravan — that the vehicle had caught fire. That fire then spread to the nearby cars including McKenzie’s while her daughters were still inside.

Hipolito pleaded guilty to negligent fire as part of a plea deal and was sentenced in August 2020 to three years of probation with a stayed four-month prison term.

In the lawsuit McKenzie says Walmart’s policy which allows overnight camping in its parking lots along with its failure to monitor the camping areas and conform to state and local ordinances for camping “has created real hazards and thereby endangered the safety and health of those who shop and work in the store or live nearby.” It adds that the “unregulated unlicensed and unmonitored campgrounds pose a threat of illness injury noise and crime to a considerable number of members of the public.”

The lawsuit also cites several state and local statutes for camping that it alleges Walmart violates by allowing campers in its lots and failing to supervise those campers. It adds that Walmart’s negligence “escalated the danger to create a foreseeable risk that Mr. Hipolito would use and store a cook stove negligently and thereby cause harm to others.”

Finally McKenzie’s lawsuit claims that the wrongful death of her daughter Ty’rah came “as a direct and proximate result of (Walmart’s) wrongful acts” as was the monetary and emotional damage suffered by McKenzie and her other daughter Taraji.

In a statement to 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS Walmart spokesperson Randy Hargrove said the company plans to defend itself against the claims.

The small town of Bentonville Arkansas has been the headquarters of Walmart for 50 years.

Longtime residents leaders and real-estate agents say the town has changed a lot.

Bentonville hopes to become a destination for bikers and young professionals.

For 50 years the small town of Bentonville Arkansas has been known as the home of Walmart headquarters. Now the town that the Census Bureau reports has grown by more than 50% since 2010 is building a new reputation as a place for tourists and young professionals.

This reputation has hundreds of millions of dollars behind it thanks to Walmart the Walton Family Foundation and individual members of the Walton family. Local leaders however told Insider that the entire community has embraced the changes.

""When I moved here in 2005 people bought a meal coming into a meeting at Walmart and bought a meal leaving that meeting"" Kalene Griffith the president of Visit Bentonville whose job is to bring tourists to a town that's historically been known as a corporate center told Insider. ""We had one retailer and two restaurants downtown. Now we have 16 restaurants and eight retailers.""

Kalene Griffith is the head of Visit Bentonville. Visit Bentonville

With 63 miles of mountain-biking trails Bentonville leaders declared the city the ""mountain-biking capital of the world."" Other attractions include two state parks located within 30 minutes of the town and an annual half-marathon. Bentonville's mayor Stephanie Orman said the city's museums ""bring in more tourists than biking."" Visit Bentonville estimated that 500000 people visit the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art annually compared to 250000 cyclists on the town's trails.

Stephanie Orman is the mayor of Bentonville. City of Bentonville

The first five miles of bike trails were added in 2007 — the same year voters approved a 10-year bond to expand the municipal airport build and improve parks and provide general infrastructure upkeep.

According to data collected by Visit Bentonville the number of homes in the town has increased by 150%. The prices have also shot up Trina Hammond who heads a team at Keller Williams Realty told Insider. She owns a home in downtown Bentonville and has been a realtor for 15 years.

""One of the biggest real-estate changes is that downtown home prices have more than doubled in the last five years. People want to be able to walk to the bars restaurants museums and bike paths"" Hammond said adding that northwest Arkansas is reshaping how people view the state. ""The big surprise that transplants from places like California have is that they expect cheap land and housing but as the city has boomed it has pushed them to more affordable housing in the suburbs.""

The decades-long rebrand has attracted visitors who in the past may have driven by Bentonville without giving it a second thought. Chris Moody a roving freelance writer who travels thousands of miles a year with his wife in a self-built camper van told Insider the pair recently made a detour just to see Bentonville after hearing about the city's expansion and investment in the arts particularly the Crystal Bridges Museum.

Chris and Cristi Moody. Chris and Cristi Moody

""We had a great time visiting the museum. It was worth the trip"" Moody said. ""Bentonville is making a clear play to attract young families looking for a modern quality of life without having to live near a big city.""

Walmart is still a major influence in the city's growth and evolution

Walmart is the elephant in the room with any discussion about Bentonville's growth. Service-providing companies are the largest employers in Bentonville according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Orman attributed this to Walmart building its new corporate headquarters in the town; additionally more than 1600 Walmart suppliers had offices in the town as of 2018 up from 445 in 2001.

And even funding for community projects that doesn't come from Walmart often comes from its founders. OZ Trails and the holding company Runway Group which have taken leading roles in trail and biking development in northwest Arkansas including in Bentonville are run by Sam Walton's grandsons Steuart and Tom. In a 2018 press release the Walton Family Foundation said that it had invested $74 million to build 163 miles of trails in the region.

Walmart and many Waltons also support the city's museums: The Crystal Bridges Museum was founded by Alice Walton and received $20 million from Walmart in 2011 to cover free admission to the museum while the Momentary a contemporary art space opened in 2020 with financial support from the Walton Family Foundation.

Another Walton nonprofit the Walton Family Charitable Support Foundation has funded a three-year grant at NorthWest Arkansas Community College for the nation's first bicycle assembly and repair technician program to be accredited by the Bicycle Industry Employers Association which creates educational partnerships for bike technicians.

The program is intended to support the influx of competitive and casual cyclists. The first cohort of 23 students started last fall Megan Bolinder the college's dean of workforce and economic development who heads the technician program told Insider. ""Students will take nine classes to receive the certificate and then if they choose the coursework can be used for an associate's degree in general technology at NWACC which then transfers to two universities in Arkansas"" she said.

Longtime residents have mixed feelings about the town's growth

Jack Lloyd has spent his entire life in Bentonville as have his children and grandchildren. Born in 1964 he told Insider he estimated the town's population was around 3500 people at the time — which is barely larger than the student population he now oversees as principal of Bentonville High School.

""Bentonville really began changing around 2004"" when Walmart vendors began moving operations to the town Lloyd said. He added that while the growth has been explosive ""outgrowing anything that could be planned"" it was very well-managed.

""You couldn't build roads and homes fast enough and we were adding 100 to 200 students per year at the high school"" he said. But Bentonville's rural environment worked in its favor. ""Sleepier communities and farms that weren't developed became places for new homes and businesses without causing major issues"" he said.

While Lloyd said a lot of locals complain about increased traffic and housing prices it's a matter of perspective. ""People from Sacramento think this is nothing. And for locals you can earn more money than other parts of Arkansas. I've spent 32 years as a teacher vice principal and principal and I've never seen so many opportunities for students to work with the businesses that have come to town"" he said.

""When I was a kid the town center was where things happened"" Lloyd added. ""That changed a few decades ago when Walmart built new headquarters near the highway. But with the museums restaurants and bike trails all centered on downtown it's now the happening place again.""

Elizabeth Ganey has mixed views on Bentonville's rapid growth. She and her husband moved to the town to work at Walmart 11 years ago when the company offered them jobs after they recieved their MBA degrees. ""There are opportunities here that my kids wouldn't have had 10 years ago"" she told Insider. ""But I'm also not a crowd person which is something you have to deal with in Bentonville.""

Visit Bentonville

To avoid the increasingly crowded neighborhoods and downtown streets Ganey and her husband moved with their three children to an 11-acre property between Bentonville and nearby Siloam Springs. She said living outside of the town proper allows the family to ""pick and choose"" which parts of northwest Arkansas they visit for different needs. ""The Bentonville library is the best in the area. Our kids go to a private school one town over and we take the kids to Siloam Springs for non-crowd fun"" she said.

Ganey is now the marketing coordinator for St. Stephen Catholic Church in Bentonville while her husband works at a tech startup. She said his choice is common for alumni of Walmart's corporate headquarters. ""There are a lot of consumer-data startups in the area because they can provide service to Walmart's corporate headquarters Walmart stores in the area and Walmart vendors"" she said.

Conor Brown and Shane Smith live near Bentonville and told Insider they're regulars on its trails as active members of the region's mountain-bike community. They welcomed the town's new brand.

""It's not a secret that Walmart is trying to attract young people to their corporate headquarters"" Brown said. ""Creating a high-quality environment and brand to live work and play is part of that strategy.""

""Bentonville's aspirations are clear but so is their investment in all aspects of the town"" Smith added. ""They've gone from a few trails to a massive infrastructure which services recreational and experienced bikers alike and my girlfriend and I enjoy regularly partaking of what Bentonville offers.""

Griffith and Orman stood behind their ""world capital"" claim. ""Eighty percent of mountain bikers are leisure cyclists"" Griffith said. ""Our trails feature art installations family-friendly and competitive options and a trailhead that goes straight into downtown. Places like Cherokee North Carolina and Tulsa Oklahoma contact us about building their own trail networks. We're happy to help share our experience with them.""

""The 2016 World Summit basically put us on the cycling map"" Orman added. ""We have one of the few trailheads that doesn't require a car to get to. Our trails are open year-round which is very attractive to mountain bikers from snowy regions."""

Disneyland's America Sings characters got a new life in Splash Mountain and Frozen Ever After replaced Norway's Maelstrom attraction in Epcot but kept its ride vehicles and similar ride track. Coming soon Disney will reimagine Splash Mountain with a ""Princess and the Frog"" theme and we can't wait to see how it compares to the original.

3. Liberty Square is more historically accurate than you might have guessed.

Even with its replica Liberty Bell and Liberty Tree Magic Kingdom's Liberty Square is much more authentic than you may have realized. Because there were no modernized bathrooms in the colonial days it's said that there technically aren't any within this land either. Been to the ones in Liberty Tree Tavern or Columbia Harbor House? Well those are supposedly so far back in the restaurant that they're technically in other lands keeping it truly authentic to the time period.

4. Imagineers included their kids (and themselves) in Be Our Guest decor.

Be Our Guest is one of Walt Disney World's toughest restaurant reservations but if you're lucky enough to end up inside don't miss the artwork throughout the ballroom. The snow outside the ornate windows was created from original movie animation cels and the lifelike cherubs lining the ceiling mural bear the faces of children of the Imagineers working on the project — as well as the Imagineers' baby faces themselves!

5. Many of Main Street's flags aren't technically American flags.

Magic Kingdom's Main Street is lined with our nation's flags — only they're not technically American. Because regulations require traditional flags be raised lowered and flown at half-mast each is missing a star or a stripe In order to be left up permanently. They serve double duty too as the flagpoles are actually lightning rods in disguise protecting guests below from inclement weather.

6. There are more Imagineer secrets at the Tower of Terror.

Supposedly the Imagineers working on The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror liked to play pranks on each other many of which involved a certain jar of pickled sausages. They hid and surprised one another with the jar until an Imagineer mistakenly left it behind one night which just so happened to be when every prop was being glued down. The jar still sits behind the photo pickup area today as an insider nod to Disney's geniuses having fun while on the job.

7. This Animal Kingdom ride has a sister attraction at Disneyland.

The turbulent prehistoric thriller Dinosaur at Disney's Animal Kingdom and Indiana Jones Adventure at Disneyland aren't just similar — they feature the same ride track. And if you think Animal Kingdom's turbulent trip backwards through time is scary now just know that Dinosaur in its original form Countdown to Extinction was so terrifying that its original soundtrack motion and interaction had to be toned down.

8.The sidewalks have special meanings.

Disney pays incredible attention to detail right down to the sidewalk you step on. On Main Street the differing colors supposedly help to subconsciously guide guests and keep them from tripping at night and at Liberty Square well the brown wavy path down the center of the road is said to represent how colonial-era residents would dispose of their waste back in the day. (Kind of ruins the craving for fried fish doesn't it?)

9. Main Street's second level pays homage to Disney employees.

Main Street U.S.A. may be an idealized homage to the small towns of Walt Disney's Missouri birthplace but its second level hides references to the company's most valued employees. Each window inscription is actually a distinctive honor personalized to an integral ""cast member"" who made a noteworthy contribution to the park. Look up and you'll see cheeky dedications to folks like Buddy Baker who composed the music for many Disney films and theme park attractions; Roy O. Disney who ensured Magic Kingdom opened after his brother Walt's passing; and artists like Yale Gracey and Claude Coats for their theatrics and tricks put on display in rides like Haunted Mansion.

10. Even the trash is magical at Magic Kingdom.

Given that it's the ""Most Magical Place On Earth"" it only makes sense that Magic Kingdom's garbage is magical as well. The theme park uses an AVAC pneumatic tube system which sucks garbage through vacuum tubes in various spots throughout the park to a central location just beyond Fronteirland's Splash Mountain. Invented in Sweden the tube system never really took off in the states but is still utilized in the Disney theme park to this day.

11. And trash cans are very strategically placed.

Speaking of trash did you know that there are trash cans positioned every 30 feet in Disney parks? These ubiquitous bins help keep the park tidy but they've also developed a bit of a following. You'll notice uniquely themed trash cans throughout the parks and you can even purchase trash can merchandise from Disney.

12. Haunted Mansion has almost as many secrets as ghosts.

The hallowed history of Disney's Haunted Mansion has yielded many interesting factoids but there are plenty more within the cobweb-covered manse so long as you pay close attention. If it's quiet enough you can hear gargoyles whispering for you to leave the ""stretching room."" Conversely the ghastly piano player at the beginning of the journey is playing the attraction's iconic ""Grim Grinning Ghosts"" even if you can't audibly hear the music. Don't get too distracted by the many spirits within the dining room scene and miss the Hidden Mickey made from plates on the dinner table — or the homage to Donald Duck by way of the ride's creepily decorated armchair midway through. It doesn't stop there; take a peek at the graveyard just outside the ride's exit and you'll see a gravestone dedicated to Mr. Toad — a nod to Mr. Toad's Wild Ride which was removed to make way for a Winnie The Pooh ride two decades ago.

13. Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge has tons of Easter eggs for fans in the know.

Though Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge at Disney's Hollywood Studios is a new land themed more to the recent films it still has some serious connections to the classics. Droids wheels modeled after a ""A New Hope""-era R2-D2 were dragged through the walkways for authenticity and select merchandise was even created by digitally scanning props and costumes in the Lucasfilm archives and replicating them for purchase. All the things you'd expect to be for sale are — lightsabers droids stuffed Yodas — but a few hidden favorites are intended for only the biggest of Star Wars fans.

14. There's a super-exclusive suite in Cinderella Castle.

Most Disney fans are aware there's a secret room hidden inside Cinderella Castle but given that you can't book a night or even beg your way in only a lucky few are allowed to see what's inside the fabled Cinderella Castle Suite. Located through a nondescript door within the castle is a lobby lined with tapestries where guests board an elevator to be whisked up to the suite. Its foyer which features a glass slipper and crown on display cels from the original animated film on the walls and a tiled floor mosaic of the princess' gilded carriage on the floor sets the scene for a true bedroom tucked within Walt Disney World's stunning tower. The mystical room is breathtaking — the view although somewhat obscured is unparalleled — but it's the details that are never discussed including marble columns with Cinderella's mice etched into the top and an antique desk that's hundreds of years old that surprise and wow. There's even a royal ""bath chamber"" with a starry sky over the tub proving it's truly fit for royalty.

15. A members-only club has private locations in all four theme parks.

Walt Disney World has its own private members club — and the locations are hiding in plain sight. It's called Club 33 and it's a spinoff of Disneyland's hallowed version only here each theme park has its own unique take. Epcot's is located above the American Adventure Magic Kingdom's is to the right of the Adventureland entrance Disney's Hollywood Studios operates one on the second floor of the Hollywood Brown Derby restaurant and a fourth called Harambe House can be found at Disney's Animal Kingdom; all four offer a theme honoring a different aspect of Walt Disney's life and travels. You can get nary a peek inside without a member but know the spaces are impeccably decorated with plenty of nods to the man who started it all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90cmF2ZWwvMjAyMi8wOC8xMS9kaXNuZXktY3J1aXNlLXdpc2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,My husband had a Disney-free childhood. Then we took a Disney cruise.,"On day two of our three-night cruise aboard the new Disney Wish from Port Canaveral to the Bahamas my husband asked me a question I was surprised hadn’t already come up in our nearly six years raising two young kids together in Florida. “So wait” he said over omelets and Mickey-eared pancakes at 1923 restaurant aboard the 4000-passenger ship that debuted in July as Disney’s newest ship in 10 years.

“Is it called ‘Walt Disney World’ because of an actual person?” he asked.

Javier is from Cuba. And his upbringing on the communist tropical island resembled that of our kids in Tampa — not to mention my own childhood four decades ago in the suburbs of Northern Virginia — in almost no relatable way.

While he’d spent his youth raising rabbits to sell for meat and scaling coconut trees in his bare feet to pick their fruit I’d taken Girl Scout cookie orders in the Safeway parking lot and pedaled my Huffy to the 7-Eleven for peach Nehi sodas. Where I’d lobbied my parents for a trip to Walt Disney World he’d been happy visiting the city park.

Javier was nearly 40 by the time he immigrated to the United States (shortly after we met) and raising kids together brought our differences into sharper focus. As often happens in our relationship I discovered that something seemingly universal — in this case Disney — isn’t well universal.

So in that restaurant decorated with sketches and props from “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” and “Cinderella” among other films he’d watched for the first time with our kids I explained that Walt Disney had been a real person.

As an American I couldn’t imagine a childhood untouched by the brand. Meanwhile Javier wasn’t really sure when — or if — he’d even heard of Mickey Mouse as a kid. Most of the cartoons he grew up watching were Russian dubbed in Spanish and broadcast on state television at 6:30 every evening (he once dug some up on YouTube for our kids who promptly requested he switch back to “Finding Nemo” and “Moana”).

Our children — 4 and 5 — are prime ages for believing in Disney magic. And I was as excited for them to meet the characters as I was to relive my own childhood through their eyes. I wondered whether the cruise would feel like gibberish to Javier but if my husband is any indication the experience translates even if you’re introduced to it in middle age.

Our ship helped — it had references to the movies and characters everywhere you looked. A fantastical glass bubble chandelier in the piano bar Nightingale’s was inspired by Cinderella’s soap suds; Rapunzel’s golden locks drape from the ship’s stern. There’s even an app to unlock augmented reality experiences referencing Moana Tinkerbell Tiana and other characters hidden throughout the tech-savvy vessel.

Other Disney touches are more immersive. At the ship’s “Frozen”-themed dining experience one of three offered to passengers our children fully bought into the fairy tale that they were walking through the hallway of Elsa and Anna’s childhood castle on their way to Anna and Kristoff’s engagement party. Seeing the wonder in their eyes as Elsa and Anna popped by our table to thank them for coming was an experience Javier and I will remember for a long while.

The Wish purports to dish up more perks for adult guests than any other Disney ship to date and as soon as our kids discovered the Oceaneer Club — the ship’s onboard space for 3-to-12-year-olds where you can “drop” them off via a tube slide that descends from the Grand Hall to multiple themed play zones — Javier and I might as well have been on our own solo getaway. (After he took the slide down with them a few times that is.)

From Deck 13 at the adults-only Quiet Cove reserved for guests 18 and older we sipped cocktails (pricey but on par with bar tabs back home between $15 and $20 a pop) and read magazines while watching the ocean rush by below. Then we’d catch wind of an upcoming meet-and-greet with a character the kids couldn’t miss and pick them up to be regaled with stories about the Star Wars-themed playroom or how Goofy had already popped by.

At Castaway Cay Disney’s private island in the Bahamas we coaxed them ashore for a few hours of beach and waterslide fun before they caught wind that there was a shore-based “camp” too. They spent an hour playing while Javier and I rented bikes to pedal along a paved path that cuts through the island to a lookout tower where he spotted wild orchids growing in the tangle of scrub bush at its base (you can take the boy out of the Caribbean and surround him with Disney fun but he won’t forget his island roots).

Back on board I was starting to feel exhausted by all the stimulation and Javier’s limited prior exposure to the Disney universe proved to be an asset. I finally reached my threshold for ambient noise over dinner one night at the Worlds of Marvel dining experience. But Javier for whom themed dining had become a reality only since moving to the United States was fully into it picking up my unenthusiastic slack (tag-team parenting at its finest).

Advertisement

As a respite we booked the late seating for an adults-only dinner at Palo Steakhouse a mainstay on all Disney ships (new on the Wish there’s also the “Beauty and the Beast”-themed adult-only restaurant Enchanté for upscale French fare). The four-course Italian-inspired dinner landed plate by plate (the burrata with heirloom tomatoes and Aperol spritzes took me back to Venice in summer) as a young server from South Africa regaled us with stories of his adventurous world travels between cruise contracts.

Javier told him how lucky he was to be able to get out and see the world at such a young age — even if mostly through the porthole of an undoubtedly intense onboard work schedule — something that had never been an option for him growing up in Cuba.

The three nights passed in a blur of nonstop entertainment including the Broadway-style “Little Mermaid” stage show in the 1274-seat Walt Disney Theater and a pirate-themed night on the main deck that ended with fireworks and a very realistic Jack Sparrow. None of us was ever asleep before 10 p.m. the kids immediately crashing like dead weight into bunks suspended from our snug stateroom’s ceiling.

Advertisement

When we awoke on our last morning to find the boat already docked in Port Canaveral tears flowed. After breakfast Javier pulled the kids out onto the main deck for one last photo together.

“They’re so lucky” he said.

And so were we. You’re never too old to have fun like a kid.

His vision revolutionized the American vacation. But despite Disneyland’s success Disney quickly realized that his 160-acre flagship theme park wasn’t big enough to contain all of his dreams. What Disney truly wanted was to create a fully immersive theatrical experience. Because he didn’t own the land surrounding the park however tacky hotels and fast-food restaurants began popping up outside the park gates tarnishing Walt’s glittering fantasyland.



In 1964 the Walt Disney Company began scouting locations for “Disneyland East.” Under the guise of shell companies with tongue-in-cheek names like M.T. Lott Real Estate Investments Disney secretly scooped up huge tracts of Florida swampland for about $180 an acre. The location guaranteed that Disney’s new vacation destination would be protected from commercial sprawl. “In Florida we have something special we never enjoyed at Disneyland — the blessing of size” Disney said in a 1965 television program announcing the company’s Florida project. “There is enough land here to hold all the ideas and plans we could possibly imagine.”

Sadly Walt Disney never realized those ideas and plans — the pioneering animator died just six weeks later. But the Florida project lived on through Walt’s older brother Roy who postponed retirement to take the helm. In October 1971 Roy Disney stood beside Mickey Mouse and officially named the park Walt Disney World as a tribute to his brother.

Last October marked the 50th anniversary of Walt Disney World which encompasses 43 square miles and includes four theme parks two water parks 25 hotels more than 200 restaurants and a 120-acre shopping and dining complex. Whether this will be your first trip or your 50th prepare to be wowed — the resort has already rolled out plenty of golden anniversary magic including brand-new attractions dazzling park decor and unparalleled nighttime spectaculars. And because the festivities are due to continue through March 2023 there’s even more in store in the coming months.

Here’s our guide to getting the most out of your trip to the “Most Magical Place on Earth.”

Getting There



Most visitors to Disney World will fly into Orlando International Airport which is about 20 miles from the resort’s entrance. As of January 2022 Disney eliminated the Magical Express its complimentary airport transfer service. Travelers on a budget will want to reserve a shuttle like Sunshine Flyer or Mears Connect which costs about $32 round trip. Ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft are another good option. Prices start around $45 one-way and depend upon demand and vehicle size. ​

On-site transportation throughout Walt Disney World which consists of everything from buses and boats to monorails and the new Disney Skyliner is free and efficient making renting a car unnecessary if you opt to stay at one of the on-site Disney hotels. Finally be prepared to do a lot of walking. The average Disney guest walks 7 to 10 miles per day during his or her vacation. Folks with mobility issues can rent wheelchairs and electric conveyance vehicles (ECVs) at each of the four Disney theme parks as well as at the water parks and Disney Springs. Additionally several off-site companies offer multiday wheelchair and ECV rentals at lower prices than you’ll find on Disney property.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2Vhcm5pbmdzL2NhbGwtdHJhbnNjcmlwdHMvMjAyMi8wOC8xMC93YWx0LWRpc25leS1kaXMtcTMtMjAyMi1lYXJuaW5ncy1jYWxsLXRyYW5zY3JpcHQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walt Disney (DIS) Q3 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"DIS earnings call for the period ending June 30 2022.

Bob Chapek -- Chief Executive Officer

Thank you Alexia and good afternoon everyone. We had an excellent quarter powered by world-class storytelling outstanding performance at our domestic theme parks increases in live sports viewership across our linear channels and ESPN+ and significant subscriber growth at our streaming services which added 15.5 million subscriptions in the quarter including 14.4 million Disney+ subscribers of which 6 million were core Disney+ and 8 million were Hotstar. As of the close of Q3 we now have 221 million total subscriptions across our streaming offering. Our results showcased the ability of the Walt Disney Company's uniquely diversified businesses to power our ecosystem and explore growth opportunities across industries and distribution channels.

I'll expand on all this and more and then Christine will go through the details of our results and provide additional insight into our fiscal 2024 expectations for Disney+. Creative excellence in storytelling that build deep emotional connections with audiences is at the root of our success. And I am pleased to say that our creative engines are firing on all cylinders across franchise general entertainment and sports. In a testament to the depth breadth and quality of our creative teams we received 147 Primetime Emmy Award nominations this year including 92 for our streaming platforms and 21 for best program in a genre.

Recognition across formats and distribution channels with 47 different shows receiving nominations including titles like Only Murders in the Building Abbott Elementary What We Do in the Shadows and The Dropout right alongside shows from Disney Marvel and Star Wars. And most recently we received an additional 71 news and documentary Emmy nominations across ABC News National Geographic FX Hulu and ESPN. In addition to critical and industry recognition we are thrilled by the audience response to our general entertainment offerings response that is enhanced by a distribution strategy that maximizes reach by taking advantage of the strength of both our linear and streaming channels. Given the multiple ways we bring our content to audiences we take a thoughtful approach to each distribution decision to determine the best strategy for each of our many high-quality titles and platforms.

Some like the buzz-generating Candy the Kardashians and The Bear may be best served as Hulu Originals. Others like Abbott Elementary and The Old Man have become multi-platform hits by reaching different audience demographics across both linear and streaming. And when it comes to our key franchise content I could not be more proud of the teams at Disney Pixar Marvel and Star Wars. The hugely successful Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness has earned nearly $1 billion at the global box office.

And Thor: Love and Thunder which premiered on July 8 has grossed over $700 million at the global box office and is the highest domestic grossing film of the Thor franchise. Pixar's Lightyear marked the studios return to the big screen and the film debuted on Disney+ last week. Speaking of Disney+ which is now available in 155 markets after recently launching in 53 new territories we released content with appeal across demographic groups including Obi-wan Kenobi and Ms. Marvel as well as feature films like Disney's Chip n' Dale Rescue Rangers and Disneynature's Polar Bear.

As you know Disney+ is still a young business and we are learning more every day about the services ability to attract new fans to our powerhouse franchises. For example in addition to driving engagement among tens of millions of existing Marvel fans we have seen each new Disney+ original Marvel series attract incremental viewership and new subscribers that hadn't previously engaged with Marvel content on the service thanks to the episodic format that enables us to explore new characters and genres. The value of expanding the fan base is tremendous and this new audience can then experience Marvel across our other offerings from consumer products to games to theme parks. Looking ahead Q4 will feature a fantastic Disney+ content slate with a steady flow of key releases including Marvel's She-Hulk: Attorney at Law Lucasfilm's Andor and Disney's Hocus Pocus 2 and we look forward to celebrating the second annual Disney+ Day on September 8 with activations across our synergy machine.

Given the global nature of Disney+ we are thrilled to bring international music sensation BTS to the service with an exclusive cinematic concert film and docuseries following the band's incredible journey. BTS and the K-pop genre at large carry massive global appeal and affinity which will further extend our reach into that global fan base. And we continue to step up our investment in international local originals across formats including bringing the seventh season of Koffee With Karan one of India's most popular talk shows exclusively to Disney+ Hotstar. On the theatrical side we have a robust slate debuting later this year including the highly anticipated Avatar: The Way of Water our newest animated film Strange World and the final film in Marvel's Phase Four Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.

Excitement for this film is amazing and the trailer received more than 170 million views in its first 24 hours. Turning to sports. Our industry-leading run of rights acquisitions positions us extremely well for the future. We will continue to focus on audience expansion and long-term profitability by being disciplined in our acquisition approach and making deliberate distribution decisions for each sport in the portfolio.

The results of this approach were fantastic last quarter as The Walt Disney Company was responsible for 47% of sports hours watched by the 18 to 49 demo in fiscal Q3. Our innovative NHL deal has been a difference maker across platforms with the Stanley Cup playoff viewership up 60% over 2021 across cable and broadcast including significant year-over-year increases in younger demos and female viewers. We also secured exclusive TV rights for the upcoming 2023 to 2027 IPL season following a competitive process where we made disciplined bids with a focus on long-term value. We are excited to continue offering IPL to our linear customers in India where growth potential exists for our portfolio of more than 70 channels that reaches 90% of pay cable and satellite TV homes in the region.

Pay TV distribution in India continues to be a robust business with projected GDP growth expected to drive advertising and consumer spending. In fact India is one of the only markets in which we are launching new linear channels. Finally given the results of our recently completed upfront it is clear that our unmatched portfolio continues to be highly sought after by advertisers. Combined with our deep expertise in ad tech we are in a position of strength with record upfront advertiser commitment leading into the launch of our ad-supported Disney+ tier.

Since the launch of Disney+ advertisers have been asking for the opportunity to connect with audiences alongside the most premium brands in content and streaming. As we shared earlier today the Disney+ ad tier goes live on December 8 and we are taking a thoughtful approach by launching with a lower ad load and frequency to ensure a great experience for viewers. This approach coupled with strong advertiser demand translated into Disney+ earning industry-leading CPM rates at the most recent upfront. Turning to our parks.

This quarter featured new magic around the world and strong operating performance. All of our theme parks are now open and we continue to bring back more of the great experience that guests love that includes Character Meet and Greet Nighttime Spectacular at Disneyland and Theatrical Performances. These offerings are not only big hits with guests but also enable us to welcome more people into our parks each day. We continue to see strong revenue and profit growth at our domestic parks and experience businesses.

Even as our cruise ships and international visitation have yet to fully recover. Domestic demand at our theme parks continues to be strong and we are seeing continued progress in those businesses still recovering from the pandemic. At the same time the business model transformation we have achieved over the past few years have driven substantial increases in per capita spending and give us the flexibility to adapt should economic conditions change. We celebrated three major milestones for our parks and experience business this quarter each of which were priorities I said when I had the opportunity to lead our parks team.

First the innovative and immersive new roller coaster Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind opened in Epcot as part of the park's ongoing transformation to a place that is more family more timeless and more Disney. Second we expanded the Disney Cruise Line fleet with a Disney Wish which sailed its maiden voyage on July 14. This is the first of three new ships and is infused with Disney storytelling one-of-a-kind entertainment and a modern interior aesthetic. It is powered by liquefied natural gas one of the cleanest burning fuels available.

And finally Disneyland Paris opened Avengers Campus on July 20 completing the first phase of our ambitious expansion plan. The new immersive area features two new attractions five action stunts encounters with Marvel superheroes and themed restaurants. I had the opportunity to help open this new land with stars from the Marvel Cinematic Universe and our cast and I could not be more proud of the resort's ongoing transformation. Guests are responding in a big way to our enhanced offering at Disneyland Paris' per capita spending in Q3 was up over 30% versus 2019 a great sign of the site's potential for growth.

I am incredibly pleased with our performance this quarter our competitive position and the unique collection of assets and capabilities that sets us apart. Going forward The Walt Disney Company's incredible employees cast members and creative teams will continue to transform entertainment by combining extraordinary storytelling with innovative technology to create an even larger more connected and magical Disney universe for families and fans around the world. With that I'll hand it over to Christine.

Christine McCarthy -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Thanks Bob and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased with our strong financial results this quarter with diluted earnings per share excluding certain items increasing to $1.09 versus $0.80 in the prior year quarter. At parks experiences and products third quarter revenues increased by more than $3 billion and operating income increased by $1.8 billion versus the prior year reflecting improvements across both domestic and international parks and experiences. Demand at our domestic parks continues to exceed expectations with attendance on many days tracking ahead of 2019 levels.

And our continued focus on improving the guest experience through the use of our reservation system to purposely manage capacity versus simply increasing volume has the added benefit of improving yield and optimizing overall economics. So even while the average daily attendance at our domestic parks across the first three quarters of this fiscal year was slightly below 2019 we have delivered significantly higher revenue and operating income over that same time period. This approach also provides flexibility with levers we can adjust if demand were to shift. Per capita spending at our domestic parks also remained strong increasing 10% versus Q3 of fiscal 2021 and over 40% versus fiscal 2019.

And in another sign of the robust demand we have seen at our parks and resorts occupancy at our domestic hotels in the third quarter was 90%. Looking ahead domestic demand at our theme parks continues to look robust with current forward-looking hotel bookings and intent to visit roughly in line with pre-pandemic trends. Improvement at our international parks in the third quarter was driven by Disneyland Paris where both revenue and operating income exceeded 2019 levels. And we are seeing the same momentum well into Q4 as we continue to celebrate the 30th anniversary and the opening of Avengers Campus in July.

Disneyland Paris' strong performance in the third quarter was partially offset by closure-related impacts at Shanghai Disney Resort where the theme park was closed for all but the last three days of the quarter. At the media and entertainment distribution segment third quarter revenues increased by over $1.4 billion versus the prior year and operating income decreased by $645 million as an increase at linear networks was more than offset by declines at direct-to-consumer and content sales licensing and other. Linear Networks operating income in the quarter increased 13% to approximately $2.5 billion driven primarily by growth at our domestic channels. The increase at domestic channels reflects double-digit percentage operating income growth at both cable and broadcasting.

Growth at cable was largely driven by higher advertising revenue and to a lesser extent a decrease in marketing costs and an increase in affiliate revenue. Advertising revenue at cable benefited from the timing of the NBA Finals which represented six of the top seven telecasts among the coveted P18 to 49 demo across all networks this quarter. Note that the final aired in the third quarter this year versus the fourth quarter of the prior year. This timing impact in addition to the benefit of adding the NHL to our portfolio and strong pricing from the continued strength of live sports drove ESPN advertising revenue growth of nearly 40% year over year.

Demand for live sports remains strong. However due to the NBA Finals' timing impact fourth quarter-to-date domestic cash advertising sales at ESPN are currently pacing down. Moving on to Broadcasting. Operating income increased versus the prior year due to higher results at both ABC and our owned television stations.

Total domestic affiliate revenue increased by 2% in the quarter. This was driven by six points of growth from higher rates partially offset by a three-point decrease from fewer subscribers. International channels' operating income was comparable to the prior year reflecting increased sports programming costs partially offset by advertising revenue growth. Both of these trends were driven by the airing of 35 additional IPL cricket matches in the third quarter versus the prior year.

Note that results also benefited from the closure of certain channels over the past year. At direct to consumer lower operating results across Disney+ Hulu and ESPN+ reflect increased programming and production costs in line with the guidance we gave last quarter as we continue to strategically invest in our streaming businesses. At Disney+ we crossed the 150 million subscriber milestone and ended the third quarter with more than 152 million global paid subscribers a net addition of more than 14 million subs versus Q2. Strong Disney+ core net subscriber additions of 6 million reflect growth in existing markets as well as launches in over 50 new markets during the quarter and we currently expect Disney+ core net additions in the fourth quarter to accelerate modestly versus Q3 and particularly in the domestic market.

At Disney+ Hotstar subscribers increased by over 8 million as the IPO concluded its 15th season in the quarter. Hulu added more than 600000 subs during the quarter and ended the third quarter with 46.2 million paid subscribers and ESPN+ ended Q3 with 22.8 million paid subscribers a net increase of about 0.5 million versus Q2. At content sales licensing and other operating results decreased in line with our expectations by about $160 million versus the prior year quarter reflecting an unfavorable foreign exchange impact and lower TV/SVOD and home entertainment distribution results partially offset by higher stage play and theatrical results. As it relates to foreign exchange note that the overall impact to the company's segment operating income was only modestly negative in the quarter as our FX hedging program continued to be effective in mitigating the impact that changes exchange rates have on our businesses.

As we continue to scale back on third-party content licensing we believe content sales licensing and other results will continue to face headwinds and expect fourth quarter operating results will decrease versus the prior year by close to $100 million. Cash content spend across the company is now expected to total approximately $30 billion for fiscal 2022. This estimate is slightly lower than our previous guidance largely due to timing changes and we expect annual cash content spend over the next couple of years to be roughly in the low $30 billion range as well. We are also revising our full year forecast for capital expenditures to $5 billion compared to fiscal 2021 capex of $3.6 billion.

Our new expectation for 2022 is roughly $500 million lower than our previous guide in part reflecting timing shifts of various projects across the company. Finally before we move to Q&A I want to spend some time sharing a few updates on our fiscal 2024 guidance for Disney+. We are providing more detail on subscriber targets by separating our guidance into two categories: core Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar. Excluding the impact of any significant future macro headwinds our core Disney+ subscriber target range is 135 million to 165 million by the end of fiscal 2024 largely consistent with previously provided guidance that non-Hotstar Disney+ subscribers in 2024 would approximate 60% to 70% of the expected 230 million to 260 million total subscriber base.

We are however updating subscriber guidance for Disney+ Hotstar to up to 80 million subscribers by the end of fiscal 2024. We intend to refine this target over time as subscriber visibility in India will be clearer once the ICC and BCCI cricket rights sales processes are completed. As you may know we recently made the disciplined decision to not proceed with the Indian Premier League digital rights and we'll evaluate these rights with that same discipline. As we sit here today we remain confident that Disney+ will achieve profitability in fiscal 2024 and look forward to several upcoming catalysts including reaching a steady state of tent pole original content releases delivery of premium general entertainment and international local originals and the upcoming launch of our ad-supported tier alongside the new pricing structure announced earlier today.

And with that I'll turn it back to Alexia and we would be happy to take your questions.

[Operator instructions] And the first question will be from Doug Mitchelson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

Doug Mitchelson -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

Thanks so much. One question there was so much to ask about. Why don't I go with this and I do appreciate you separating out the guidance between Hotstar and core Disney but parks were impressive this quarter. And as you talked about levers if demand were to shift is the company satisfied pent-up demand from the pandemic at the parks' point? Should we look at the go-forward basis is relatively normal trends? And I'm guessing you have a different answer for domestic versus international.

And Christine I'd be curious if you'd put any meat on the bone regarding the levers if demand were to shift at the parks.

Christine McCarthy -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Sure. Thanks Doug. Our parks certainly did have a fantastic quarter. And I just want to say that the parks team is the same team led by Josh D'Amaro that was able to manage through the COVID crisis that impacted the business significantly.

They also were able to ramp back in on a very phased basis back to the recovery phase and they're now positioned for growth. So I just want to acknowledge that team for being sort of a triple threat when it comes to being able to manage from very very different vantage points based on the environment. As it relates to levers of demand some of the things we could do Doug we had limited the number of annual passes that we have across some of our businesses -- some of the parks. And all of those come with some -- with the exception of the highest tiered priced annual passes.

They all come with some blackout dates. So to the extent to which perhaps you had lightened demand you could loosen up some of those to bring more people in the park and just enjoy the park and spend money while they're there. And also as it relates to demand we have not yet seen demand abate at all. And we still have many days when people cannot get reservations.

So we're still seeing demand in excess of the reservations that we are making available for our guests.

Operator

Thank you. And the next question will be from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Ben Swinburne -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Bob can you talk a little bit about sort of the research and insight you have into your streaming customer base that sort of informs the decision to take these price increases which on a percentage basis are pretty large without really reducing net adds with from churn spiking as you implement these price increases? And maybe talk a little bit about how the product that consumers will be paying for next year at these higher prices will compare to this year. And I'm just wondering are you planning to take similar pricing moves at least directionally outside the US over time.

Bob Chapek -- Chief Executive Officer

Well as you know we launched at an extraordinarily compelling price across all the platforms that we have for streaming. I think it was easy to say that we're probably the best value in streaming. And since that initial launch we've continued to invest handsomely in our content as you know. We believe because the increase in the investment over the past two and a half years relative to a very good price point that we have plenty of room on price value.

And we do not believe that there's going to be any meaningful long-term impact on our churn as a result. I mean one only needs to look at our recent significant increase on ESPN+ which had the exact same impact of really no meaningful impact at all on our churn. And we believe that we've got plenty of price value room left to go.

Alexia Quadrani -- Senior Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you. Next question.

Operator

Thank you. And the next question will come from Steven Cahall from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.

Steven Cahall -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Thanks. So the DPEP margins were really spectacular. I'm just wondering what kind of trends you're seeing from international visitations. Were those strong in the quarter or is that a tailwind to either per caps or hotel occupancy as you get into the back half of the year and you see more international traffic?

Christine McCarthy -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

I'll take that one Steve. The DPEP margins were indeed very strong. One of the things that we've seen is during the pandemic international visitation to our domestic park primarily Walt Disney World was basically nonexistent. That has proceeded come back and it has come back very nicely but it is still below the traditional range that we've given you which is around 17% 18% up to the low 20s.

But it's made significant progress and we expect the international visitation when it is fully back to actually be additive to margins because those guests tend to stay longer at the parks and they spend more money when they're there as well.

Alexia Quadrani -- Senior Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you. Next question.

The next question is from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.

Michael Nathanson -- MoffettNathanson -- Analyst

Thank you. I just wanted to dig a bit on the ad product at Disney+. What's your expectation for ad load or monetization per sub given there's a $3 difference between the premium with no ads and the ad product and maybe what you've learned from Hulu over the years that informs your expectations on monetization.

Bob Chapek -- Chief Executive Officer

As you know we've had a lot of experience with this on Hulu and a lot of success with this on Hulu. And we are walking before we run in terms of seeing what the market will bear in terms of an ad load. So we're going in very conservative upfront. But we believe that there's probably going to be some more ultimate elasticity in that as well as we go forward.

And we're just really thrilled that we're able to launch the Disney+ ad tier and expand our audience access through all these multiple price points that we're going to have. And as Christine had alluded to the advertising demand since the launch of Disney+ is great. And we think that by taking a conservative approach in terms of that ad load upfront it will give us the ability to expand if we need to and not have to go the other way which I think would be a much bigger deal.

Christine McCarthy -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

And the only other thing I'd add to that Michael is based on our Hulu experience that even current subscribers who have ad-free may choose to stay at the same price point with ads. But the Hulu ad-supported tier has more subscribers than the ad-free. In fact it's well over about -- it's about two-thirds. And that's something that we can't anticipate that we'd have exactly the same behavior because it's a different demo that has Disney+ versus Hulu but that's the best indication that we have.

But we expect the ad tier to be popular and we also expect some people to want to stay with ad-free.

Alexia Quadrani -- Senior Vice President of Investor Relations

And that question will come from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Jessica Reif -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Thank you. Maybe switching gears a little bit to sports. Can you give us your thoughts on what the structure of an NBA renewal might look like? Would it be different? And in the past you've mentioned participating in sports betting. You have the best brand name.

Can you maybe elaborate a little bit on timing of what you're thinking? And then just a follow-up to some of the comments. You launched a new cruise ship; can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of cruise demand overall?

Bob Chapek -- Chief Executive Officer

I think you want to divide yourself. OK. I'll talk about the MBA first. As you know we've had a great history with the NBA.

Really proud of our partnership there. And the past season and the ratings for the finals have been absolutely extraordinary. So we're interested in a renewal with the NBA. But like all of our decisions that we make in terms of content we'll only do it if it's accretive to shareholder value.

And I think that remains the overall guidance whether you're talking about India with IPL whether you're talking about college sports whether you're talking about Formula One racing or you're talking about NBA. So we have an interest to do that. We're really happy with our portfolio of sports rights that we have. But of course the continued relationship with the NBA would be something that would be very attractive to us.

Christine McCarthy -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Do you want to take sports betting?

Bob Chapek -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Well in terms of sports betting we have been in conversations for quite a long time now with a number of different platforms to add some utility to sports betting and take away some friction for that for our guests. We have found that basically our sports fans that are under 30 absolutely require this type of utility in the overall portfolio of what ESPN offers. So we think it's important.

We're working hard on it and we hope to have something to announce in the future in terms of a partnership there that will allow us to access that revenue stream and also make sure that our guests are being -- having their needs met.

Christine McCarthy -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

So Jessica on cruise. As you know we welcomed our fifth ship to our four-ship fleet so we now have five. The new ship goes by the name of Wish as Bob mentioned and it's quite an extraordinary vessel. But we've always said that that business has been the most severely impacted by COVID in terms of duration of disruption to the business.

So we're still coming out of that but we are focused on the business recovering. Historically the cruise line has been terrific with really attractive ROICs for us and it's generated double-digit returns on the investment. And we expect that business to come back to the similarly attractive returns that we had previously experienced. And a couple of things.

The Wish is our newest ship and that has gone with very very high capacity. And that one it's just very well received. But we have a competitive position overall in the cruise business especially the family cruise market. So we generate pricing that's well above the industry average.

And our cruise ships deliver for us one of the highest rated guest experiences across all of our parks and experiences offerings. And this is a really interesting comment that we received from our cruise passengers. 40% of them say that they would not have chosen to go on a cruise vacation if it weren't a Disney Cruise. So we're a unique product and we're still a relatively small share of the cruise market and we're positioned for growth.

And the other four ships are all sailing and their occupancy is improving week by week.

Next question is from Kutgun Maral from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Kutgun Maral -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

Great. Thanks for taking the questions. One on the parks and then a follow-up on FX if I could. First the parks are going through a particularly innovative and transformative period given your investments in technology digital tools and improvements in the guest experience.

So from the outside it seems that the business is as well positioned as it's ever been in the face of a potential recession. But I'd love to get your views on the various sensitivities associated with what the consumer is seeing and how you'd characterize the resiliency of the business. I know you talked about different levers at your disposal but perhaps there's been a structural change in the business compared to prior recessionary periods that you could speak to? And then Christine if I could follow up on your foreign exchange commentary. Can you share a bit more on how you manage your FX risk? And what was the impact of FX on DTC ARPU?

Bob Chapek -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. I think a lot of onlookers look at our park business and try to sum up our success recently and say that it has something to do with pent-up demand. And certainly there is pent-up demand. But what we're seeing is far more resilient far more long lasting in terms of increase in the affinity for our parks both from the willingness to come to our parks and its attendance but also in terms of what guests are willing to spend when they get there in order to personalize their experience.

As you know everything we do in our parks is all about improving the guest experience. And part of that has to do with limiting capacity but also about personalizing those experiences. So we believe we do have a lot of flexibility to shift if our demand changes. Remember we have a reservation system which now enables us essentially real time on the fly to change whatever factors we need in terms of our ticket packaging that we want where years ago we didn't have that.

We published our prices by the quarter and that was essentially all the flexibility we had. But as you know our business looks very strong with forward-looking bookings and intent at pre-pandemic levels and we see nothing in the future that's indicating anything to the contrary of what we've seen. So we're very pleased with that. I should also remind you that our reservation system really does a great job at spreading demand.

So if we see any spikiness we can actually smooth that in a way that we couldn't before. And we're real pleased with that because even our Genie product which as you know we released just a little bit short of a year ago now about 50% of the people that come through the gate actually buy up to that Genie product which I think you can see the result of in our yields.

Christine McCarthy -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

And I'll take the question on foreign exchange and the way we hedge. So we do have a hedging policy that is well established and has really served the company well over very volatile foreign exchange markets. So just level set we have a program and the goal of it is to reduce the impact that changes in foreign exchange rates have on our current and future earnings. So we really have an objective of trying to attain earnings and cash flow stability and predictability.

So we try to take out the ups and the downs. So the hedging program it has significantly reduced the negative earnings impact of the strong dollar that we've seen both in the third quarter as well as the fiscal year-to-date. And so despite being economically hedged as it relates to ARPU we do not allocate the hedge gains or losses specifically to ARPU in the various markets. So therefore the reported ARPU for international Disney+ was impacted by the unfavorable exchange rates in the quarter.

Another thing is when you look at content sales and licensing especially if you go back and look at the transcript you'll note that there was a reference to that also being impacted by negative foreign exchange. That was just a balance sheet ineffectiveness. We also hedge the balance sheet. And that had to do more with we based our hedging on forecasted plans.

And if the plans come in stronger and were under-hedged or over-hedged in this case we were -- it did not benefit us because we were hedged the right way for the dollar strengthening but that is a one-timer that should not be repeated. But as it relates to ARPU if you have some volatility you will see it in the ARPU but it nets out as a company overall. As I mentioned in my other comments that this is not a material item for us on a consolidated basis. You just saw it spike out especially in DMED.

And the other thing is we do hedging on a multiyear basis. So we layer in our hedges over a period of time which has really served us well in the current environment.

Alexia Quadrani -- Senior Vice President of Investor Relations

And the next question is from in Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Please go ahead.

Kannan Venkateshwar -- Barclays -- Analyst

Thank you. So maybe Bob from a strategic perspective when you think about sports it does seem like that there are a lot of new entrants. I mean Apple seems to be interested in more and more sports rights. And from your perspective you obviously walked away from the cricket rights in India and it looks like Big Ten may also be going in a different direction.

So when you think about sports strategically given that cord cutting is structural how do you think about this business longer term? Do you really have to own ESPN or get into sports streaming in a much bigger way or invest a lot more? I mean directionally they are opposite obviously from a decision perspective. So it would be great to get a sense for how you're thinking about sports more broadly. And then on the advertising side if I could just ask a bigger picture question around Disney+. From a subscriber base perspective Disney+ is comparable domestically to Hulu and US is the biggest ad market when it comes to the television opportunity.

So when we think about the scale of advertising for Disney+ is Hulu the kind of benchmark we should be thinking about or can Disney+ be much bigger because it is international in scale all those CPMs are much lower outside the US So if you could just help us scale that opportunity that would be great.

Bob Chapek -- Chief Executive Officer

OK. In terms of the strategy on sports we're continually enamored by the power sports in terms of viewership and what it adds to our overall portfolio particularly in an advertising type world. As you know we get strong cash flows on linear and it helps to pay some of the bills in the companies we make some of our significant investments in content and we also like the proposition of growth and expansion on our DTC. In terms of the rights if you look at the college rights we've got the SEC we've got the ACC we've got the Pac-12.

We've got the Big 12. We've got the play off. We've got the most comprehensive programming. So if we don't get rights in every single conference we don't believe that's in any way limiting for us.

But what we're all preparing for is the future of what ESPN would look like in a direct to consumer -- in a true direct-to-consumer fashion. And I think the way that we're looking at this is that we want to proactively prepare for that future without prematurely disrupting the cash flow that we get from the linear networks right now. And as you know we've negotiated flexibility into our rights agreements across the board for any new rights that we have acquired over the last several years. But we're still bullish on sports.

We believe there's tremendous degrees of freedom in terms of what ESPN DTC ultimately looks like. I think we're very proud of what we've done to date on ESPN+ but that no way limits how we envision what true ESPN DTC proposition would look like going into the future.

Christine McCarthy -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Kannan thank you for asking this question about advertising. I know there's been a lot written recently about ad trends. But I just want to start off by saying pacing in our scatter market continues to be solid across streaming sports as well as our broadcast network Now to get to your question about Disney+ AVOD and the scale first of all we are going to launch later this year as Bob said December 8. And we're taking an intentionally limited approach to it meaning we're launching with a lower ad load and a lower frequency than say Hulu.

And so this will ensure a great experience for viewers and these viewers are different then because a lot of them are families and you have a lot of adults at Hulu but it's a different viewing experience. But because of that disciplined lower ad load lower frequency and the strong advertising demand that we've had that translates into some of the industry-leading CPM rates at the most recent upfront for Disney+. And then we look at beyond domestic what we can do internationally. And we plan to go international sometime next year.

And we've built these strong advertising relationships around the world with our previously existing and currently existing linear footprint. So we're confident in our ability to navigate the international advertising marketplace given our depth of knowledge and experience with the traditional linear business. So we really feel well suited to deliver both domestically on Disney+ AVOD as well as international.

And next question is from Phil Cusick from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.

Phil Cusick -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst

Thank you. One and a follow-up on DTC. First Christine there were higher DTC and Disney+ programming costs than we expected this quarter. Can you give us some direction of where to go in the fourth quarter? And when should we expect those Disney+ operating income losses to peak? And then second if you could dig into the guidance to acceleration of subs in the fourth quarter I think that's an acceleration in the total subs and then you set a higher mix of growth toward domestic?

Christine McCarthy -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

OK. Let me start first with the acceleration of subs. I did mention that that we expect acceleration of subs to be -- especially in the domestic market to be modestly above where we are now. But you will see growth in Q4 and we feel good about that because of the content releases we have and just the existing shows that are on.

Peak losses we expect peak losses -- as of today we expect Disney+ to reach peak losses in this current fiscal year '22. So that is something that is consistent with what we've previously said. As it relates to higher costs of content and programming. We have said that we have -- this is a peak year of losses which includes those costs.

But also we expect as we go into developing our full slate that the next quarter you will see a similar increase year over year that you saw this quarter.

And that question is from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Brett Feldman -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Thank you. And if you don't mind I'd like to follow up with the question about the ad experience on Disney+. And it's only two things I was hoping you could comment on. The first is would you expect to potentially display ads alongside any of the content? Some of that content including some of the kids' content I think historically in a linear world didn't necessarily have ads alongside of it.

So I'm just thinking about that element of it. And then secondly you have a competitor that's looking to layer advertising into their product they're suggesting that they're going to somehow do it differently. And I'm just curious as you think about the experience you've had in streaming advertising. Are you mostly going to look to leverage the formats you've used very successfully with Hulu or do you actually think there may be an opportunity to use some innovative new formats on Disney+ for ads?

Bob Chapek -- Chief Executive Officer

I should say that the technology for Disney+ is a completely different platform than the Hulu platform. So while we certainly have tremendous learnings over the years in terms of how to do addressable advertising and we've done that at the advantage of our shareholders' result I will have to say that we are not encumbered by that or in any way limited by what we've done in the past. Therefore we could have an ad proposition as good as the one that we've had on Hulu but it could actually be better because of that different technology platform. So it has the ability to evolve over time much more on the new platform than it does in the old platform.

Christine McCarthy -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

And as it relates to the ad experience Brett it's not all content on Disney+ being treated equally. There will be no ads in kid's profiles or preschool at least at the launch. And so this is going to be done very thoughtfully and looking at the content and also making sure that the advertiser is consistent with the content. Thank you.

Alexia Quadrani -- Senior Vice President of Investor Relations

Operator I think we have time for one more question.

Operator

Sure. And that question is from Bryan Kraft from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

Bryan Kraft -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst

Hi good afternoon. Christine there's been a heavy working capital use year-to-date in fiscal '22 both from cash content cost as well as what we traditionally think about as working capital. Can you just talk about your outlook for the rest of the year and the prospects for some of that reversing in 4Q and to next year? And then I was wondering if you could also comment briefly just on tax. I think you've had an elevated tax rate this year.

You talked about it last quarter. Is that something that's going to extend into 2023? And if you could just provide any color around what some of the factors are driving that?

Christine McCarthy -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So on working capital we have seen net working capital outflows as our businesses are getting back up and running and going back to more normalized operations after they were kind of turned down during the pandemic. And you'll see in this quarter we did generate positive free cash flow of $187 million in the quarter. On taxes our effective -- annual effective tax rate has generally been correlated with the US statutory rate.

But there are a lot of things on a quarterly basis. We call them puts and takes in any given period. And these can lead to these quarterly variances. But we still expect our full year '22 tax rate is going to be somewhat elevated above the US statutory rate similar to what you saw.

And for Q4 it could even be slightly above Q3. As it relates to fiscal '23 we're just working now through our annual operating plan. And I don't want to get too specific today but it's one of the factors we keep a close eye on as it relates to our ability to utilize foreign tax credits. And that ability to utilize foreign tax credits has been the source of some volatility that you've seen especially in Q2 tax rate.

Fast forward to 2022 and Zaslav as CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery is running a scripted powerhouse and betting on movies as a key content engine. But he along with CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels still vows to zag where the industry zigs. “We have no intention of being beholden to anyone in particular or to a specific business model” Zaslav said during an Aug. 4 earnings call. “Simply put: we are open for business.”

As Zaslav detailed that plan includes setting a measured goal for streaming subscribers returning to an emphasis on theatrical releases and even declaring an openness to licensing content to third parties. This strategy positions streaming as just one of many segments of a multifaceted media firm in contrast to Netflix’s all-in model while feeding into the company’s plan to find $3 billion in cost savings. “The reality is this is what Warner needs to do given its financial condition” says analyst Rich Greenfield who runs LightShed Partners. “What Warner does in the future if they can de-lever time will tell.”

As it stands Warner Bros. Discovery has been a merged company for only about four months. In its first report as a combined entity the conglomerate reported second-quarter revenue of $9.8 billion and a loss of $3.4 billion alongside $53 billion in gross debt. (In contrast Netflix’s gross debt at the end of its second quarter was $14.3 billion though it did not have debt related to a merger alongside revenue of $7.97 billion.)

Working within that financial position Zaslav and team are reversing the strategy of his predecessor former WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar who doubled down on streaming by releasing the studio’s entire 2021 film slate on HBO Max at the same time as the theatrical releases amid the COVID pandemic. Using Batgirl as the latest example Zaslav said his team had analyzed the results of this streaming-first experiment but had not been able to find a business case and financial rationale for the strategy.

“We have a different view on the wisdom of releasing direct-to-streaming films and we have taken some aggressive steps to course-correct the previous strategy” Zaslav said. “We will fully embrace theatrical as we believe it creates interest and demand.” As films move from theatrical to streaming and elsewhere “their overall value is elevated elevated elevated” he touted mentioning such recent examples as Elvis and The Batman.

Other cuts have followed similar cost-cutting measures including the axing of animated feature Scoob!: Holiday Haunt the shelving of Wonder Twins another DC film in development and the scrapping of J.J. Abrams’ big-budget streaming series Demimonde.

The theatrical-first model marks a return to Hollywood’s traditional approach of optimizing content distribution and maximizing revenue via various platforms while also serving as counterprogramming to any sector giants that have been putting all their eggs in the streaming basket. Under Zaslav’s plan Warner Bros. Discovery will create a subscription streaming platform combining HBO Max and Discovery+ content set to launch in summer 2023 with plans to launch a free ad-supported service later on.

On this platform the company will continue to spend on programming but at a more measured rate than competitors. Zaslav is highlighting HBO Max (and touting the upcoming launch of Game of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon) as a centerpiece of the platform while also maintaining important brands on the Discovery+ channel including a new cooking game show from Guy Fieri. WBD has outlined a less lofty streaming subscriber growth target of 130 million by 2025 for its planned platform combining HBO Max and Discovery+ than for example Disney which has projected 230 million to 260 million Disney+ subs by 2024.

“We’re not in the business of trying to pick up every sub. We want to make sure we get paid” Zaslav said.

While this may comfort investors who had been wary of subscriber slowdowns amid high content spending on other platforms Greenfield views it as a company “scaling back their ambitions” marking a near-term win for Netflix and others who can afford to continue to invest.

The Warner Bros. Discovery team is also not precious about the content it produces as Zaslav declared that the company will happily sell it to the highest bidder unlike rivals that have increasingly kept their content for themselves and their streaming services. “What is critical to us we are going to keep that exclusively” he said seemingly speaking to the company’s original content as well as its big franchises such as Harry Potter. But content that “could be non­exclusive and have no impact on us we want to monetize that to drive economic value.”

All in all this approach to streaming is “pragmatic in every way imaginable” Moody’s analyst Neil Begley says adding that Zaslav is still protecting the company’s biggest brands while also using them to help fund the new offerings. “They need that cash flow to fund the transition of the distribution of their content” to various platforms.

And with Warner Bros. Discovery’s financial position which includes a reliance on its legacy TV business a more cautious push into streaming is necessary MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman argued in a report. Mentioning the company’s lowered 2023 earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization guidance of $12 billion-plus down from $14 billion previously he said that this “highlights WBD’s deep dependence on profits from linear cable networks that are under increasing pressure in a declining pay TV ecosystem.” All of this doubles down on Zaslav’s cash-flow-first strategy a profit metric showing the ability to fund operations without external financing.

The question is: Will it work?

It may be too soon to tell Begley says. However the conglomerate has an experienced management team and assets in place that should help the team create another competitive top-tier streaming platform despite any financial headwinds the analyst notes.

For now Cowen analyst Doug Creutz argued that this strategy should endear the company to those spooked by recent streaming subscriber growth challenges for Netflix and others. “The fact that WBD management is so clearly laser-focused on managing the business for free cash flow generation over the long term will only make shares more attractive to value-oriented investors” Creutz wrote in an Aug. 5 report “particularly compared to other media names that still seem somewhat unsure about whether top-line growth or bottom-line performance is the more important metric.”

According one report All Elite Wrestling’s network partner may own a library of WCW themes from a bygone era.

In a report from Fightful Select wrestling legend Jimmy Hart reveals his belief that Warner Brothers Discovery continues to own the rights to over 100 WCW songs to this day.

Hart claims that there is still an entire catalog of WCW themes that were owned by Warner Brothers now the post-merger entertainment giant Warner Brothers Discovery.

Jimmy says that the catalog includes many WCW themes that made it to television as well as unreleased songs too specifically noting his belief that Raven and Saturn’s themes were included in this catalog maintained by WBD.

Hart said to Fightful:

“Well you know what’s really strange? It turned out great but they still got all of our songs down there with their publishing company. They never released anything. So there’s a hundred and something songs just sitting down there waiting for somebody to use them. That was owned by Turner. WCW has them but when Vince bought all the tapes up here in WWE they didn’t get the rights to the music. “They’re all individual tracks that I guess if anybody wanted to use them if Turner and them even have a publishing company who knows what they have down there?”

According to Fightful’s report AEW and their music department are at least aware of Jimmy Hart’s claims.

WM,Waste Management,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29hc3RuZXdzLmNvbS9jYXJsc2JhZC1yZXNpZGVudHMtc3RpbGwtZ3JhcHBsaW5nLXdpdGgtbmV3LXRyYXNoLXNlcnZpY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carlsbad residents still grappling with new trash service,"CARLSBAD — First-time customers of Republic Services continue to report a bumpy transition amid the trash provider’s service rollout in Carlsbad.

Over the past several weeks frustrated customers have fumed on social media about the Texas-based company’s apparent lack of customer service mandatory organic waste requirements (Senate Bill 1383) and new “flimsy” city-owned trash bins. Many were also confused and angry after reporting a 20% rate increase on their first bill from the waste hauler.

The Carlsbad City Council awarded Republic Services a 10-year $270 million waste contract in April 2021 to replace Waste Management the city’s previous waste removal company.

Michelle Trostler who lives in south Carlsbad said she expected a rate increase from Republic Services due to increases in labor fuel and other necessities. However Trostler has reported problems with the company’s customer service and difficulty accessing the autopay billing system among other issues.

Trostler said she’s tried for nearly two months to get a smaller recycling bin since her son left for college. She’s contacted the company at least four times put out the bins for them to collect and even tried waving down a passing employee — all to no avail.

“Some people are screaming about totally illegitimate things and others screaming about legitimate things” Trostler said. “I think the city could’ve communicated it 10 times and maybe that would’ve helped a little bit. But people just throw this kind of stuff away.”

And she’s not alone. Dozens if not hundreds of customers have described similar experiences with Republic Services including going weeks without trash bins difficulty reaching customer service representatives garbage trucks accidentally crushing bins wheels falling off trash receptacles and missing accounts in the company’s service “system.”

Additionally Republic Services has offered a free “kitchen caddy” to customers but Trostler and others have reported difficulties obtaining the complimentary bin after the company reportedly ran out of stock on the first day.

Ryan Egan who lives in Carlsbad Village said bugs flies maggots and other pests had overrun his organic waste bins.

Egan who expressed confusion and frustration over the state’s new organic waste law questioned why the company he’s paying couldn’t sort the trash and organic waste.

“I haven’t seen any benefit from what we had before” Egan said about the transition from Waste Management to Republic Services. “The green waste is the biggest challenge. I want to be better in helping the planet but it’s adding a lot of work for me when it should be on the company to sort that out.”

City Republic responses

In an email to The Coast News Republic Services said residential customers are billed once every two months while commercial and multi-family customers receive a monthly bill.

Jamie Wood the city’s environmental sustainability director and Avecita Jones sustainable materials management program director acknowledged the billing system is a change for customers in the Carlsbad Municipal Water District who for the last 10 years had received a packaged bill from Waste Management and the water district combining their water trash and wastewater services.

In response to complaints over the rate increase the city’s new contract with Republic features several new programs and service options — requested by residents — such as unlimited flattened cardboard and other recyclables outside the cart (recyclables placed inside a separate container). Wood said households also receive a California Redemption Value (CRV) for recycling bottles and cans.

For those who have not yet obtained a kitchen caddy a Republic spokesperson said they are available at the company’s Palomar Transfer Station at 5960 El Camino Real. The company will also hold three distribution events in the coming weeks and giveaway the bins at various events in the future.

“The optimal way to use the kitchen caddy is to line it with paper (such as newspaper paper bag or paper towels) layer in food scraps and then cover with another layer of paper” the company spokesperson wrote. “Do this until full and then take to your green bin outside. Some best places to store kitchen caddies include the refrigerator freezer or under the sink.”

For customers reporting abandoned Waste Management trash bins at their homes Jones said the city asked Republic to do route checks and collect the old containers through the company’s subcontractor.

The ownership of the bins is a bit complex. Republic paid for the new containers but the city owns them. Moving forward each container will be assigned to an address in perpetuity a best practice amongst other municipalities also known as “address “owning.”

Wood said there would be no swapping out bins if the city changed service providers in another 10 years.

“Now as part of the contract the bins will stay with the homeowner” Wood said. “We don’t have to do a full city changeover. We’re trying to keep it from happening again.”

Bins are colored blue gray and green as required by state law so residents can quickly identify the proper container for trash recycling and organic waste. The bins are 30% recycled plastic part of Republic Services’ effort to be more environmentally responsible. Republic will replace damaged carts at no cost to customers.

“We are confident the carts will hold up over time and continue to monitor and adjust the hydraulic arms our new fleet uses for collection” the company said. “If a cart is damaged customers can call customer service at 760-332-6464 to schedule an exchange.”

LaTourette today testified before a joint meeting of the Senate Environment and Energy Committee and the Assembly Environment and Solid Waste Committee about the importance of addressing climate change and coastal resilience in New Jersey.

Commissioner LaTourette was one of several speakers to address both committees on what the state can do to address the worsening effects of climate change.

Commissioner LaTourette’s remarks as prepared:

Introduction

Climate change is the single greatest threat to our communities economies and way of life in New Jersey. In its Sixth Assessment Report last year the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) explained in no uncertain terms that climate change is happening now and that its effects will continue to worsen due to the greenhouse gases humankind has already emitted and continues to emit into the atmosphere.1 The IPCC’s 2021 report echoes the findings of our own Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) in the 2020 New Jersey-specific Scientific Report on Climate Change because the science is clear: temperatures are increasing sea-levels are rising and extreme weather is becoming more frequent and intense.2

We must make faster and more considerable changes to reduce global emissions of climate pollutants. What both committees and all government officials must understand however is that because of our past and existing emissions the climate risks facing New Jersey will only worsen in the years ahead with devastating impacts to our communities economy public health and the daily lives of our residents if we are not prepared. All levels of government must act with concerted urgency to help communities adapt to the realities of climate change.

Both committees are convening almost one year after the remnants of Tropical Storm Ida brought New Jersey the deadliest floods in recent history. Thirty precious lives were needlessly lost. And as we sit here the State is experiencing its fourth heat wave of the season and just this week I declared a statewide drought watch. These alarming conditions are precisely what climate scientists including those at DEP have been projecting and warning policymakers about. New Jersey’s changing climate is forcing residents and businesses to grapple with a world of worsening extremes: periods of incredibly hot dry conditions that stress our water supplies crop yield and public health situated between periods of frequent and intense rainfalls that overwhelm our aging and undersized infrastructure causing extreme flooding destroying property and costing lives.

Events within the last two months alone should make it obvious that our state is struggling to reckon with the reality of climate change: (1) the sudden floods that struck Bergen County amid pre-drought conditions last month (2) the arid conditions that are diminishing crop yield in farm-rich Salem County right now (3) the largest wildfire in over a decade that destroyed over 15000 acres in the Pinelands this June and (4) the nine-mile-long harmful algal bloom that is infecting the Millstone River and complicating drinking water supplies in Central Jersey.

We are not yet ready. But empowered by sound science and a willingness to make wise changes we can get ready and help our communities residents and businesses become more resilient to the continuing climate changes that lie ahead.

Given the coming anniversary of Ida let us honor those thirty lives we so needlessly lost and focus today on just one of these climate resilience challenges: extreme weather and flooding.

Reducing Climate Change Risks from Inland Flooding and Sea-level Rise

Remnants of Tropical Storm Ida

Ida wrought widespread destruction upon the State of New Jersey resulting in losses of life property and significant damage to homes communities businesses infrastructure and other public and private assets in more than half of New Jersey’s counties. The storm produced devastating tornados in central and southern New Jersey and extreme amounts of rainfall and flooding especially in the northern areas of the State. Rainfall totals from the remnants of Ida exceeded prior monthly precipitation averages by two to three times in many places. Several municipalities recorded more than 10 inches of rain over the course of the storm event and six rainfall gauge stations exceeded 6.51 inches of rainfall over a three-hour interval meeting or exceeding the 500-year average recurrence interval at these gauge locations for this short-duration and intense precipitation event.3 In Newark the State’s most populous city with approximately 280000 residents communities suffered over 8 inches of rainfall—more than double the expected monthly rainfall—with 3.65 inches of rain falling in one hour. Ten other weather stations in New Jersey exceeded an hourly precipitation rate of 2.50 inches during this storm.

These staggering rainfall totals the bulk of which occurred over a six-hour period caused creeks and rivers to rise and overtop and overwhelmed inadequate stormwater management systems with damaging and tragic results to public health welfare and safety across the state. Thirty lives were lost residents reported injuries and buildings and infrastructure were severely damaged—some beyond repair. Numerous people were stranded in homes and many businesses were shuttered for extended periods of time. Dangerous flash flooding conditions left motorists stranded in flood waters. Emergency responders risked their lives to protect those threatened by floodwaters. The thirty New Jersey residents lost to Ida the majority to drowning made this the State’s second deadliest natural disaster in the past century.

Ida was not an anomaly. It was a continuation of a pattern of worsening climate impacts. Immediately preceding Ida in August 2021 we had the remnants of Tropical Storm Fred and Tropical Depression Henri both of which resulted in significant rainfall throughout the State. And just before those New Jersey experienced the wettest July since 1975 and second wettest July in almost 50 years with rain totals averaging 3.44 inches above normal in northern New Jersey and 2.62 inches above normal in the southern counties according to the State Climatologist.

Regulatory Reform to Reduce Risks of Inland Flooding and Sea-Level Rise

As of 2019 New Jersey ranked third in the nation in claims paid by the Federal Emergency Management Agency since 1978 with $5.8 billion in total flood insurance claims.4 However flood risk extends beyond the boundaries mapped by FEMA with 38.5% of claims from Henri and 31% of claims from Ida originating outside of the FEMA designated areas. Flood damage is not neatly confined to areas previously understood to be at risk in part because the last data point used to determine flood risk is from 1999. The reality is that current methodologies for determining flood hazard areas and managing stormwater are inherently backward-looking. The precipitation data that drives development and infrastructure does not account for either current conditions or the expected impacts of climate change on precipitation events.

Recent analyses of New Jersey-specific precipitation data confirms that annual and short-duration intense precipitation is increasing across New Jersey and will continue to increase through the end of the century.5 Since 1999 New Jersey has experienced an increase in precipitation between 2 and 10 percent which varies geographically. Projecting forward the increase will grow from 20 to 50 percent more precipitation in the coming decades.

Early in his administration Governor Phil Murphy recognized that the State must take deliberate action to ensure that climate risks were better understood and reduced. Under Executive Order 100 the Governor charged DEP with updating environmental land use rules under a regulatory reform initiative that we call Resilient Environments and Landscapes or REAL—a component of our New Jersey Protecting Against Climate Threats (NJPACT) initiative. The REAL reforms acknowledge that our state’s rules flood hazard and stormwater management rules are based on obsolete precipitation data and do not account for sea-level rise. In the absence of amendments to these rules the reconstruction of storm-damaged buildings and infrastructure as well as new investments in private and public assets would be constructed to standards that are already outdated and will only become more so as the State’s flood risks continue to worsen. This would leave New Jersey residents vulnerable to harm and new investments subject to continued repetitive loss.

As New Jersey continues to experience increases in inland flooding as seen during Ida our coastal areas are at greater risk from sea-level rise and storm surge. In fact sea levels are increasing at a greater rate in New Jersey than most other parts of the world. It is likely that sea-level rise will meet or exceed 2.1 feet by 2050 and increase to 5.1 feet by the end of the century. “Sunny-day flooding” will occur more often across the entire coastal area with Atlantic City experiencing “sunny-day flooding” 95 days a year and a 50 percent chance it will experience 355 days a year by 2100.

Increases in extreme precipitation sea-level rise and storm surge represent a significant additional risk that our residents will face within the life of a typical mortgage. These risks will only grow in the years to come and we are not prepared. Especially as we greet considerable new investment from the federal Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and anticipated ancillary growth we must ensure that our investments are built to stand the test of time amidst a changing climate.

This is the spirit and intent that underlies DEP’s regulatory efforts. When complete the REAL rules will help ensure that both inland and coastal flood hazard areas are better delineated and that new and reconstructed assets in these areas are designed and constructed using the best available climate-informed precipitation and sea-level rise data to adequately protect our assets economy and above all our people from the catastrophic effects of worsening flooding.

New Jersey Must Invest in a Network of Climate Resilience Solutions

It is important that both committees all levels of government and the public understand that there is no one silver bullet that will protect every community from the increasing risks of climate change extreme weather and flooding. There is however a network of solutions that will ensure the resilience of our communities and economies in the face of a changing climate.

In short the resilience menu is large and we must invest in each course. The answer to our flooding and water quality challenges lies in improving the management of our interconnected watersheds. How we develop conserve and manage property and the water that runs off it has implications for our neighbors. Our penchant for focusing on single-lot developments often leads us to take this connectivity for granted with sometimes significant consequences for both flood risk and water quality as we saw with Ida. Management practices that see beyond property and municipal boundaries like regional watershed planning and the establishment of stormwater utilities are one of our best defenses against flooding. But the benefits do not stop there. These initiatives leverage the connectedness of our communities and environment to reduce polluted surface runoff that impairs our drinking water sources diminishes recreational opportunities and harms waterfront businesses that rely on pristine waters that drive tourism.

Moving forward the State’s climate resilience efforts must focus on at least four key areas:

Engineered & Natural Resilience Infrastructure. Working with the Army Corps of Engineers the State must continue to match and facilitate new federal investments in flood control infrastructure. For example the federal government recently committed more than $1 billion in the study design and construction of hard infrastructure projects in some of New Jersey’s most flood-prone watersheds. And the Fiscal Year 2023 budget includes more than $60 million for continued investments in shore protection and flood control projects. Yet these infrastructure projects represent an overall small amount of protection in few places and they will take many years even decades to complete at tremendous cost. We cannot rely on hard flood control infrastructure or beach replenishment alone to meet our climate resilience needs. We need buy-in and participation from each municipality to undertake localized action that best fits the needs of their community. We must also protect and enhance the resilience of our ecological systems which not only provide us with benefits like reduced flooding weakened wave force reduced heat and carbon absorption but also provide critical habitat and resources that are vital to the well-being of the State’s biodiversity. Climate Resilience Planning. To truly address our resilience needs we must engage in climate resilience planning at the regional and community levels. This requires more planning resources to support the development of community-specific science-based strategies and actions that will protect homes businesses critical infrastructure and natural resources. Holistic climate resilience planning will enable communities to identify where financial resources are best deployed including where flood infrastructure stormwater improvements or Blue Acres buyouts would be best positioned in a given community. Blue Acres Buyouts. We must continue to support the DEP Blue Acres Buyout Program and ensure that it is used not only as a reactive disaster recovery tool but proactively to help to get families out of harm’s way while creating more storage for increasing flood waters which can have dual benefits for communities as new parklands or open space. Modernizing Flood Standards and Stormwater Management. As discussed we must ensure that new investments in buildings and infrastructure will stand the test of time and a changing climate by modernizing the state’s flood hazard and stormwater rules. In addition consistent ongoing investment in right-sizing stormwater infrastructure will ensure that communities withstand the bigger storms of today and tomorrow. This includes the adoption of stormwater utilities building green infrastructure enhancing existing infrastructure and restoring riparian areas.

Through climate resilience planning wise investment and supportive regulatory reform we can help all New Jersey communities face the challenges before us. But to meaningfully confront them leaders must focus on the long-term growth and protection of our communities. We must commit ourselves to actions and investments that will take time to show their benefits—just as a warming climate took time to show us its fury. We must acknowledge that it may not be possible to measure our success in the next budget or on the next ballot. We must have confidence that our success will be measured in the safety security and resilience we leave our children and the communities they inherit.

With the expansion of fast-fashion companies and the demand for trendy clothing growing every day a company such as FABSCRAP coming alongside corporations to responsibly handle textile waste is more needed than ever.

Through their work materials that traditionally would have gone to landfill are being properly recycled and made available for reuse.

Their volunteer network has grown from just crafters to anyone with a passion to help the industry become more sustainable. FABSCRAP provides convenient pickup and recycling of textiles for businesses in New York City and Philadelphia.

Schreiber and Tagle met with the Impact Report to discuss their careers in waste management and fashion textile waste from mills to landfills and to tell us about their new FABSCRAP Philadelphia location.

Read more about their impact in their most recent report: FABSCRAP 2020 Annual Report.

Adam Rozenberg: As co-founders of FABSCRAP what was your inspiration for starting an operation like this?

Jessica Schreiber: My background is in waste management. I studied climate science at Columbia and then interned at the New York City Department of Sanitation when they were launching their clothing recycling program Refashion NYC. I was hired to run and grow that program. Then I also moved into E-waste curbside composting and apartment building recycling. So I've kind of worked in waste management throughout my career.

Camille Tagle: My background and career before FABSCRAP was actually in fashion design. I was an evening wear designer and I'm sure you guys can imagine that evening wear in particular is one of the most frivolous categories of apparel and those gowns and those cocktail dresses really are made and designed for just that one occasion and for one use. Most people almost always get a different outfit or dress or gown altogether for a different occasion.

So it was really through that time as a designer that I learned so much more about waste and the impacts and the domino effects of our actions. And I love design it was a great fit for me personally but I think it was just noticing what I was seeing and actually paying attention to what was happening to all these fabrics that were being thrown out season after season even though they were beautiful and perfectly usable. And again working in evening wear you have these really gorgeous silks you have these really time-intensive hand-beaded pieces that are absolutely beautiful and perfectly reusable.

Schreiber: What Camille was experiencing personally I was starting to hear from a lot of brands while I was at sanitation running the city's clothing recycling program. When a fashion company had a question about textile waste it kind of found its way to my desk. And so there were several brands that wanted to know what they should be doing with their textile waste that wasn't clothing yet all of the materials wasted during the design process and it didn't really fit into what I was doing in the post-consumer world like used clothing used home goods used shoes and handbags. This was all raw materials.

And so there were about 30 brands who had the same question and so I pulled them into a working group. And to their credit they very non-competitively shared what the waste was how much they were creating how often and what options they had found for where to send it. And that working group really became sort of the foundation for FABSCRAP. And so it was taking what I knew about the existing nonprofit infrastructure the collections that I was overseeing at sanitation and sort of just tweaking that a little bit so that it could work for businesses and not just for consumers and used goods.

Siri Wilson: Can you talk us through that textile waste management problem a little bit more and actually how much fabric waste happens every year?

Schreiber: I'll start on the post-consumer side because we're most familiar with it. That’s what we wear what we use and then what happens when we're done with it. So post-consumer used clothing home goods shoes and accessories: in New York City just our five boroughs every year we throw out 200000 tons which is a lot of zeroes.

Wilson: And where does it go?

Schreiber: Mostly to landfill.

Tagle: If it's put in the trash it's very rarely pulled out in any kind of usable condition. There's sort of a growing dumpster dive culture where usable things are being pulled out which is great but if it's going into the landfill or if it's going into the trash and then eventually a landfill it's hard to pull it out and save it once it's been put in the trash.

Schreiber: To put that in context 200000 tons is 14 times the weight of the Brooklyn Bridge and we're throwing that out every single year. And that's just New York City and so nationwide I think it's 12.8 million 12.5 million tons. Massive massive amounts of material and in New York it's about 6 percent of the waste stream. So after you address traditional recyclables and then address food waste it's the next biggest part of the waste stream. So it is something that cities that are going Zero Waste are going to have to solve for.

Wilson: For those that don't really know how FABSCRAP works could you just explain it? If someone wanted to get some fabric at FABSCRAP how does that whole process work?

Tagle: I’ll describe a full circle look at our different operations because there are a lot of different ways that people can get involved with us.

At the very beginning is the pickup. So if you imagine how in cardboard or plastic recycling the truck shows up at a business and carts away the waste that's a very similar way in which our pickups work in that we come directly to a designer's studio or office and they have filled bags that we've provided to them with for their textile waste and then we take it to our warehouse. We provide them two types of FABSCRAP bags. One of them is black colored and one of them is brown. The black is for anything that is proprietary in nature so if there is a fabric where a print has a logo designed into it and that's something that they would rather not have the public source and see then that's something that they can choose to put into that black scrap bag so that when it enters our warehouse we know without any question: This is something that has to be sorted by the FABSCRAP team only it can't go into a reuse room like this is definitely proprietary in nature off limits.

We have to be cognizant that there's brands who really want to make changes and take sustainable steps forward. There's also brands that are just looking for the quick fix because they want to say something to customers.

If they do put it into a brown bag then we know volunteers and the public can sort and see. If it's really cool and interesting we can snap a photo and share it with our community. If it's large enough we can put it into our thrift store system for use. So it's a great way to accommodate that very specific creative challenge that a lot of design companies whether it's fashion or interior or entertainment definitely have concerns towards.

Once everything's collected from those brands and it enters or warehouse everything is meticulously weighed and measured and cataloged because as we've talked about there hasn't been any tracking and any data in the commercial sphere and so we feel like that's definitely something that we need to keep track of and understand so that we also understand what our impact is.

So everything is weighed and put into our system and then really at that point it's figuring out ""OK what is inside these bags?"" so that we can figure out how to keep it out of the landfill. So the easier and faster part of it is identifying anything for reuse. Anything that could be put into resale or thrift is anything that's large enough. Usually yardage bigger cuttings that are about 2 yards trims or any sort of embellishments any leather hides yarn cones things like that. Those are pretty easy to identify and separate for reuse. The things that are a little bit more difficult are those sewing scraps that come from actually making the garment or from the cutting rooms. Also headers which are for those who are not as familiar basically fabric swatches that mills will send to design teams as a way to kind of show their fabric collection and try to get orders from designers. A lot of those are a lot smaller and a lot more difficult to be reused. Those we separate by fiber type. And this is important because anything that does not contain spandex actually ends up getting down cycled into different forms of insulation or first shoddy and then the shoddy becomes different types of installation. But that is also really important because we want to track any of the fibers that have potential for fiber recycling.

Wilson: You're opening up a new studio/warehouse in Philadelphia. It's a relationship with Urban and Nordstrom. Can you tell us more?

Schreiber: Our Philadelphia location opens Nov. 15. This happened through a grant from Urban and Nordstrom. Urban had been using our service in New York and shipping their fabric scraps for recycling from Philadelphia where their headquarters are. I think they've been really interested in the model that we're building and the resource that it creates for the creative community and for other fashion companies and they asked ""Do you have any plans for other locations? Would you consider Philadelphia so that we could drop off our waste with you instead of shipping it to New York?"" And so that's sort of how that conversation started.

And then we were working with Nordstrom and they wanted to help support that second location as well. So that grant helped us bring on the transportation company and partner that we're using and launch our partner portal which makes it a lot more convenient and transparent for brands to request pickup and truck pickup and then see all of their data in real time. Between Urban and Nordstrom we're sort of moving in a way of making everything more accessible for brands and for creatives.

Rozenberg: I'm curious to hear more about what your dialogue is like with the people who are supplying the material for you guys.

Schreiber: It runs the gamut. We have to be cognizant that there's brands who really want to make changes and take sustainable steps forward for the good of the industry and they are actually leading in the space. There's also brands that are just looking for the quick fix because they want to say something to customers and we can kind of tell based on how that conversation goes sort of their intention of starting to recycle with us.

Tagle: I will just add to that that the response from the industry has been fairly supportive. It is a mix of how they do feel that pressure from consumers and honestly recycling with us is a very simple step to make that they can call a sustainable step but so much of how our service is set up is literally catered to these businesses and to how they operate. So especially having been a designer you can't ask for more things to be taken care of. We show up at their door. We take care of the transportation we provide a full beautiful data report that summarizes their entire recycling with us and what that means in terms of carbon offset and trees planted and we do a lot of that tracking and that data collection that we mentioned before is something that isn't really top of mind for a lot of these companies.

And then like Jessica mentioned as well if they want to share more about the story and to be more transparent about what happens when they do send their fabric to FABSCRAP then that's definitely a pretty good opportunity for them as well. Factoring in the service costs and like we just mentioned as well is not too far off from what they pay anyway for their trash and recycling. So it's really like Jessica just said breaking it down even further to now there's like a separate category for textiles and so there's really not too much against a company for that decision to recycle with us just because of how we set it up and how our service works.

Earlier this week the city acknowledged the delays and asked customers for their patience.

The Department of Public Works informed residents that due to staffing issues with solid waste contractors — GFL Environmental and Waste Management — some households may have their trash and recycling containers collected one to two days late.

Michelle Pryor moved into her Northwest Detroit neighborhood in 1993. The lawns are kept and folks take pride in where they live.

Her trash was supposed to be collected Monday but when we spoke to her on Thursday it was still there.

""Luckily we live in a neighborhood where people care about their property and they're not letting animals turn the garbage over you know"" Pryor said. ""There were a couple of animals down there and another one over there earlier this week.""

Pryor says trucks came by on Monday but only collected trash on one side of the street.

""I called Monday and they said oh they'll probably be back before the evening"" Pryor said.

Pryor says Waste Management which merged with Advanced Disposal services her area.

She called them four times this week.

""I know everybody is having shortages because of COVID but just tell the community you're not going to get a garbage pickup"" Pryor said.

She is signed up for alerts from the city but after Monday they gave her no updates on when trash pickup would resume.

Ron Brundidge the director of DPW says he's aware of the challenges but that's not an excuse.

He's holding both companies accountable.

""You guys are under contract for another two years of a five-year contract and if you can't quickly get service levels to a point that citizens deserve and require you're putting those existing contracts at risk"" Brundidge said.

About one hour after we spoke to Brudidge and shared Pryor's concerns trucks came through and cleared every bin on the block.

""This is garbage. It should be picked up. There's nobody putting anything illegal out on the street. We have them in the proper containers sitting at the curb waiting for pickup "" Pryor said. ""Monday is our regular day we expect the garbage to be picked up.""

Brundidge says recycling bulk waste and yard waste is collected every other week.

""In any event that a resident chooses to put out an amount that greatly exceeds that two cubic yard capacity our contractors are not required to pick it up"" Brundidge said.

If you aren't sure about what trash will and won't be picked up visit the city's website.

Those who are seeing major delays should reach out to DPW and if it starts piling up 7 Action News wants to hear from you.

The consortium now has approval from the Alaska Department of Natural Resources’ Division of Oil and Gas to drill test wells on the North Slope to confirm the long-term production prospects of methane hydrate. The consortium includes the Japan Oil Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) the US Department of Energy the US Geological Survey and the US National Energy Technology Laboratory.

Methane hydrates also known as methane clathrates are natural gas molecules trapped in ice lattices that form under a specific set of temperature and pressure conditions. They occur both in deep soil and on the ocean floor.

Alaska is one of the only areas with well-characterized and abundant onshore subsurface hydrate deposits close to existing oil and gas infrastructure. In 2018 the US Geological Survey assessed the undiscovered conventional resource potential of methane hydrates on the North Slope to be almost 54 trillion cubic feet of gas. The consortium aims to demonstrate that methane can be consistently produced from a subsurface hydrate formation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vdGhldm9pY2Vidy5jb20vbWlzc2luZy1maXNoZXJtZW5zLWJvZGllcy1yZWNvdmVyZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Missing fishermen's bodies recovered » TheVoiceBW,"After almost 21 days of searching Botswana Police and Botswana Defence Force dive teams have retrieved bodies of two fishermen who drowned in Gaborone Dam.

The two allegedly went missing on the 17th of July after leaving their homes at Old Naledi on a fishing trip to the dam.

The duo – aged 31 and 34 – never returned home and their relatives reported them missing the next day.

A search party was dispatched and their clothes were discovered near the dam and their fishing boat was found stuck in the deep waters.

The suspicion was that the boat had capsized. An intensive search operation started on the 19th of July with divers searching around the stuck boat but with no luck.

The second body was discovered on August 6th the day three Water Utilities Corporation employees drowned at Gaborone Dam 9 years ago.

The three men went missing while testing the water and patrolling the dam.

A search team found the two vehicles the men used to transport their speedboat to the dam and recovered their two petrol containers and cooler box.

Their bodies were recovered after 9 days.

Confirming the recovery of the two bodies Acting Officer Commanding number 13 District Superintendent Joubert Kome said the first body was discovered on Friday floating on waters near Gaborone Yacht Club while the second one was discovered on Saturday 100m away from the other body.

“This has not been an easy search because on somedays there were strong waves and we were forced to call off the search. There are also some obstacles under the waters like trees and woods. The police have since handed the corpses to their families. My advice to fishermen is that they must be able to swim in case of an accident. If you don’t have the skills then you run the risk of drowning. We thank our colleagues from Botswana Defence Force who have been with us since we started the search” said Kome.",,,,,,

The decision still means about $600 million of wholesale gas costs can be passed onto consumers who already have started to pay those amounts through a special surcharge.

The decision by the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to reject about 9% of the costs fell far short of a recommendation by the Minnesota Department of Commerce which represents ratepayers and utility watchdog groups.

Still the PUC's decision was considerably more beneficial to consumers than a ruling earlier this year by two administrative law judges. They found the utilities entirely justified in collecting the full $660 million bill from ratepayers.

""We wish the commission would have gone further — that obviously would have been better for consumers — but at the at the end of the day I am really pleased with how the PUC acted"" said Brian Edstrom senior regulatory advocate for the Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota a ratepayer advocacy group.

Wholesale gas prices in Minnesota and many other states soared in February 2021 when a historic storm hit Texas and other natural gas-producing states. Temperatures plunged gas field equipment froze up and supply cratered just as demand climbed.

Many Minnesotans will pony up 50% more than they pay annually for their heating bills just to cover the storm's gas costs.

Minnesota like many states allows utilities to directly pass wholesale gas price swings to ratepayers. But watchdogs have wondered if because of that rule utilities did not take more evasive actions to manage storm-related costs.

""If utilities' own resources were at risk I think they would have made different decisions"" PUC Commissioner Joe Sullivan said at Thursday's meeting.

Last year the PUC allowed four investor-owned utilities to begin recovering the costs but also opened up an investigation that culminated in Thursday's ruling.

The commission rejected $35.7 million of the $409 million CenterPoint Energy incurred during the storm; $19 million of Xcel Energy's $179 million tab; and $845000 of $8.8 million in costs for Great Plains Natural Gas Co. a small utility in western Minnesota.

MERC an arm of Milwaukee-based WEC Energy Group signed an 11th hour settlement agreement Wednesday that would disallow $3 million of its $65 million in extraordinary gas costs from the storm.

The Commerce Department the Minnesota Attorney General's Office and the Citizens Utility Board signed the settlement. MERC did not admit to any ""imprudence or unreasonable action"" in connection with the February 2021 storm.

The utilities' prudency during the storm was at the heart of the PUC's investigation.

The gas companies said they were acting prudently — given the information they had at the time of the storm — and followed good utility practices.

The AG's office the Commerce Department and the Citizens Utility Board contend the utilities did not act prudently from Feb. 13 to Feb. 17 — and that their mismanagement caused them to rely too much on an overheated spot gas market.

They said the utilities didn't withdraw enough gas from storage depots miscalculated gas supply forecasts and in some cases did not curtail gas to business customers when they should have.

Also CenterPoint and Xcel failed to adequately use backup gas reserves known as peaking plants they said.

For all those reasons the Department of Commerce had recommended that the PUC reject up to $122 million of Xcel's storm-related gas costs; $45 million for CenterPoint; $10.7 million for MERC; and $845000 for Great Plains.

The PUC fully followed Commerce's recommendations only for Great Plains. The PUC disallowed $37.7 million of CenterPoint's costs and about $19 million of Xcel's. All disallowance votes were 4-1 with Commissioner Valerie Means voting against.

Means agreed with the administrative law judges' report to allow the utilities to recover the full $660 million.

""In my opinion the ALJs' report is comprehensive through and through"" Means said. The record ""is replete with evidence to support their recommendations.""

The PUC rejected about $12 million of CenterPoint's costs for not maximizing the amount of gas it had in storage depots. It disallowed another $12.4 million saying that CenterPoint should have used its peaking plant more during the gas crisis.

Peaking plants provide gas reserves during emergencies though CenterPoint and Xcel contend that means only when gas supplies are short not expensive. The PUC disagreed also rejecting $14.7 million in Xcel's costs for failing to use its peaking plant.

Xcel's largest peaking plant in Inver Grove Heights was idled six weeks before the storm after it malfunctioned and twice leaked gas. A cautious Xcel then closed two smaller peaking plants.

Xcel's ""peaking plants should have been available and had they been available they should have been used"" said PUC Commissioner Matt Schuerger.

The Commerce Department had recommended that the PUC disallow $65 million in Xcel's costs due to the peaking plant outage. The PUC may still effectively penalize Xcel further for the disabled peaking plants in the company's current rate case.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL21pbHdhdWtlZS10b29sLW9wZW5zLW5ldy1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLXBsYW50LWluLXdlc3QtYmVuZC0tLTE1MC1uZXctam9icy0zMDE2MDE4OTYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Milwaukee Tool Opens New Manufacturing Plant in West Bend - 150 New Jobs!,"WEST BEND Wis.

Edward A. and Wendy M. Pesicka filed an arbitration claim on October 5 2017 alleging that Gregory T. Pease while affiliated with Wells Fargo Clearing Services and Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network altered the Pesickas’ risk profiles on their account applications “routinely churned” their investments and placed them in investments that exceeded their risk tolerance.

“Claimants allege that many of these investments were made with the sole purpose of generating additional commission or fees in Pease’s favor” states the Aug. 8 award.

The investors accused Wells Fargo Pease Pease’s partner John P. Rauch and Rauch Pease Wealth Management of breach of fiduciary duty fraud negligence unjust enrichment aiding and abetting fraud and conspiracy among other causes of action. Pease was serving as a “discretionary account benefit administrator” during the timeframe of the allegations according to the award document.

A three-person all-public Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Inc. panel based in Pittsburgh found Wells Fargo Clearing Services and Pease jointly and severally liable and awarded the Pesickas $731587 in compensatory damages. Wells Fargo and Pease also must pay 6% annual interest on the award from October 6 2017 through the date the award is paid in full.

Edward A. Pesicka is chief executive of Owens & Minor a health care firm based in the Richmond Virginia area. Attorneys representing the Pesickas did not respond to a request for comment.

A Wells Fargo spokesperson declined to comment.

The Pesickas sought damages of between $6.5 million to $9.4 million and treble damages. They also asked for attorneys’ fees and costs of $1.2 million. The arbitrators denied punitive damages treble damages and attorneys’ fees.

Critical to the College Completion Scholarship Program is a mentorship component facilitated by Mentor Collective. Mentor Collective applies scholarly research on mentorship to purposefully match each scholarship winner with a professional mentor at Wells Fargo. A 2021 study found that young adults with career mentors experienced greater career enhancement and reported higher levels of well-being in the short and long term. Additional research performed across over 700 students in Mentor Collective's programs also show significant improvements in retention and sense of belonging; namely that peer mentorship influenced an average 5.67% increase in year-over-year retention. These results were considerably more profound when students had 3+ conversations with their mentor (average 11.8% increase in retention and 13.39% increase in sense of belonging).

""Social and financial capital are two essential components necessary to help students graduate and transition their learning into a fulfilling career"" said Gigi Dixon Wells Fargo head of external engagement for Diverse Segments Representation and Inclusion . ""We are honored to play a role in empowering the next graduating class with both financial and networking assistance. Through the Mentor Collective program these scholarship recipients will be paired with a Wells Fargo employee to help them navigate the professional landscape beyond their post-secondary career.""

""Through our research and experience with career readiness programs we've found that mentorship at this formative time before graduation not only better prepares students for academia or the workforce it contributes to significant upward movement on the socioeconomic strata"" said Jackson Boyar Co-Founder and CEO of Mentor Collective . ""Wells Fargo has been an incredible partner in helping Mentor Collective reach students with the most to gain from life-changing relationships and we look forward to seeing the impact an initiative like this can make.""

Read more

Kendrick Lamar’s new album Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers plays out like one long self-interrogation a two-volume look inward at the burdens he carries.

That struggle came to South Philadelphia Tuesday night when the Compton Calif. rapper brought his Big Steppers tour to a packed Wells Fargo Center with openers Baby Keem and Tanna Leone both of whom are signed to his pgLang label.

The Pulitzer prize winning rapper’s stunningly stylized headlining set was structured like a 1-hour 45-minute therapy session a 28-song self-examination complete with the voice of a British doctor — was that Helen Mirren? — urging her patient to do the necessary work on himself.

He was working alright. When he last played the Wells Fargo on tour for 2017′s acclaimed Damn. Lamar maintained a minimalist aesthetic eschewing spectacle as if to prove a lone performer could command the attention of an arena-sized space with the force of his intense focus.

Lamar hasn’t compromised his art one iota but with The Big Steppers he’s added a flair for visual presentation creating a theatrical tableau that magnified the internal conflicts playing out in his songs and in his head.

“I hope you find peace in this lifetime” another disembodied woman’s voice intoned at the start of “United in Grief” the set-opening song.

“I’ve been going through something” Lamar’s voice was heard to say as he appeared for the first time rapping while seated at a piano. A ventriloquist’s dummy looked down at him a mini-me Kendrick in matching dark suit and one glittering Michael Jackson-style glove keeping a creepy eye on him.

The set design was wide open and spacious all right angles with a square stage flanked by rectangular video screens that turned into a giant cube when curtains were draped from near the ceiling to the floor.

Lamar spent most of the night alone on stage though he was sometimes accompanied by female and male dancers who joined him in marching formation.

He moved with theatrical flair from the main stage to another platform in the middle of the arena and later yet another one at the far end. He was often dramatically lit from below his giant silhouette appearing on the curtained cube behind him.

The play of light and shadow illuminated the murky world of doubt self-recrimination mourning and healing in Mr. Morale songs like “Rich Spirit” “Father Time” and “Purple Hearts.”

And it was a sight to behold when the 35-year-old Lamar who rapped with trademark precision all night pulled out past hits like “Backseat Freestyle” from 2012′s Good Kid m.a.a.d. City and “King Kunta” from 2015′s To Pimp A Butterfly.

The general admission crowd on the arena floor exploded with energy bouncing about with phones held high capturing every second for posterity.

Probably the most impressive detonation of the evening came after the therapist’s voice issued a warning: “Mr. Lamar once again you’ve let your ego get the best of you. Must I remind you how this went before?”

That was followed by “Humble” from Damn. in a thundering reworked bass-heavy version that shook the room. Lamar addressed himself: “Be humble” he rapped “Bitch sit down.”

The dynamic opening wasn’t quite sustained throughout the set. The staging grew less eye-popping and the choreography settled into more predictable arena spectacle modes.

There were also momentum issues. A late peak of the show came with “Alright” the To Pimp declaration of resilience that became a Black Lives Matter anthem particularly after the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.

The staging was a bit odd. The therapist’s voice announced “Time for a COVID test” and Lamar performed inside a clear plastic cube surrounded by four people in hazmat suits.

Maybe it was meant to be a reassurance that we would be alright coming out of pandemic isolation. Or perhaps it was this: We’re all stuck in isolation with ourselves and unless we undertake the self-examination that’s at the core of Mr. Morale we in fact will not be alright.

In any case it didn’t really matter because even though Lamar was rapping behind a transparent wall the crowd went wild. The song was without question the high energy peak of the latter part of the show. The trouble was that there were seven more to follow which struggled to match that level of excitement.

Lamar closed the show with Mr. Morale’s “Savior” in which he stressed to the crowd that with all his imperfections that’s exactly what he is not. Another voice-over shared wisdom familiar to Spider-Man fans: “With great power comes great responsibility.”

But before that there was one last blast of fun courtesy of Baby Keem. The 21-year- old rapper born Hykeem Carter Jr. who is Lamar’s cousin seemed not quite ready for the big stage when he played the Made in America festival last year.

On Tuesday after an opening set by Leone to which the young crowd politely paid attention Keem was welcomed by passionate chants of his name. He was impressively composed and fans were primed for every track from last year’s The Melodic Blue. And then toward the end of Lamar’s set Keem joined his cousin for “Family Ties” their 2021 duet.

The room lit up as the two faced each other from opposite ends of the arena. Keem thanked his cousin calling him by a family nickname: “I’m grateful to Man-Man for opening the doors.” And Lamar loosened up and boasted: “I’m not a trending topic I’m a prophet .. looking for a better me.” With the Mr. Morale album and The Big Steppers tour that search continues.

Here’s the set list to Lamar’s 1 hour 45 performance which included 28 songs though a few of them were snippets."

Identification and analysis of E&L is complicated – and the challenges aren’t getting any smaller with an increasing diversity of drug modalities. Back in 2006 the Product Quality Research Institute (PQRI) issued recommendations on safety thresholds and best practices for E&Ls in orally inhaled and nasal drug products. Now they have released new recommendations: “Safety Thresholds and Best Demonstrated Practices for Extractables and Leachables in Parenteral Drug Products (Intravenous Subcutaneous and Intramuscular).”

Given the complexity of the topic the document has been years in the making. Here we find out more from Diane Paskiet Director of Scientific Affairs at West Pharmaceutical Services who has been involved with PQRI for nearly 20 years.

How much work went into pulling these recommendations together? And how long did it take?



Developing a comprehensive recommendation document like this takes a long time. In this case we needed nearly 10 years to gather data you need a lot of input – and ultimately consensus on the final document. It’s also worth remembering that PQRI relies on volunteers from industry academia and regulators. To develop the document we had to draw on volunteers with extensive backgrounds in toxicology and analytical chemistry. We had to develop a proposal and work plan and get materials donated from different suppliers. We compiled a database of over 600 extractable and leachable chemicals as part of the safety assessment to support the threshold and we had multiple sub teams that generated data on the donated materials as well as toxicologists who developed the safety thresholds.

Gathering all this evidence and data has been a long journey! Well over a hundred people have been involved with this – which is a lot of people when you need consensus!

How have conversations around primary packaging changed in the last five years?



In general the materials used in pharmaceutical packaging have remained the same for decades except for aluminium silicate glass which is a more recent development that improves strength and reduces the risk of delamination. However drug modalities are changing significantly and we need to know if traditional packaging materials are suitable. In particular biopharmaceuticals can be very sensitive and issues with E&Ls can affect product quality; for example through degradation modification or aggregation. The increase in biologic product diversity and complex dosage forms introduces new risks for safety and compatibility as well as challenges in packaging performance and protection of the contents.

In short we need to consider the fact that traditional packaging solutions were never designed with antibody drug conjugates RNA therapies and other emerging modalities in mind.

Why is it so important to get packaging right?



Treatments and cures would not be possible without the right packaging – or without the right safety and compatibility studies. In some cases you also need a device to administer the drug to the patient. There have been many conversations on the topic focusing on the scientific and regulatory issues surrounding drug-device combinations. The regulation here is evolving all the time. Add to that the fact that there are increasingly complex products coming down company pipelines and you can see there’s still a lot of work to be done in understanding E&L risk.

The science of packaging is always evolving too. I’ve been working in this sector for over 30 years. At the time you always think you know what you need to know but then everything changes; we are continually learning about how drug or biological products may need to be stored protected and delivered. The potential for chemical migration leachable reactivity or surface interaction may not be easily discerned and can affect product quality. The most important thing is to ensure that packaging remains both suitable and safe.

What’s included in the new recommendations?



The document includes a framework for the toxicological evaluation of leachables for parenterals and best practices for the analytical evaluations of E&Ls. Something that we have peppered throughout the document – because it’s so important (and something that the regulators are keen on) – is that drug developers need to engage with regulators early on. There is increasing complexity in both parenteral products and closure systems – and justification and proper documentation are expected including information on thresholds extraction conditions solvents and so on. The E&L analysis should be discussed early with regulators so that drug developers can be sure that the regulators will have the information they will eventually need to review the final drug dossier for approval. You don’t want to get to the end of your drug development program and then find out that there were risks in your packaging and analysis strategy that you overlooked or didn’t approach in the right way.

The paper provides best practices for extraction studies and assessments covering materials for constructing finished components and complete packaging systems.

One of the significant recommendations we make in the paper pertains to the concept of thresholds. There are three thresholds: the safety concern threshold the qualification threshold and the analytical evaluation threshold. The former two are safety related and the latter is for compound identification.

The safety concern threshold (SCT) is 1.5 µg/day and is used to derive the analytical evaluation threshold. The SCT value was justified from the evaluating of over 600 potential leachables using existing toxicological qualification approaches. Below this threshold the dose is so low that the safety concerns should be negligible but that does not guarantee it is safe! The threshold is just for identification and reporting for assessment. Above this threshold you need to identify and assess your leachable for toxicological concerns. There are certain compounds that are known to be a high risk which may be below the analytical evaluation threshold and may need to be specifically sought depending on the material chemistry.

The qualification threshold is recommended at 5 µg/day providing there is no genotoxic or carcinogenic potential but it is important to consider the potential for sensitization and irritation.

The paper provides best practices for extraction studies and assessments covering materials for constructing finished components and complete packaging systems. In the document and supporting publications we show how to generate the extractable profiles and provide key considerations such as the sample of solvent ratio conditions of exposure and technologies for analysis and their sensitivity. Once you have your extractables profile you can evaluate and build out your leachables studies.

Overall it’s a difficult topic to summarize – the science is complex (and the paper is almost 100 pages)! I encourage people to read the recommendations for the full details in the hope that it helps applicants with their E&L studies.

Where else is there room for improvement?



There is always going to be a need for new best practices in this field. Science evolves regulations change and new modalities emerge. One area we are looking at in a focus group is combination products which is tricky because you need to merge together qualification approaches for devices and drugs. We may have future recommendations in this area but the working group is only in the planning stage.

What are the benefits of volunteering for an organization like the PQRI?



For me the knowledge enrichment is very rewarding – and this comes from sharing information and listening to the experience of others. There is a growing diversity in the intended use for packaging and you can’t experience everything yourself – you need to learn from others. For example if you’re working in a packaging company then it’s important to hear opinions from drug manufacturers and vice versa.

The world of E&L is dynamic. Simulation and modelling are emerging and it’s possible that things may look very different five years from now. Even if we look back on the last two years drug development has changed significantly – with new technologies and a move to digitalization. Having more data and being able to assess risks to products and patients early in pharmaceutical development could lead to changes in E&L analysis.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2I2Yjg2YTdkLTc5YzItNDZhMC1hOTU3LWQzOTc0NTI2MDg2MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US poised to negotiate drug prices despite fierce pharma lobbying,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

Meanwhile industry watchers remain divided on the bill’s pros and cons.

Alongside climate and tax measures Sunday’s Congressional package includes provisions that give Medicare the power to slash drug prices and cap out-of-pocket spending for seniors. The bill which still needs to go through the House to become law also requires drugmakers to pay a Medicare rebate if their prices rise faster than the rate of inflation.

Even if the bill passes muster in the House this week as expected the drug price measures will only take effect once the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services rolls out regulations on their execution. At that point pharma companies would be free to sue.

It isn’t so much a question of if drugmakers will mount a legal counterpunch to the legislation but when and how.

The House passing the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 would be “just the beginning rather than the end of developments over Medicare drug price negotiation” Rachel Sachs a law professor at the Washington University in St. Louis wrote in a HealthAffairs summary of the bill’s drug pricing elements.

The pharma industry has suggested it’s likely to sue to challenge the law Sachs explained. Further the industry could angle to influence the rulemaking process and sue to challenge the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ (CMS’) rollout of regulations. Finally the industry “is likely to attempt to ‘game’ the negotiation process itself” Sachs continued.

None of this should come as a shock she added citing the pharma industry’s historical litigiousness when it comes to “even the most moderate price transparency laws.” The industry has a long history of leveraging patent thickets pay-for-delay agreements product hopping and more to keep hold of their product monopolies.

“It would be surprising if this behavior stopped with the enactment of drug price negotiation legislation” Sachs said.

Still the measures—despite their limitations—could change the way Medicare pays for drugs potentially cutting costs for millions of seniors who struggle to afford their prescriptions Sachs said.

Pharma prepares its response

In recent weeks scores of executives from some of the industry’s biggest companies—plus trade groups such as the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA)—have railed against the proposed legislation. PhRMA President and CEO Stephen Ubl on Sunday called the Senate’s decision a “tragic loss for patients” based on a “litany of false promises.”

In one common industry refrain executives and others have argued that the bill doesn't provide for back-and-forth ""negotiations."" Instead since the bill authorizes harsh financial punishments against companies for not complying with Medicare's pricing offers industry advocates say the bill introduces ""price controls.""

In a separate email to Fierce Pharma PhRMA spokesperson Brian Newell said the organization remains “concerned that that the reconciliation bill passed by the Senate fails to help address many of the real affordability challenges facing patients.” PhRMA wants Congress to set its sights on the “unfinished business” of lower cost sharing for patients and pharmacy benefit manager reform he added.

PhRMA is also weighing ways to counter the bill.

“While it’s premature to speculate before the bill has passed we will explore every opportunity—including legislative regulatory and legal—to make sure patients have access to the medicines they need and our industry can continue to develop lifesaving cures and treatments” added another PhRMA spokesperson Sarah Sutton.

A positive outlook

Some drug pricing experts are more positive on the bill which they see as an actual stab at price reform following years of lawmaker bluster and bravado.

Stacie Dusetzina Ph.D. associate professor of health policy and Ingram associate professor of cancer research at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine said in an email that the measures ""are good for Medicare beneficiaries and for taxpayers who fund the Medicare benefit.""

“Though some are disappointed that these provisions apply only to Medicare it is important to realize that this bill substantially improves the health benefits for 48 million people in our county” she added. “I think that is a really big deal.”

The industry has long argued the move could stifle innovation but some experts such as Loren Adler associate director of the University of Southern California-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy say those fears are overblown.

The bill’s effect on new drug development “should be somewhat muted” Adler said. That’s “both because new drugs can offset some (but not all) of the law’s effect on prices by launching with a higher list price than they otherwise would have and because negotiated prices cannot kick in until the drug has already been on the market for 9 to 13 years at which point many drugs would have already begun facing generic competition.”

The reconciliation bill is set to go before the House on Friday. The legislation would allow Medicare to set prices for 10 medicines in 2026 with the number growing to 60 by 2029 analysts with SVB Leerink wrote in a recent note to clients. In 2026 and 2027 Medicare would only control Part D drug prices but in 2028 it could also negotiate prices in Part B the analysts said."

Thank you for sharing a few things I- and anyone with this problem of which there are MANY- can try. I could contribute a very long list of what I've tried sourced from info all over the web- including Apple's support forum threads about this bug- but none of them lead to an actual solution... presumably because this is not a problem users can resolve without Apple fixing something in macOS.I am offended by ""2 year old/pout/whine"" et all. You don't know me my level of technical competence my experience with such things and/or what I have or have not tried as a user to resolve this problem.My original contribution to this thread about ""unexpected ejections"" by others believing it to be focused on WD drives was in a pure spirit of helping consumer-to-consumer... by letting all know that this is aproblem withenclosures/drives not limited to only WD drives. A simple search of ""macOS Monterey Unexpected Ejection"" and similar will lead tothreads all over the web with all kinds of people trying to deal with this. Some of those threads are on Apple's own support forums and some of those have dozens to hundreds of posts.By letting anyone suffering such issues know that this is a BIG problem affecting many- but not all- enclosures drives etc it can save them from doing what I've already done and you wrongly assumed I had not... which was (getting ""off my butt"" to) trysingle thing I could find on the web to resolve the issue myself. I put severalinto this hunting down every ""solution"" testing it as objectively as I could and finding each wasn't a solution. Often it was simpler than that by reading later posts by those who had proclaimed something as solution to then come back rescinding that claim because the problem resumed for them.I make my living on Macs and have very likely been using Macs for much longer than you have. This particular big storage is important to regular work flow tasks so the urgency to ""get off my butt"" was much greater than average Joe with a comparable problem. I was on this on delivery of Mac Studio stock fresh no migration and before anything I might install can get some redirection blame. Having trieda user can try I am near fully convinced thatand hoping that it is not a Silicon hardware issue as those are the only 2 variables that are different in a very simple test:Same cable enclosure drive power source etc rechecked now many times by re-attaching to Intel Macs to be sure it wasn't a coincidently ""gone bad"" scenario... and those 2 bullets absolutely apply. Tested every USB port on the back and front of Studio and even through 3 middleman Thunderbolt enclosures too. I've seen enough posts about this from people with Intel Macs having no issue before ""upgrading"" to Big Sur or Monterey to mostly rule out the Silicon (hardware) being at fault. Thus the one variable that remains is macOS versions newer than Catalina.Intel Macs do not require user Darwin knowledge expansion to yield a stable connection power saver tweaks terminal sudo or kill commands etc. As is the promise of ANY USB device- including ancient ones- U means. It's USB not ""U*SB."" It is supposed to be a ""just works"" plug & play technology.I don't recall ANY case where anything USB- at least a few hundred pieces of third party tech- would NOT just plug & play with all of my many Power PC and then Intel Macs over the years. In fact in trying to objectively diagnose this issue to the limits of my ""2 year old"" brain I dug out ancient USB stuff long-since retired for testing. Much of it ""just works"" including stuff more than 15 years older than the enclosure giving me this problem.This one will remain connected for up to about 3 hours but it will ""unexpectedly eject"" regardless of power setting tweaks: I've tried all such options. As a video editing big scratch drive the primary use is with FCPX. During video work neither it nor Mac could even get into power saving modes. In some cases DURING active file transfer from or to it it will ""unexpectedly eject"" so no power saving code should be in play during direct & obvious active use between both parts. Yes I believe power saving code plays some role here but I am confident it is not solely the source of all of this as active transfer ""unexpected ejections"" clearly illustrate.It is a reliable brand enclosure- OWC- known for making quality Mac peripherals. It's hopefully temporary replacement which does ""just work"" using thecable is also from OWC. I've (hopefully temporarily) given up much more storage and speed for the replacement that does remain stably connected. So one from a reliable brand is stable and the other is not... which is common across many threads trying to resolve this same issue. Some USB stuff works with Silicon running Monterey and some does not. Apparently the only way to know is to just try things and see what happens. That is clearly NOT USB but more like U*SB... until Apple gets around to fixing whatever it is.All other ""2-year olds"" ""whining"" and ""sitting on their butts"" can chase every rabbit down every hole too- as this toddlerhas- but even in the ""solutions"" pursuit through thread after thread and YouTube video after video all over the web most will keep seeing seemingly smart Apple people eventually proclaiming it a bug in Monterey or Big Sur... oftenthinking whatever they triedtime(s) actually resolved it.2-year-old is about 90% confident that if Catalina could run on Mac Studio my own problem would magically resolve... and hope that Ventura will reflect an Apple macOS team finally getting around to dealing with the bug(s) that is very likely causing this problem.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vdHJhbnNwb3J0YXRpb24ud3YuZ292L0RNVi9OZXdzL1BhZ2VzL1dlc3QtVmlyZ2luaWEtRE1WLWxhdW5jaGVzLW5ldy1kaWdpdGFsLXNlcnZpY2UtUkVBTC1JRC1IZWFkc3RhcnQuYXNweNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WV Division of Motor Vehicles,"Page Content

UPDATE 12/6/2022: WASHINGTON – REAL ID ENFORCEMENT DATE IS NOW MAY 7 2025.







​CHARLESTON WV – The West Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) announced today that residents now have a new convenient option for getting their REAL ID ahead of the federal deadline on May 3 2023.

The DMV’s new digital service – REAL ID Headstart – offers an easy and guided path through pre-enrollment by allowing applicants to verify their identity upload required documents and schedule their REAL ID appointment.

REAL ID Headstart is available at dmv.wv.gov.​

REAL ID Headstart leverages industry-leading solutions from LexisNexis® Risk Solutions to quickly and securely verify identity and verify the authenticity of identity-related documentation. Identity and residency documents are reviewed by the DMV and approved prior to a scheduled appointment helping to ensure that the correct documentation is in place. The documents are presented and inspected at the appointment removing the burdensome task of scanning the materials saving West Virginians valuable time.

“I’m thrilled to announce REAL ID Headstart as the latest addition to our digital services which are making the DMV more convenient to everyday West Virginians. As always we appreciate the support of Governor Justice whose vision of making the DMV the best it can be is at the core of everything we do” said DMV Commissioner Everett Frazier. “We know that the rush is coming as the REAL ID deadline approaches. While many West Virginians already have a REAL ID this new service shows that we’re still doing everything in our power to help minimize the crowds in regional offices.”

West Virginia is one of only a few states to offer a REAL ID pre-enrollment service like REAL ID Headstart. While the federal REAL ID Act still requires the required documents be presented in-person and verified by the DMV a change to the federal law is in progress to support a completely digital upgrade. Once the act is amended the DMV aims to enhance REAL ID Headstart to support the digital process with no in-person visit required.

We have had a chance to go hands on with a number of options over the years as well as some of the most sought-after options on the market as of late and some clear front runners have emerged for folks looking to scoop one up today. While the latest PNY models sit in a nice middle ground for those looking to save some cash the SanDisk Extreme portable SSDs and Samsung’s T-series lineup still remain some of our favorite options especially considering how often they go on sale. But there are some other solutions out there that deliver some serious value for the price. Head below for a closer look at our picks for the best portable SSDs – some of which are seeing some solid price drops right now.

SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD

The SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD V2 lineup has quickly become one of the most popular options in the marketplace as well as for 9to5Toys readers and rightfully so. There are a couple of different V2 options available with the standard-issue SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD and the SanDisk Extreme Pro model but which is the best model for you?

Well in most cases as we detailed in our hands-on review the base option is likely going to be more than enough for most users as the main difference between the two comes by way of the data transfer rate speeds (1050MB/s versus up to 2000MB/s) but in many use case scenarios and with the gear most folks have in their kit a good portion of setups out there aren’t even going to be to able reach the maximum speeds on the Extreme Pro edition.

The SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD is easily one of the best options available with reliable performance modern technology and a particularly rugged build – it is obvious how well-built these drives are as soon as you pull them out of the packaging. You’re not going to get any color variations – the sort of navy blue with orange accents is the only option here – but the SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD V2 from Western Digital remains one of the most compelling and highest quality solutions on the marketplace. And with prices coming down on the latest models they have dropped from being one of the more expensive mini portable solid-state drives to delivering notable value for the price of entry. You’ll find a quick breakdown of the differences below but the major takeaway here is that only serious power users with the highest-end gear and requirements should splurge for the pro model.

SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD V2 from $105 Up to 1050MB/s USB-C USB 3.2 Gen 2 Silicon shell 2-meter drop protection 5-year warranty



SanDisk Extreme Pro Portable SSD V2 from $198 Up to 2000MB/s USB-C USB 3.2 Gen 2 Forged aluminum chassis + silicon shell 2-meter drop protection 5-year warranty



Samsung T7 Shield SSD

After the SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD there are a number of options you could take a look at from WD and others but our top pick would have to be the latest model release from Samsung. The brand’s T-series portable SSDs have sat among the top options on the marketplace for quite some time and Samsung refreshed the lineup earlier this year with the new T7 Shield portable SSD.

It might not feel as robust as the SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD to some – it certainly didn’t to me — but it is quite robust nonetheless features a unique look comes in at a slightly lower price point than the SanDisk Extreme model and is available in three unique colorways (black blue and beige). Having said all that its specs are comparatively similar to that of the base model option highlighted above with a 1050MB/s speed rating a more protective drop rating at just under three feet and a similar IP65 water and rustproof shell. Wrapped in a rubberized casing the ridged grip form-factor only seems like a novel design choice until a more smooth frame slips out of your hands one day and you lose all of your data/content to a tough smash against the concrete or on the rocks when out in the field on your next shoot.

Samsung T7 Shield from $117 Up to 1050MB/s USB-C USB 3.2 Gen 2 Rubber exterior with “Dynamic Thermal Guard” Nearly 3-meter drop protection 3-year warranty



Best bang for your buck model…

Beyond the Samsung and SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD range devices there is some serious value to be had for folks that don’t carry the big name brand affliction some of us suffer from.

Enter in the Crucial X8 lineup and the Kingston XS2000. Both options come very closer in terms of specs and feature set as the models above with even more budget-conscious pricing. The Crucial X8 lineup delivers the same 1050MB/s transfer rates as the most applicable models above with a price starting at $100. While they aren’t as protective in terms of the rubberized approach you’ll still find aluminum unibody cores and up to 7.5-feet of drop protection.

The same goes for the Kingston XS2000 portable SSD but this brings some serious value for the $70 starter price tag with ratings up to 2000MB/s with USB-C connectivity and support for USB 3.2 Gen 2×2 gear – the included rubber sleeve is a nice touch as well for the price.

An honorable mention goes to the 2022 model PNY EliteX-PRO lineup that now starts from $65.99 with new Amazon all-time low pricing available across the board. These might not be as rugged as the SanDisk Extreme Portable SSDs but they deliver even faster speeds than the base model as well as offer USB-C connectivity and they should definitely be on your radar when it comes to the best portable SSD solutions – they just aren’t quite as fast as the Kingston mentioned above.

What is the best portable SSD for your needs? When it comes down to it it’s really a matter of speed versus budget. If you don’t need the fastest possible transfer speeds you’re better off opting for a more budget-conscious model. Just keep in mind that at this point the industry standard so to speak has essentially settled at 1050MB/s and pricing for those models has come down drastically over the last year or more with the SanDisk Extreme portable SSD featured above being a good example of that. It’s also important to consider that if speed really isn’t important for your needs you can save even more by skipping out on the solid-state options for a traditional hard drive where the cost per TB is drastically less expensive. Just keep in mind that most folks consider the moving parts on HDDs to generally be less reliable than the SSD counterparts although I have had great luck with most of the brand name options I’ve used over the years especially so in situations where they essentially sit on a desktop at all times. What are the most important features of a portable SSD? The most important features on a portable SSD like with most tech gear are entirely based on your particular needs. If you require something that can keep up with rigorous work in the wild out on rugged drone and filmmaking shoots the more protective solutions from SanDisk G-DRIVE Samsung and more are a great route to take especially the SanDisk Extreme Pro model for example. For some speedy mostly at-home storage action or even when it comes to the best portable SSD for gaming you can probably save some cash and opt for something in our bang-for-your-buck category above. Just keep in mind that most folks including myself do recommend something from the big brands when it comes to the best portable SSD for photographers and video editing. Where to buy portable SSDs? Like most electronics these days Amazon is a great option and tends to have the best deals on all of the models we featured above as well as hard disk options and more. But it’s always good to double-check with retailers like Best Buy and B&H if you’re not willing to wait for the particularly notable prices we feature here on 9to5Toys on a regular basis. How to score a portable SSD deal? Well the short answer is here at 9to5Toys. We have featured the best prices ever/of the year on the SanDisk Extreme portable SSD the T7 Shield the Crucial X8 and the Kingston model as well as others. Stay locked to our Twitter and social feeds for up-to-the-minute price drops on portable SSDs NAS microSD cards and well just about everything else.

Now it says it has launched a second generation to speed it up twice as much again.

The technology takes a base NAND die with two to four access planes. Each plane is divided into four to 16 sub-planes each accessed in parallel. Page buffers are used to optimize data throughput speeds. A brochure explains that with gen 1 a total of four planes are used for SLC/TLC parallel programming. Input data is programmed into three SLC word lines in three planes and then programmed to a TLC word line in a fourth plane.

This enables a gen 1 X-NAND SSD to deliver 1600 MB/sec of sequential write throughput compared to the basic SSD’s 160MB/sec.

Neo Semiconductor brochure diagram

Gen 2 X-NAND does things differently. Two planes are used for SLC/TLC parallel programming. Input data is programmed into three SLC word lines as before but now only in one plane and then programmed to a TLC word line in a second plane. This enables data writes to occur in parallel with fewer planes and X-NAND delivers SLC-like performance from larger capacity and lower cost QLC memory.

X-NAND gen 2 says Neo Semiconductor delivers 3200MB/sec of sequential write throughput 20x faster than a basic SSD. There are also unspecified latency improvements.

It also provides 3x the base random read/write speed and there is zero increase in die size.

Neo Semiconductor X-NAND diagram

X-NAND architecture supports SLC MLC TLC QLC and PLC variants of NAND. The IP can be deployed by NAND manufacturers (Kioxia Micron Samsung SK hynix Solidigm Western Digital and YMTC) and is compatible with current technologies and processes with zero increase in manufacturing cost. At least this is the pitch by Neo Semiconductor.

The technology was awarded a “Best of Show” award for the Most Innovative Memory Technology at FMS 2022. So far we have not heard of any NAND manufacturers using Neo’s X-NAND technology. Find out more about it here.

Bootnote

Neo Semiconductor also has an X-DRAM technology based on shorter bit lines and reduced capacitance which adds parallelism. This it says increases DRAM performance with 400 percent refresh data throughput lowers the voltage needed and reduces overall power consumption."

The chamber conducted its monthly meeting Aug. 10 at the Colonial Arts Center and heard from CAC manager Anne Wilson who laid out some of the plans for the center.

“Even though we’re not fully open yet we’re about 85 percent of the way there as far as renovations and completion goes and this space is pretty much finished” Wilson said standing in the main stage area. “We’re trying to secure donors to get a big curtain that will go across the proscenium here but aside from that we have all of our sound equipment we have all of our lighting equipment and these chairs are from the Brushy Fork Event Center.”

Wilson is working with a seating company to secure permanent telescopic seating that will be portable and movable.

“We’re waiting on the installation of just a handful of housekeeping things for example our ADA chair lifts so that people can get up and down the stairs fire alarms still need to be installed and we are troubleshooting some electrical issues as well as some air conditioner problems” Wilson said. “The (City of Buckhannon) Street Department and ComforTech are trying to assess all of these issues and we are really really hoping to be fully open by January. I really want to be opened by then.”

Several areas still to be assessed include the box office and concession stand. Official plans have not been laid out for these areas and contractors have not been hired to construct these areas yet but they are planning several fundraising events this fall even without their completion.

“I’m in the works of organizing some Halloween fundraising events with a group of people” Wilson said. “David McCauley from the council is working with me and we’re trying to organize a Zombie Run which will be a 5k during the daytime; this will be more for kids and families in the community” Wilson said. “Then we’re also going to plan a zombie walk which will be a bar crawl through CJ Maggie’s Stone Tower Brews and the Whistle Stop.”

The Buckhannon Community Theatre is hoping to use the theater space in the CAC for future productions including “Clue” in the fall.

“Buckhannon Community Theatre is doing Frozen Jr. at the Wesleyan theater but in October we’re hoping they will be able to do ‘Clue’ in here so their production dates are set for October 6th to the 9th” Wilson said. “We’re hoping if everything is completed by then we can have the production in here and I’m hoping they don’t have to find another venue.”

In the spring Wilson wants to reach out to the community and gauge interest in a Chalk Art Festival where everyone would decorate the town in chalk.

“Just as far as how the building would be used aside from what I’ve already talked about any individual or organization in Buckhannon or Upshur County can apply to rent the space; I’m working on an event request form at the moment that will be available to anybody” Wilson said. “They can apply to use this art center for anything they see fit but we will have a rental review committee in place that will have me a couple of our Colonial Arts Center board members and we’ll sit down and look through rental applications to decide what’s appropriate for the space and what’s not because we do want to keep programming as related to the arts as much as possible.”

Wilson also discussed the arts center’s partnership with West Virginia Wesleyan College including volunteer and internship opportunities.

“I’ve been in communication with a lot of the folks over at Wesleyan about how to get students over here and what that’s going to look like so we’re working on creating some pop-up service scholar volunteer opportunities and I’m hoping that maybe sometime next year I could actually have a permanent or semi-permanent intern position that could be filled each school year by either an arts administration technical theater or applied art students of some sort” Wilson said. “I’m also hoping this will just be a creative outlet for Wesleyan students aside from what they have over at Wesleyan and I’m hoping that they’ll be able to utilize this as much as possible.”

The CAC is still looking for sponsors to fund the furnishings for the dressing rooms and green room located in the basement.

“We’re in the works of finding sponsors to furnish those rooms and we’re also going to need sponsors for the seating for this space and for the balcony theater but we’re still waiting on seating estimates and costs so we’re not sure how much it’s going to cost” Wilson said.

The Upshur County Board of Education has also hired recent Wesleyan graduate Jacob Spruce as the arts education facilitator to work on the educational programming that will occur in the classrooms in the basement of the facility. Wilson clarified that while she is employed by the City of Buckhannon Spruce is an Upshur County Schools employee.

“He and I will work together here in the Arts Center. We are going to have offices above the mezzanine and I will manage the building while he will facilitate educational programming in the Education Center downstairs” Wilson said. “There’s still a lot of loose ends and details that have to be figured out as far as what this is going to look like because I don’t think something like this has ever really been done before between the city and the Board of Education but I’m really excited and I’m hoping that when Jacob starts he can help me figure out some of the education side of things that I’m not really too sure about.”

Buckhannon mayor Robbie Skinner thanked St. Joseph’s Hospital for their donation to the project.

“I want to make sure we thank St. Joseph’s Hospital because St. Joe’s came forward with a significant financial contribution to sponsor the educational spaces downstairs of $250000 so St. Joe’s is a great partner in this community and we’re very much appreciative of their commitment to the educational piece of this facility” Skinner said.",,,,,,,,,
WMB,Williams Companies,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vY2FuYWRpYW5idXNpbmVzcy5jb20vcGVvcGxlL3NlcmVuYS13aWxsaWFtcy12Yy1maXJtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Serena Williams' VC Firm Is Backing This Canadian Start-Up,"Tennis star Serena Williams may be stepping off the court but she isn’t done working. She’s doubling down on helping women- and BIPOC-led businesses raise capital through her VC firm—including a Canadian fashion software start-up.

In a recent Vogue essay the 23-time Grand Slam champion revealed that she would be retiring from tennis to focus on motherhood and her VC firm Serena Ventures. Williams started her women-led firm in 2014 to primarily back diverse and early-stage tech founders: About 78 per cent of Serena Ventures’ portfolio is companies started by women and people of colour—something Williams is intentional about after learning that just two per cent of VC dollars go to women.

One of those companies is Calico. This March Serena Ventures led the $2.6-million seed round for Toronto-based start-up which was founded by Kathleen Chan in 2020. Calico helps e-commerce brands especially smaller fashion and accessories companies manage their supply chain to get their products to market as quickly as possible.

“I have experienced the exact problem Calico is solving and have rarely come across a business as in tune with the industry’s challenges and limitations as Calico” Williams who has her own fashion brand S by Serena said in a press release. “It’s a category-defining product that will have an outsized impact on retail and there couldn’t be a more critical time to help them succeed.”

Serena Ventures recently raised US$111 million of outside financing from banks private individuals and family offices and has a portfolio of 60 companies including online education platform MasterClass inclusive intimates brand Nude Barre meat substitute brand Impossible Foods and wig customization platform Parfait.

“There’s such a chronic level of undercapitalization for businesses owned and led by women by racialized people and by Indigenous people” says Christie Stephenson executive director of the Peter P. Dhillon Centre for Business Ethics at the Sauder School of Business. Even though total VC funding hit record levels in 2021 funding for women-led companies dropped to its lowest level since 2016. Funding for start-ups founded by Black entrepreneurs also fell last year. “These celebrity investors can leverage the power of both their money and their profile to make a difference in the business community and who has access to financing” Stephenson says.

Williams is hardly the only celebrity or athlete who has invested in Canadian companies as of late. This March Canadian actor Nina Dobrev and singer Shawn Mendes invested an undisclosed amount in Vancouver-based candy company SmartSweets. In March 2021 basketball stars Kyle Lowry and Kevin Durant participated in Vancouver-based blockchain start-up Dapper Labs’ $305-million financing round. Last year rapper Drake and actor Ryan Reynolds also joined a star-studded list of more than 10 venture capital firms and celebs to fund Canadian fintech Wealthsimple’s $750-million round. (Wealthsimple’s raise which pushed it to a $5-billion valuation was one of 2021’s largest financing deals.)

Beyond money celebrities lend another form of power to the companies they invest in: social capital. Wealthsimple CEO Michael Katchen had said he hoped to leverage the A-listers’ clout to promote his fintech’s brand which targets millennial investors. Some experts think that getting celebrities to invest in companies they believe in also helps build brand awareness making it easier for businesses to market a product or service to consumers.

But for celebrity investors to really have an impact Stephenson thinks more stars should use the power of both their capital and their profile to support businesses owned and led by diverse entrepreneurs—like Williams is doing. Chan the CEO of Calico told Betakit that the support from Williams and Serena Ventures is valuable given that the athlete has her own clothing collection and understands the industry.

“They not only come from an experienced background they know the nuance” Chan told the outlet. “I think that’s very very key especially in this space because you can’t be building something generic.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL25ld3Mubm9ydGhyb3BncnVtbWFuLmNvbS9uZXdzL3JlbGVhc2VzL25vcnRocm9wLWdydW1tYW4taW52ZXN0cy1pbi1uZXctc29saWQtcm9ja2V0LW1vdG9yLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmctZmFjaWxpdGllcy1pbi1tYWduYS11dGFo0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Northrop Grumman Invests in New Solid Rocket Motor Manufacturing Facilities in Magna Utah | Northrop Grumman,"MAGNA Utah – Aug. 10 2022 – Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC) is expanding its solid rocket motor manufacturing facilities with the groundbreaking of new state-of-the art facilities to support nearly every phase of solid rocket motor manufacturing including case manufacturing propellant mixing and casting and final assembly.

The term “retirement” does not appear in Serena Williams’ dictionary. “It is not a modern word” reflected the 40-year-old American tennis player winner of 23 Grand Slams who announced on Tuesday that she will hang up her racket in a few weeks. After winning everything in her sport the most successful tennis player of the Open era has decided that the time has come for her to leave sports. But she doesn’t plan to lie on the sofa to live on her savings. As she highlighted in her statement published in Vogue her goal now is to expand her family to give her four-year-old daughter Olympia a brother or sister and to focus on her business ventures where she has shown herself to be just as successful as she is on the courts.

Since sweeping the US Open at the age of 17 in 1999 the youngest of five siblings raised in the Compton neighborhood of Los Angeles has become an icon of her sport. She is now one of the most influential people in the United States. Her unparalleled successes in tennis have made Williams the highest-earning female athlete in history. For most of her career she was the highest paid in the world. According to Forbes Serena Williams has a fortune of $260 million (almost €255 million) making her the richest female athlete of all time. Of that amount $94.5 million came from her earnings on the WTA circuit. She is the tennis player who has earned the most money in history just ahead of her sister Venus who earned almost half the amount ($42.3 million).

Serena Williams is one of the greatest athletics figures of all time the second tennis player with the most Grand Slams in history only behind Margaret Court who won 24 before the Open era. Williams has used her tennis stardom to build a business empire to which she will dedicate herself entirely once she retires from the WTA circuit after the US Open that begins on August 29.

Many athletes especially big stars have unrelated businesses that often bring them greater benefits than success in competitions. Sponsorships continue to be a very important part of the income of athletes but they are increasingly looking for ways to diversify. Soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo owns a hotel chain and a hair transplant company. Golf star Tiger Woods founded an audiovisual production company for sports content. Racing driver Lewis Hamilton promotes a project to manufacture electric racing cars. Like these champions Williams has plunged headlong into the business world. She currently has developed initiatives in three areas: fashion audiovisual production and entrepreneurship investment.

Williams’ passion for tennis is matched only by her interest in fashion. After several collaborations with Nike the tennis player launched her own line of women’s clothing in 2018 under the name S by Serena. On its online sales page the prices of its designs range from €30 to €250. The following year it expanded its offer and launched a line of jewelry under the same name. “Some criticized my decision but I knew I had two passions tennis and fashion and I had to find a way to make them coexist” Williams explained then.

The celebrity’s life has also been brought to the big screen. In 2018 she presented the biographical documentary Being Serena which won a PGA Award. Last year she made the leap to Hollywood. Along with her sister Venus she produced the film King Richard starring Will Smith as the father of the two tennis players. “The way Will plays my father just takes the movie to another level” Serena said at the film’s premiere. The Academy agreed awarding Smith the statuette for Best Actor during an evening that ended in controversy due to the actor’s aggression against presenter Chris Rock.

The 23-time Grand Slam winner has another ambitious project in her hands: Serena Ventures her investment fund for entrepreneurs founded in 2014. Her husband Alexis Ohanian the creator of Reddit convinced her that creating her own investment fund would allow her to support the projects in which she was more involved and boost the careers of women and African Americans in the United States. “I want to be in the infrastructure. I want to be the brand instead of just being the face” she said in an interview with Forbes. In March of this year she raised $110 million in seed funding for Serena Ventures which currently funds more than 60 companies most of them run by women or Black people.

Serena Williams will put down the racket in the coming weeks to take up a businesswoman’s suit–surely of her own design. But the greatest tennis player of the 21st century will not simply disappear. As she herself says she is about to evolve.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vYWZyb3RlY2guY29tL3NlcmVuYS12ZW50dXJlcy1pbnZlc3RtZW50LTVtLXdvbmRlcm1pbmTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Serena Williams Invests $5M Into Selena Gomez's Wondermind As The Multimedia Company Reportedly Hits $100M ...,"Williams is currently in the process of saying goodbye to the world of tennis as previously reported by VOGUE. Yet she is proving there is far more work to be done beyond the court. Toward the latter end of her career her focus shifted more and more toward Serena Ventures. The company’s investments have scaled companies in various industries including fitness hair education mental wellness and food among others.

“In my own life the balance has been slowly shifting toward Serena Ventures” Williams told VOGUE. “I always say that I’m a sponge: At night I go to bed and I squeeze myself out so that the next day I can take up as much new information as I can. Every morning I’m so excited to walk downstairs to my office and jump onto Zooms and start reviewing decks of companies we’re considering investing in. We’re a small but growing firm of six people scattered between Florida where I mainly live Texas and California.”

She continued: “I started investing nine years ago and I really fell in love with early stage whether it’s pre-seed funding where you’re investing in just an idea or seed where the idea has already been turned into a product. I wrote one of the very first checks for MasterClass. It’s one of 16 unicorns—companies valued at more than $1 billion—that Serena Ventures has funded along with Tonal Impossible Foods Noom and Esusu to name a few. This year we raised $111 million of outside financing from banks private individuals and family offices.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vY29zbWV0aWNzYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3NlcmVuYS1zLXRlbm5pcy1yZXRpcmVtZW50LXdoYXQtZG9lcy1pdC1tZWFuLWZvci1iZWF1dHktc3RhcnQtdXBzLS0yMDI4MDXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Serena's tennis retirement: What does it mean for beauty start-ups?,"Serena Williams has announced her retirement from tennis.

This is particularly true as it relates to the HR programs and employee benefits practices that attract and retain talent. What do we do now? What’s everyone else doing? What are our employees looking for?

Since 2020 business survival has translated to quick pivots that have responded to a relentless barrage of unexpected crises – and no time to ensure critical HR policies and practices keep pace. But going forward sustained survival will require a return to a thoughtful strategy for maintaining the foundation of your organization’s employee value proposition.

Understanding both the current work environment and the competitive forces at play has a significant impact on cost implications resourcing needs and legal requirements. Today’s business challenges are less about reacting to the pandemic and more about expense containment and long-term growth.

The changing role of the employee experience

In the past few years organizations have needed – but didn’t have time for – benchmarks and standard guidelines. Policies and programs that historically we had thought of as “standard” suddenly became less standard.

Traditionally organizations have gotten by with only slight tweaks to policies and practices as the business changed but those days are gone. In a very different employment world the demands of the workforce and organizations’ desire to develop and deliver an employee experience that attracts and retains talent is paramount.

Employers must go beyond a simple understanding of wellbeing or short-term accommodations. Rather policies must be set to address talent needs now as well as accommodate the way the business will operate going forward. An entire host of challenges must be addressed:

Retention packages

Leave policies

Working hours

Remote work arrangements

Perks (e.g. car allowances)

The downfall of blanket global policies

Standard out-of-the-box policies have become a rarity and minor tweaks and updates are no longer enough. It’s easy to see then that blanket HR policies and benefits practices won’t work across geographies even if it’s to address common problems.

Take for example a few practices that have emerged in China the United Kingdom and United States all based on data from WTW’s HR Policies and Practices and Benefits Design Practices surveys.

Retention

Sales and marketing jobs in China are seeing greater levels of attrition than most other countries while the United States is seeing greater challenges in operations and manufacturing. Interestingly retention bonus arrangements for executives are much higher in the United States and United Kingdom than elsewhere – but retention bonuses for technical and business support are much higher in China. Meanwhile recruiting needs are greater for nearly all roles in the United States.

Leave policies

UK organizations provide the most paid leave by years of service reaching a maximum of just under 30 days after about 10 years. The United States which falls between China and the UK shows a steady increase in the number of days of paid leave over time. Finally China has the lowest amount of paid leave among the three countries topping out at just under 20 days.

Working hours

For more than 90% of office workers a 40-hour workweek is standard in China and the United States. However workers in United Kingdom have a shorter 37.5-hour workweek. When it comes to plant workers China has the longest working hours with data indicating that some employees work up to 60 hours per week.

Figure 3. Working hours compared

Remote work arrangements

Computers and laptops are the most common work-from-home costs covered by organizations in all three countries studied. In addition mobile or fixed phone lines and internet connections are paid by more than half of the organizations in the United Kingdom (61%) but are less likely to be covered in established work-from-home policies in the United States (31.5%) and China (26.8%).

Perks

Length of service awards followed by mobile phone allowances are the perquisites most often provided by organizations in China and the United Kingdom. Conversely daycare or childcare allowances are the least offered perquisites in most of the organizations in these two countries.

The rise of policies that make sense

Navigating geographical pain points designing HR programs that award enough (but not too much) and knowing where your competitors are focusing their investments is critical. The best way to achieve this balance cost effectively efficiently and with the most return on investment is accomplished by weighing reliable market data. Without that data employers will be challenged to make good defensible decisions. And without those good defensible decisions the employee experience – and by extension employee engagement and business outcomes – will suffer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlaW5zdXJhbmNlbmUud3Mvd3R3LWV4cGFuZHMtZW5lcmd5LXRlYW0taW4taG91c3Rvbi13aXRoLXNlbmlvci1oaXJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WTW expands energy team in Houston with senior hire,"Broker WTW has announced that it has appointed Blake Koen to join the company’s rapidly expanding energy team in Houston as managing director global client advocate natural resources for its North America business.

The global pandemic accelerated the digital transformation of work and the work experience. Stranded at home millions of workers across the globe replaced daily commutes office desks and watercooler chats with Zoom calls. Cue the next evolution in the virtualization of work the metaverse; essentially an application of spatial computing that will see us using our avatars to work meet learn socialize play trade and transact in fully immersive virtual environments. Media hype notwithstanding the metaverse is already here.

At the same time another technological revolution is brewing the so-called decentralized web or “Web3”. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and cryptocurrencies are perhaps the best-known applications of this new iteration of the web while decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) running on public blockchains are already ushering in a revolutionary way to reimagine how human communities businesses and labor get organized.

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations in Web3

DAOs exploit smart contract architectures and digital tokens verified on public blockchains such as Ethereum in order to give members of a DAO the possibility to directly participate in its governance. Decision making thus becomes collective and based on how many votes — expressed in the number of tokens — a certain proposal in the DAO gets. There are no barriers to entry and owning tokens in a decentralized autonomous organization is permissionless. Since all rules are coded in smart contracts and all transactions are recorded on a blockchain a DAO is fully transparent to its members. If the DAO is purposed with developing ideas or software then the IP is open-sourced at least for now.

The combination of the metaverse and a decentralized Web3 has the potential to radically transform operating models and the labor market. As Zarkadakis explains in Cyber Republic as decentralized autonomous organizations are adopted more widely new types of businesses will emerge that would look more like cooperatives and less than corporations significantly reducing agency costs. In such decentralized organizations leadership will rely on soft power and empathy using culture and shared values to align the interests of disparate stakeholders to a common mission and purpose.

In a DAO there are no officers or directors or managers and therefore leadership roles are more fluid and impermanent giving more opportunities to members to rise up. DAOs may decide to prioritize social goods — such as job security — above operational efficiency. This shift from hierarchical structures to flat widely distributed networks and ecosystems run by stakeholder communities instead of boards and executives will have a profound impact on work too.

The visual below illustrates the fundamental differences between traditional organizations and decentralized autonomous organizations.

Work Without Jobs

One of the most significant implications of metaverse for the future of work relates to how work will be organized and talent connected to work. In Work Without Jobs Jesuthasan and Boudreau describe three ways in which talent is connected to work (fixed flex and flow) within the context of a new work operating model for companies organized within the context of a corporate structure. With the introduction of decentralized autonomous organizations we see a fourth option with even less friction and much greater agility one where work flows to talent. The following visual illustrates these four options and the potential gains as we move from left to right.

Within the context of work being increasingly organized as decentralized autonomous organizations the traditional hierarchical mix of roles within a corporate structure (leader manager employee contractor and vendor) and functions will morph significantly into a flatter construct comprising:

A core group of individuals responsible for coordination of work and delivering on the value proposition of the DAO.

A broader contributor group that provides specific services to execute the mission of the DAO. This includes other DAOs that provide services like HR finance and accounting and customer service on an ongoing basis and individual contributors (gig workers or contractors) that take on projects as needed.

An even broader group of “members” who will promote brands support continued crowdsourcing of ongoing product innovation or otherwise contribute to the advancement of the DAO’s mission.

Each of these groups will be compensated quite differently. The core group will share in the total value created by the decentralized autonomous organization less payments to the other two groups. The payments to the contributor group will vary between fixed payments for ongoing services in the case of a DAO providing HR services and more episodic payments to individual contributors as they take on and execute specific projects. Members will be rewarded as they make various contributions to the DAO with the potential for payment in NFTs with virtual-to-physical redemptions.

How Can Businesses Adapt to Web3?

There are still many challenges for the adoption of a decentralized web and the metaverse. In most places around the world DAOs do not currently have a legal status which poses serious issues especially when a decentralized autonomous organization extends its activities beyond the digital space. Regulators are still struggling to keep up with the high rate of innovation that comes from Web3 pioneers. Nevertheless there are already clear opportunities for businesses to start thinking and piloting use cases for a decentralized metaverse future. Here are a few ways to prototype your initial steps into this new world of work:

Related Reading What Is the Future of NFTs? Understanding the Metaverse and Its Potential Risks Purchasing the Metaverse — How Does It Work?

Broaden the participation in your business model. DAOs present us with an opportunity to increase the agility of the enterprise by enabling work to flow to talent beyond the traditional “walls” of the organization. Consider creating a DAO that enables the broader community of stakeholders in your business to participate in promoting your brands or crowdsourcing ideas for innovation.

Experiment with taking the idea of a decentralized autonomous organization further by outsourcing ESG goals to a DAO governed by your company’s stakeholders such as employees contractors suppliers and impacted communities.

August 11 2022 Jon Sofen Senior Editor U.S.

The World Poker Tour (WPT) and Wynn Resorts in Las Vegas have finalized the schedule for its December record-breaking poker festival.

In total the series which runs December 1-20 features 23 tournaments and $22 million in guarantees. Although there are a number of major events including the WPT Ladies Championship and what figures to be another exciting Mystery Bounty event at Wynn the series is highlighted by the largest guaranteed prize pool poker tournament in history.

World Poker Tour to Break Records at Wynn

The $10400 buy-in WPT World Championship the first WPT Main Tour event at Wynn promises a $15 million minimum prize pool. Action in the historic event at the luxurious Las Vegas Strip casino resort begins December 12 and concludes with the final table on December 20.

“Our goal is to develop the WPT World Championship into one of the most talked about events of the year” Adam Pliska CEO of the World Poker Tour said.

There's no doubt the record-breaking event will be one of the main topics of discussion as the tournament approaches. Many of the top pros in the game have already made it known publicly they plan to compete. The tournament should have a solid mix of pros and recreational players much like the World Series of Poker Main Event also a $10000 buy-in tournament in Las Vegas.

Not a One-Trick Pony

Wynn Mystery Bounty Events are alway a lot of fun!

The late-year festival at Wynn has more to it than just one big event. Play kicks off December 1 with a $600 buy-in no-limit hold'em tournament featuring a $500000 guaranteed prize pool. There will be two Day 1 starting flights each day through the 3rd.

For those who enjoy the non-hold'em games the casino will be spreading an $1100 HORSE event on December 12 and then an Omaha/8 tournament the following day. Both cost $1100 to enter and will have at least $100000 in the pot. On December 8 there will be a $3000 buy-in 8-Game Mix with $200000 guaranteed.

The biggest events of the festival beyond the WPT World Championship are the $1100 Ladies Championship ($200000 guaranteed December 16-18) $1100 WPT Prime Championship ($2 million guaranteed December 8-13) and the $1600 Mystery Bounty ($2 million guaranteed December 16-19) in which players can draw bounty cash prizes up to $100000. Wynn's poker room has been the catalyst behind the new popular mystery bounty gimmick that has taken over tournament poker the past couple of years.

The final event of the series on December 19 is the $600 Tag Team Bomb Pot a one-day tournament that runs one day before the WPT World Championship final table.

As Wynn Las Vegas nears the announcement of its new show and the unveiling of its new theater a nearby cafe is getting a rebrand that seems to fit the theatrical theme.

The Cafe temporarily closed will reopen as Caffe Al Teatro in late 2022.

Caffe Al Teatro in Italian of course translates as “cafe at the theater.”

In Spanish it translates as “cafe to the theater” which is awkward so we’re pretty sure the name isn’t Spanish.

Theoretically “Al Teatro” could be someone’s name in which case Caffe Al Teatro would refer to “Al’s cafe.” Look this story is light on details so we’re just trying to make more words to the photos don’t slap together. Or as we call it Wednesday.

Technically the “theater” in Caffe al Teatro means “theaters” as this popular cafe is located near both the Wynn Theater and Encore Theater.

The Cafe was previously the Drugstore Cafe also referred to as the Cafe at the Drugstore due to its proximity to the hotel’s sundries shop.

This 24-hour cafe serves up coffee and light meals and we expect it will continue to do so.

During the cafe’s transition guests are encouraged to get their caffeine and “morning favorites” at Allegro Cafe Express or The Cafe Express Cart.

The Wynn Theater has been closed since the beginning of the pandemic. “Le Reve” closed with it and never reopened. The pandemic was a time of many sad trombones.

There’s a new show in the works at Wynn the name of which has eluded us despite our persistent poking around. Word from those with friends in the show say it’s a mixture of magic and dance. One source says it’s along the lines of “Absinthe” without the raunchy humor. Wynn Resort says that’s not the case.

An announcement about the show should happen within the next few months although the show won’t open until after Oct. 31 2022 per the resort.

It seems Caffe Al Teatro will debut around the same time.

Stay tuned for more about all the goings on at Wynn Las Vegas.

Which reminds us: Do the kids even know what “stay tuned” means? If you’re streaming there’s no real staying tuned. And while we’re on the subject has the phrase “goings on” been used more recently than 1990?

The only phrase more antiquated is “cool hang” but nobody says that anymore thankfully. Does “cool” even mean “cool” anymore? Can hangs be “snatched”?

Answers to these and other burning questions in future blog posts. Are there even blogs now or is everything just shared on TikTok?

Does anyone say “burning questions” anymore? And isn’t that a burning question in and of itself?

And who says “in and of itself”? And did you know “in and of itself” comes from the Latin “per se” meaning “by itself”?

And who even remembers Latin? We do! If it weren’t for Latin we wouldn’t be able to share “theater” comes from the Latin “theatrum” and before that from the ancient Greek “theatron” meaning “a place for viewing.”

Sometimes “theater” is spelled “theatre.” It’s a little extra like stuffing a superfluous “f” in “caffe.” If someone uses “theatre” in the U.S. they’re snooty and should be avoided at all costs.

It’s worth noting nobody has used the word “snooty” in several decades.

If you disagree with our opinion about the use of “theater” vs. “theatre” feel free to share your misguided views as a conversation-starter when you visit Caffe Al Teatro at Wynn Las Vegas in late 2022.

We knew we were going somewhere with all that. Thanks for taking the ride with us.

Update (9/10/22): Wynn Resorts shared some thoughts: “The Cafe at Wynn Las Vegas is currently closed for renovations with plans to reopen later this year as the newly-imagined Caffe al Teatro a European-inspired cafe featuring artisanal pastries sandwiches salads and grab-and-go items. During the extended closure a 24-hour Cafe Express Cart will serve specialty coffees pastries salads sandwiches and select beverages from a temporary location on the casino floor near Allegro. Additionally several temporary quick-service stations will be located throughout Wynn and Encore where guests can purchase coffee snacks and more.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvZHNhdmV0aGVwb2ludHMuY29tL3d5bm4td2luZS1kaW5uZXItc2VyaWVzLWxhcy12ZWdhcy0xMGsv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Want An Exclusive Bite To Eat And Drink At Wynn?,"It seems appropriate that former poker player H. William (Bill) Harlan would be hosting a Wynn wine dinner series event in Las Vegas. And if you too have a spare ten grand sitting around you can be part of this extravaganza combining a meal from a Wynn chef with wines chosen from Domain H. William Harlan.

Naturally you’ll dine at one of Wynn’s most extravagant locations whether that’s the 18th hole of the golf club a two-story Encore Duplex suite or a location which is so special that it hasn’t been announced yet.

“The series offers attendees an opportunity to sample a variety of the most elusive labels from Harlan’s time-honored wineries – including Harlan Estate BOND and Promontory – paired with specially curated menus from Wynn’s acclaimed chefs.” –Wynn Press Release

Wynn Wine Dinner Series

Each dinner will take place this fall and be limited to 20 guests. You will also become an immediate member of your chosen winery’s wine club “bypassing the lengthy waitlist.” Wynn will also kick in one night in a Wynn Tower Suite so you’ll have a place to collapse after the indulgence.

You have three options to choose from.

Enjoy Dinner at an Encore Duplex on September 10

Your first option begins with a Krug Champagne reception followed by dinner from SW Steakhouse executive chef Mark LoRosso and accompanied by wine pairings chosen by second-generation proprietor Amanda Harlan.

You’ll have a six-course meal headlined by a choice of Turbot Filet Boneless Quail and Japanese Kobe Beef. No word on where they find quail without bones. Each course will of course have wine with it.

Bond on October 15 at the 18th Hole

If that doesn’t meet your tastes feel free to drop by in mid-October for the Krug Champagne reception after which you’ll eat on the 18th hole of Wynn Golf Club. Cooking for your tonight will be Chef Joshua Smith of Wynn’s Delilah with of course the requisite wine pairings.

No word on whether a round of golf is included.

Mizumi Dinner in November

And if you’re not ready to make a location commitment yet sign up for the November 12 dinner which will be hosted by Mizumi Executive Chef Min Kim with wine pairings chosen by William Harlan.

The wine will be a Promontory blend a region that Wynn describes as “a world apart from the Napa Valley that most people experience. Within this secluded territory—near the heart of the valley but completely hidden—two distinct fault lines mark the divides among volcanic sedimentary and metamorphic formations.”

Only In Las Vegas

This dinner-wine series could only take place in Las Vegas a city known as a mecca for decadence and excess. While 60 people are enjoying their $10000 meals there will no doubt be a player in the high-roller baccarat room betting that much on the turn of a card.

The company says area communities also benefit from the property tax revenue generated by Xcel Energy’s network of electrical facilities across the region.

Also in 2021 Xcel Energy paid $62 million in property taxes to local governments in the Panhandle and South Plains region of Texas and in eastern and southeastern New Mexico.

Additionally Xcel Energy paid $22.3 million in franchise fees to municipal and county governments.

“It’s important to us personally and as employees of the region’s leading energy company that the communities we serve thrive economically” Rodriguez said. “Our team’s roots run deep here and we’ll be here for many years to come.”

The commission determined that the utilities could have done more to protect customers from sky-high prices and should bear some of the cost — albeit about a tenth of the nearly $662 million in so-called extraordinary costs the utilities incurred during just five days in February 2021.

Under the commission’s decision utility companies Xcel CenterPoint and Great Plains won’t be able to pass along $55.5 million of the costs from Winter Storm Uri. The utilities must also submit proposals to the commission on how to help protect customers from price spikes in the future.

A fourth utility Minnesota Energy Resources Company agreed in a settlement to bear $3 million of the $65 million in extra costs it incurred.

“Our job is to act in the best interest of the consumer and that is why we ordered a thorough investigation” said Katie Sieben PUC chair in a statement. “Utilities could’ve done better to protect customers from the risks of these price increases. And going forward they need to be more diligent as these extreme weather events are becoming more frequent.”

The decision comes after state officials at the Department of Commerce and Attorney General’s Office along with the non-profit advocacy group Citizens Utility Board challenged the utilities’ ability to charge consumers the full amount.

They argued each of the utilities could have done more to offset costs by tapping into their emergency reserves limiting their gas purchases and having certain customers curtail their use.

Customers will save less than the state agencies and energy advocates wanted. The Department of Commerce estimated that the utilities spent $178.6 million more than necessary during the five-day storm through various missteps and argued customers should not have to shoulder that portion.

“Even though their final decisions were lower than what we recommended we’re actually really happy with the result” said Brian Edstrom senior regulatory advocate at the Citizens Utility Board. “We think the commission took a really strong stand.”

A spokesperson for CenterPoint shared a statement saying the company appreciated the time the commission spent reviewing the costs and thanking the commission for acknowledging CenterPoint provided reliable service. The spokesperson said no decision had been made on appealing the decision.

A spokesperson for Xcel said the company was proud of the work its employees did to maintain service during the storm and is “evaluating the commission’s decision” before deciding “next steps.”

Minnesotans didn’t experience any gas shortages during Winter Storm Uri and were able to continue heating their homes as temperatures plunged to record lows across the state reaching -19 in the Twin Cities and -50 near Ely. In Texas meanwhile hundreds of people are estimated to have died during the storm.

“They did provide reliable service to Minnesotans … and the utilities should be commended for that” Edstrom said. “But customers don’t write a blank check for reliable service. Utilities have to balance their responsibility to provide reliable service with their responsibility to protect customers from price spikes.”

Minnesotans who use natural gas will be paying off the costs from the five-day storm for years under payment plans negotiated with the PUC.

Although the decision from the PUC will force utilities to share in some of the pain the storm may turn out to be a boon for gas utilities.

CenterPoint for example received $1.3 billion in net after-tax proceeds as the result of a merger with a company accused of price-gouging customers during Winter Storm Uri.

CenterPoint acquired shares of the company before the winter storm after which the stock value shot up 20%.

CenterPoint incurred nearly $409 million in extraordinary costs from the storm but will not be allowed to pass on $35.7 million to customers under the PUC decision.

Xcel Energy incurred $179 million in costs but will not be allowed to pass on $19 million to customers under the PUC decision.

Great Plains incurred $8.8 million in extraordinary costs but will not be allowed to pass on $885000 to customers under the PUC decision.

Great Plains did not respond to a request for comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9taW5uZXNvdGEtY29uc3VtZXJzLXdpbGwtcGF5LTYwMG0taW4tZXh0cmEtY29zdHMtZnJvbS1mZWJydWFyeS0yMDIxLXN0b3JtLzYwMDE5NzU5Ni_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Minnesota consumers will pay $600M in extra costs from February 2021 storm,"Minnesota utility regulators Thursday faulted the state's gas providers for their response to a February 2021 storm prohibiting them from passing down nearly $60 million in costs to consumers.

The decision still means about $600 million of wholesale gas costs can be passed onto consumers who already have started to pay those amounts through a special surcharge.

The decision by the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to reject about 9% of the costs fell far short of a recommendation by the Minnesota Department of Commerce which represents ratepayers and utility watchdog groups.

Still the PUC's decision was considerably more beneficial to consumers than a ruling earlier this year by two administrative law judges. They found the utilities entirely justified in collecting the full $660 million bill from ratepayers.

""We wish the commission would have gone further — that obviously would have been better for consumers — but at the at the end of the day I am really pleased with how the PUC acted"" said Brian Edstrom senior regulatory advocate for the Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota a ratepayer advocacy group.

Wholesale gas prices in Minnesota and many other states soared in February 2021 when a historic storm hit Texas and other natural gas-producing states. Temperatures plunged gas field equipment froze up and supply cratered just as demand climbed.

Many Minnesotans will pony up 50% more than they pay annually for their heating bills just to cover the storm's gas costs.

Minnesota like many states allows utilities to directly pass wholesale gas price swings to ratepayers. But watchdogs have wondered if because of that rule utilities did not take more evasive actions to manage storm-related costs.

""If utilities' own resources were at risk I think they would have made different decisions"" PUC Commissioner Joe Sullivan said at Thursday's meeting.

Last year the PUC allowed four investor-owned utilities to begin recovering the costs but also opened up an investigation that culminated in Thursday's ruling.

The commission rejected $35.7 million of the $409 million CenterPoint Energy incurred during the storm; $19 million of Xcel Energy's $179 million tab; and $845000 of $8.8 million in costs for Great Plains Natural Gas Co. a small utility in western Minnesota.

MERC an arm of Milwaukee-based WEC Energy Group signed an 11th hour settlement agreement Wednesday that would disallow $3 million of its $65 million in extraordinary gas costs from the storm.

The Commerce Department the Minnesota Attorney General's Office and the Citizens Utility Board signed the settlement. MERC did not admit to any ""imprudence or unreasonable action"" in connection with the February 2021 storm.

The utilities' prudency during the storm was at the heart of the PUC's investigation.

The gas companies said they were acting prudently — given the information they had at the time of the storm — and followed good utility practices.

The AG's office the Commerce Department and the Citizens Utility Board contend the utilities did not act prudently from Feb. 13 to Feb. 17 — and that their mismanagement caused them to rely too much on an overheated spot gas market.

They said the utilities didn't withdraw enough gas from storage depots miscalculated gas supply forecasts and in some cases did not curtail gas to business customers when they should have.

Also CenterPoint and Xcel failed to adequately use backup gas reserves known as peaking plants they said.

For all those reasons the Department of Commerce had recommended that the PUC reject up to $122 million of Xcel's storm-related gas costs; $45 million for CenterPoint; $10.7 million for MERC; and $845000 for Great Plains.

The PUC fully followed Commerce's recommendations only for Great Plains. The PUC disallowed $37.7 million of CenterPoint's costs and about $19 million of Xcel's. All disallowance votes were 4-1 with Commissioner Valerie Means voting against.

Means agreed with the administrative law judges' report to allow the utilities to recover the full $660 million.

""In my opinion the ALJs' report is comprehensive through and through"" Means said. The record ""is replete with evidence to support their recommendations.""

The PUC rejected about $12 million of CenterPoint's costs for not maximizing the amount of gas it had in storage depots. It disallowed another $12.4 million saying that CenterPoint should have used its peaking plant more during the gas crisis.

Peaking plants provide gas reserves during emergencies though CenterPoint and Xcel contend that means only when gas supplies are short not expensive. The PUC disagreed also rejecting $14.7 million in Xcel's costs for failing to use its peaking plant.

Xcel's largest peaking plant in Inver Grove Heights was idled six weeks before the storm after it malfunctioned and twice leaked gas. A cautious Xcel then closed two smaller peaking plants.

Xcel's ""peaking plants should have been available and had they been available they should have been used"" said PUC Commissioner Matt Schuerger.

The U.S. Department of Commerce announced Tuesday Aug. 9 that Hayden and neighboring Craig — another community in the shadow of a soon-to-close coal-fired power plant — would receive a total of $8.5 million that was directed toward coal communities in the American Rescue Plan.

The award to Hayden is enough to bring the planned industrial park near the Yampa Valley Regional Airport to full funding said town manager Mathew Mendisco.

“This business park we believe is going to be almost like the change agent for the valley” Mendisco said. “It’s going to give the opportunity for a lot of local businesses to expand where they may not have been able to.”

The industrial park project started as one facet of a proposal to get grant money through the Build Back Better Regional Challenge in a similar vein as a project in Sheridan Wyoming that helped diversify its economy which was similarly based on extraction and tourism industries.

The regional proposal ultimately wasn’t chosen but Mendisco kept the project alive and shifted to pursue funding from the U.S. Economic Development Administration.

“We’ve been working really hard for this” Mendisco said. “It’s going to centrally locate a lot of businesses which will be a benefit for the entire valley.”

The grant will fund infrastructure like roads water and sewer on the property officially annexed into the town last week. The idea is that the parcels could be ready-made for a business to buy or lease and then build what their business would need.

The goal of the industrial park is to offer local companies looking to grow their operation an option to stay in the Yampa Valley. While attracting a new company isn’t a bad thing Mendisco said the project is really centered around retaining and expanding businesses that are already here.

“As we are transitioning away from coal in the valley it’s a step in the right direction for the community of Hayden to expand economically” said Mayor Zach Wuestewald. “As we lose a huge economic driver in the future we all got to find ways to weather the storm economically.”

Wuestewald emphasized that there is still a lot of work to do before Hayden has a certain future as it prepares for the closing of the Hayden Station — the Xcel Energy owned power plant that is slated to close by the end of 2028.

Entities like the school fire and library district in Hayden currently get between 55% and 65% of their funding from property taxes paid by the power plant.

“It’s going to be a big deal when we lose the tax revenue that we’re going to lose” Wuestewald said. “There is no answer but having somewhat of a blueprint is reassuring.”

The money comes from the EDA’s American Rescue Plan Economic Adjustment Assistance program which offered $500 million in these grants to communities across the country.

Mendisco referred to it as a “once in a lifetime opportunity” because this particular program allows for a less significant match in funding locally. Had Hayden needed to match half the $5.2 million grant Mendisco said the project likely wouldn’t have been possible for the town of 2000 residents.

The federal government’s $5.2 million is being matched by more than $700000 in local and state funding and is estimated to produce almost 80 jobs and about $12 million in private investment.

“When I’ve visited communities in Northwest Colorado over the years I’ve heard concerns about what coal mine and power plant closures will mean for their main streets schools and way of life” said U.S Sen. Michael Bennet a Democrat in a statement about the funding.

“These federal grants will help coal communities like Craig and Hayden attract new businesses create new jobs and diversify their local economies so they can thrive” he continued.

Mendisco said the next step in the project is to officially purchase the land in question using money the town already had from the Colorado Office of Just Transition. That office was formed to help communities losing significant parts of their economy as Colorado set some of the most aggressive emission reduction goals in the country.

The plan is to have design work completed by the end of December so the project could be put out for bid sometime in January he said.

“This project was meant for business retention and expansion locally” Mendisco said. “To create more jobs here sustainably and we can invest in the future and the businesses that are already here.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vdmlsbGFnZXJwdWJsaXNoaW5nLmNvbS9uZXctd2VzdGVybi1nb3Zlcm5vcnMtY2hhaXItamFyZWQtcG9saXMtYWR2YW5jZXMtZ2VvdGhlcm1hbC1lbmVyZ3ktaW5pdGlhdGl2ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Western Governors Chair Jared Polis advances geothermal energy initiative,"BY FREDA MIKLIN

GOVERNMENTAL REPORTER

On June 30 Colorado Gov. Jared Polis was elected as the new chair of the Western Governors Association (WGA) a group consisting of the governors of the 19 westernmost states in the U.S. For those who keep score 11 of the current governors who comprise the WGA are Republicans and eight are Democrats.

On July 26 at WGA’s annual meeting Gov. Polis announced “Heat Beneath Our Feet” as his 2023 WGA Chair initiative. Said Polis “As the incoming Chair of the bipartisan Western Governors Association I am excited to establish Heat Beneath Our Feet as my initiative because geothermal energy is an opportunity to save people money boost local economies and help us achieve 100% renewable energy in Colorado by 2040. I look forward to making progress towards clean lower-cost power through the Heat Beneath Our Feet initiative and the strong bipartisan partnership of the WGA that will lead geothermal energy innovation.”

From the annual meeting of the WGA from left to right ND Gov. Doug Burgum U.S. Sec. of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra Utah Gov. Spencer Cox CO Gov. Jared Polis WGA Executive Director James Oxsbury WY Gov. Mark Gordon ID Gov. Brad Little HI Gov. David Ige MT Gov. Greg Gianforte AZ Gov. Doug Ducey and U.S. Sec. of Agriculture Tom Vilsack.

On the State of Colorado website it says that in addition to helping achieve our state’s goals in the area of renewable energy “Geothermal energy provides new resources that will advance (Polis’) goal of… ensuring other states have that opportunity to develop renewable energy technology.” It explains “Geothermal energy is a renewable resource that can generate electricity or provide heating and cooling for buildings and water. The U.S. possesses approximately 25% of the world’s installed geothermal energy capacity and 95% of that is in the Western States. Bringing the WGA bipartisan leadership focus to exploration provides an opportunity for collaborative development.”

Also contained on the State of Colorado’s website are statements of support for the initiative from leaders of major utilities. “Xcel Energy Colorado is excited about the Heat Beneath Our Feet initiative as geothermal electric generation and ground-source heating are both important advanced technology solutions to further decarbonize our system toward a net zero future. Geothermal technology solutions can provide the important emissions-free electricity we need when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining while supporting our customers’ heating needs and a robust energy grid. The coordinated technology advancement contemplated by the Heat Beneath Our Feet Initiative working with our electric plans and Clean Heat Plans is exactly what we need in the West to foster innovation and new technology” said Robert Kenney President Xcel Energy-Colorado.

This map shows the member states of the Western Governors’ Association plus Alaska and Hawaii.

Duane Highley CEO of Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association said “Tri-State applauds our Western Governors’ leadership in launching The Heat Beneath Our Feet initiative. Exploring and validating the West’s abundant geothermal resources advances the potential for much needed emissions-free dispatchable power at a time when conventional base load resources are retiring from service.”

Others who shared statements supporting Polis’ Heat Beneath Our Feet initiative include Dr. Amanda Kolker Laboratory Program Manager for Geothermal at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory Gary Arnold Business Manager Denver Pipefitters Local #208 and Morgan D. Bazilian Ph.D. Director Payne Institute Colorado School of Mines.

The Villager reached out to Jack Spina WGA Communications Director who told us “People are really excited about Heat Beneath Our Feet including representatives of multiple federal agencies. This is another tool to bring down energy costs in a sustainable way.

Published 08-11-22 Submitted by Yum! Brands

PLANO Texas August 11 2022 /CSRwire/ - Pizza Hut known for cheese-centric innovations and its parent company Yum! Brands are partnering with Dairy Farmers of America (DFA) a farmer-owned cooperative with more than 11500 farm families and dairy suppliers to provide participating farmers with the technology and data needed to help reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

Pizza Hut has begun working alongside DFA and dairy suppliers to enroll interested dairy farm families within their supply chain in the joint dairy project where they’ll participate in annual farm-level greenhouse gas and energy foot-printing through the Farmers Assuring Responsible Management and Environmental Stewardship (FARM ES) evaluation over a three-year period. By 2025 the end of the three-year period Pizza Hut aims to source 50% of the dairy used to make its pizza cheese from dairy farms enrolled in the FARM ES program.

Once enrolled farms will receive a SCiO cup the world’s fastest lab-grade dry matter analyzer allowing farmers to access instant dry matter analysis of their cows’ feed helping deliver precise nutrition and – in turn – produce milk more efficiently create less waste and reduce on-farm greenhouse gas emissions. The farms will also be eligible to apply for funds to implement sustainability projects while continuing to actively recruit DFA members throughout the partnership. In addition to using SCiO cups farmers participating in the program will have the chance to adopt other practices and technologies such as feed management enhancements and energy-efficient lighting.

“Pizza Hut has a long history of implementing industry-leading innovation” said Penny Shaheen Head of Food Innovation and Technology at Pizza Hut. “With this sustainability initiative we’re able to utilize technology along with our dairy partners in a way that helps the environment while still delivering the iconic taste that pizza lovers have come to expect from our offerings.”

Since Pizza Hut’s inception in 1958 it has worked with the same family-owned business to supply 100% real cheese made with whole milk to top its pizza and that commitment to the highest-quality cheese will remain unchanged. With this announcement Pizza Hut will leverage its national scale by partnering with DFA and dairy suppliers to help make its supply chain more environmentally friendly by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

“In 2020 Dairy Farmers of America became the first U.S. dairy cooperative to set a science-based target to reduce both direct and value chain greenhouse gas emissions and this partnership with Pizza Hut and Dairy Farmers of America is an important piece in those continued efforts” said Hansel New director of sustainability programs at DFA. “We appreciate partners supporting our dairy farm families by investing in meaningful innovative technologies and practices that advance environmental stewardship while reducing farm-level greenhouse gas emissions.”

The project is also part of a broader strategy that will help all parties reach additional long-term sustainability goals:

Yum! and Pizza Hut: decrease GHG emissions 46% by 2030 with a focus on restaurants and supply chain and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

Dairy Farmers of America: 30% GHG emissions reduction across supply chain by 2030. DFA is also part of an industry-wide collaboration through the Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy to be greenhouse neutral or better by 2050.

This farm-level project builds on existing industry collaborations and partnerships. Since 2019 Yum! Brands has been a member of the Innovation Center’s Dairy Sustainability Alliance® a multi-stakeholder group consisting of companies and organizations from across the dairy community and others who want to contribute to dairy’s social responsibility journey. DFA is also an active member having joined in 2010.

“We are proud to work with Dairy Farmers of America in this innovative project” said Jon Hixson Chief Sustainability Officer and Vice President of Global Government Affairs at Yum! Brands. “U.S. dairy producers have set leading aspirations in sustainability and we are excited to partner with them in support of practices that improve the sustainability of the dairy supply chain.”

Pizza Hut and its parent company Yum Brands are partnering with Dairy Farmers of America (DFA) to launch a sustainability initiative aimed to help participating farmers reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.

The initiative will allow the DFA and dairy suppliers to engage in annual farm-level greenhouse gas and energy footprinting. The project will use the Farmers Assuring Responsible Management and Environmental Stewardship evaluation which estimates farm-level emissions and energy intensity using a scientific peer-reviewed model.

Once enrolled in the program farms will receive a SCiO cup a lab-grade matter analyzer that will allow farmers to evaluate their cows’ feed to provide precise nutrition and produce milk more efficiently. Pizza Hut said this will create less waste and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Additionally the farms will be able to apply for funds to implement other sustainability efforts including feed management enhancements and energy-efficient lighting and recruit DFA members.

The city has one restaurant already on East Dixon Boulevard and a second is planned for the former Zaxby’s location near Cleveland Mall four miles down the road.

The empty building was vacated last year when a new Zaxby's opened next door.

“We've approved a site plan for the Taco Bell at the Zaxby's location” said Walt Scharer planning and development services director for the city of Shelby. “We are waiting on building plans.”

Scharer said the old building will be demolished and a new Taco Bell constructed.

More:New Zaxby's to open Monday in Shelby

The site plans were approved within the last month but Scharer doesn’t know when the city will receive the building plans or when construction will begin.

A spokesperson for Taco Bell confirmed Monday that they will be opening a new store at 2005 E. Dixon Blvd.

""...it will most likely open in the Spring of 2023"" the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Star. ""The existing Shelby location will remain operating.""

In January of 2021 a new Zaxby’s opened next door to the former one which had been open for two decades.

“After 20 years Zaxby's asks franchisees to upgrade their locations or build a new store. Due to the popularity of the Zaxby's and its location in Shelby the licensee decided to build a larger updated and more customer-friendly location the community can enjoy” a Zaxby’s spokesman previously told The Star.

Taco Bell is an American-based chain of fast food restaurants founded in 1962 by Glen Bell in Irvine California. Taco Bell is a subsidiary of Yum! Brands Inc.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vMTg1MWZyYW5jaGlzZS5jb20vdGhlLWhpc3Rvcnktb2YtdGFjby1iZWxscy1zdHJhbmdlc3QtbWVudS1pdGVtLXRoZS1tZXhpY2FuLXBpenphLTI3MTkzNTXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The History of Taco Bell's Strangest Menu Item: The Mexican Pizza,"Since bringing back the once-staple menu item as an LTO in May Taco Bell has sold a whopping 20 million pizzas. But why are customers so hungry for this Italian-Mexican hybrid?

From celebrity endorsements to big marketing stunts  today’s QSR world is all about building buzz. And in recent years one of the most common strategies for getting customers talking has been relaunching nostalgic and beloved menu items from the ‘80s and ‘90s. These menu items like the coveted McRib  are to the fast food industry what big Hollywood remakes are to entertainment — appeal to generations both young and old by taking existing I.P. and making its return to theaters (or drive-thru windows) an exciting event.

But the latest example of this strategy is a little different than usual. Taco Bell recently brought back its wildly popular Mexican Pizza which was originally launched in the ‘80s but was only taken off the shelves in 2020. Still that hasn’t made Taco Bell customers any less excited about the return of the option.

The fast-food giant brought back the menu item in May as an LTO and has since sold more than 20 million pizzas nationwide — seven times the previous levels. Loyalty members were given access two days before full release and in that two-day window loyalty registrations grew 15 times over. Taco Bell’s U.S. same-store sales lifted 8% in Q2 despite inflation . The brand even announced it would be releasing a Mexican Pizza musical featuring Doja Cat and Dolly Parton exclusively on TikTok  although it has postponed the idea for the time being.

“The benefit of things like the Mexican Pizza is the connection it has with consumers the love they have for the product and the halo it provides to the brand” Yum! Brands CEO David Gibbs said during the company’s Q2 earnings call . “It’s just as much about the buzz that that creates and the relevance it creates for our brand as it is about the discrete amount of sales... And I think that is really our formula. We have got to be the most relevant brands in the industry and connecting with consumers the way Taco Bell has done in Q2. And you can see the results when that happens.”

So why do customers have such fond associations with Mexican Pizza? How did we get here?

The original concept of the ""Mexican-style pizza"" — a layer of ground beef and beans spread between two flat flour tortilla shells topped with cheese and pizza sauce — was born in 1984. Taco Bell introduced the new product under the name ""Mexican Pizza"" in several test markets in 1984 and early 1985. It was a hit and Taco Bell decided to roll out its Mexican Pizza nationwide.

After conducting consumer research in February 1985 Taco Bell found the term ""Mexican Pizza"" may have been turning some customers off because of its potential “spiciness.” So Taco Bell decided to change the name from ""Mexican Pizza"" to ""Pizzazz Pizza"" (not confusing at all right?). Pizzazz was meant to better encapsulate the product’s ""zest vim and liveliness"" while also being a play on pizza. Unfortunately for Taco Bell they weren’t the first ones to come up with this brilliant wordplay. The chain was sued by another pizza brand called Pizzazz Pizza  which resulted in the name reverting to what we see today: “Mexican Pizza.”



From there it was pretty much smooth sailing for the Mexican Pizza. The item remained a staple on the Taco Bell menu through 35 years of logo changes recipe revamps and marketing campaigns. Interestingly it was a particularly popular option for Taco Bell’s South Asian American customers .

And then seemingly overnight everything changed. As if 2020 couldn’t have been any worse in September of that year Taco Bell made the decision to discontinue the item all together as part of a streamlined menu strategy that in part was meant to cut down on waste. The press release explains that in Taco Bell's U.S. locations alone the packaging used for the Mexican Pizza produced over seven million pounds of paperboard material per year.

Customers weren’t having it and they made their opinion heard — there was even a change.org petition that racked up nearly 200000 supporters. Del Taco took advantage of the gap in the marketplace in April 2021 with the Crunchtada  but it didn’t quite hit at the same level.

That brings us to May 2022 when Taco Bell announced that the Mexican Pizza would return for a limited time. Pretty quickly it was clear that the chain had underestimated the fervor surrounding the Mexican Pizza and the item was discontinued once again due to a lack of supply. Luckily it looks like Taco Bell has learned its lesson — it was recently announced that the Mexican Pizza would return this fall as a permanent menu item. Mexican Pizza fans everywhere could rest easy knowing that the battle was won.

For other franchisors the Mexican Pizza saga may present a valuable lesson: that beloved menu items don’t need to be gone for 20 years to drum up demand. Although Burger King likely isn’t going to discontinue the Whopper for a few months just to create buzz around its return the trend does provide an interesting insight into how powerful a scarcity marketing strategy can be for today’s customers especially when it's centered around an item with as much history as the Mexican Pizza."

Several invasive species such as the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) are native to the Ponto-Caspian region which includes the Black Caspian and Azov Seas and were imported to North America by transoceanic ships. These species are known to have disrupted ecosystems around the world including those of the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River.

However the impacts of Ponto-Caspian invaders on native biodiversity although significant appear to have been less extensive in the St. Lawrence River than in the Great Lakes. This phenomenon might be explained by the river’s weaker conductivity.

Conductivity is the ability of water to conduct an electric current which results from a concentration of dissolved minerals. It is highly dependent on salinity the concentration of all salts dissolved in water.

This article is part of our series The St. Lawrence River: In depth. Don’t miss new articles on this mythical river of remarkable beauty. Our experts look at its fauna flora and history and the issues it faces. This series is brought to you by La Conversation.

Invasive species that originate from the Ponto-Caspian region have evolved in brackish waters which are less salty than seawater but still rich in essential minerals. When they are introduced into habitats that are low in minerals or weaker conductivity as in the river these species have difficulty surviving.

We are studying how conductivity gradients in the St. Lawrence River promote aquatic diversity in the presence of invasive species. These gradients provide native species with habitats that are unfavourable for invasive species.

The round goby invades the St. Lawrence

The round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) Ponto-Caspian invader is an established fish that has become widespread in the St. Lawrence River within the past two decades following its introduction into the Great Lakes. It has disrupted coastal fish communities because it reproduces quickly and frequently is highly adaptable to various habitat conditions and behaves aggressively.

The presence of the goby has been associated with the decline of several native fish species such as the Johnny Darter and the spread of certain fish diseases such as viral hemorrhagic septicemia. There is also evidence that the round goby contributes to the spread of avian botulism and the bioaccumulation of contaminants such as mercury in the aquatic food chain.

In addition these impacts are expected to worsen with climate change as round goby growth rates will increase faster with the rise of water temperatures in the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River.

Most of the ecological impacts of the round goby on native fish and macroinvertebrate communities (animals without a spine and visible to the naked eye) appear to depend on its density and invasion status. The impacts will be greater in areas where the species has been present in large numbers and for a long time.

Since the spatial distribution of several invasive species (including zebra mussels) in the St. Lawrence River appears to be influenced by the water conductivity gradient it is debatable whether this habitat characteristic represents a limiting factor in the invasion of freshwater environments by the round goby.

A matter of refuge

Environmental heterogeneity namely the variation in the physical and ecological characteristics of the landscape can play an important role in maintaining the diversity and abundance of native species in goby-invaded ecosystems. In fact this diversity can generate refuges for native species in the face of biological invasion when environmental conditions such as water conductivity restrict the abundance and impact of invaders by limiting their survival.

There are compelling studies — but of a limited number — on the Great Lakes that suggest that wetlands (seagrass beds and marshes) are unfavourable to some key aquatic invaders notably the round goby.

(Cristina Charette)

Our work has also shown that both habitat types the conductivity gradient and local wetlands limit round goby dominance. Even in places where they are present in large numbers wetlands help mitigate their negative effects on native communities. This may be linked to the structuring effects of vegetation which provide favourable conditions for maintaining fish and macroinvertebrate diversity.

Important tools for biodiversity conservation

The results of this study while highly relevant to the risk assessment and management of round goby were based on observations of a limited portion of the St. Lawrence River. Two major fish inventories along the St. Lawrence the Fish Identification Nearshore Survey (FINS) and the Ichthyological Monitoring Network (RSI) conducted by the River Institute and the Québec Department of Forestry Wildlife and Parks respectively now provide the opportunity to test the phenomenon on a much larger spatial scale — practically the entire freshwater portion of the St. Lawrence River.

Our research is one of the few freshwater studies to date that has addressed the essential but little-known role of refuges in an ecosystem with diverse environmental conditions. In addition to reducing the effects of the invasion on native biodiversity these areas ensure their sustainability. The mitigation of the presence and quantity of the round goby in the St. Lawrence River by low-conductivity waters and the presence of wetlands present a conservation tool that can contribute to the preservation of this culturally and socio-economically important river system.

(Stephany Hildebrand)

In addition the relationship between goby abundance and water conductivity is a simple but informative tool in assessing the risk to habitats that are not yet colonized by the round goby (such as the St. Lawrence River tributaries) that may harbour fish species at risk including the eastern sand darter (Ammocrypta pelludica) the channel darter (Percina copelandi) and the pugnose shiner (Notropis anogenus).

Our research highlights the importance of preserving a wide variety of natural habitats including wetlands for their beneficial effects in mitigating the negative impacts of biological invasions on freshwater biodiversity.

In particular we recommend protecting the St. Lawrence River wetlands as a critical step in sustaining this ecosystem resource.

With elective procedure numbers rebounding after the darkest days of the COVID-19 pandemic sales at most of the world’s largest orthopedic device companies increased by double-digit percentages during their most recent fiscal years.

Here are the world’s 10 largest orthopedic device companies ranked by ortho business revenue pulled from their most recent annual reports:

Largest orthopedic device companies Annual revenue (% change) Headquarters 1 Stryker $17.1 billion (+19.2%) Kalamazoo Michigan 2 Johnson & Johnson – DePuy Synthes $8.6 billion (+10.6%) Locations: Raynham Massachusetts.; West Chester Pennsylvania; Warsaw Indiana; Palm Beach Gardens Florida 3 Zimmer Biomet (minus ZimVie spinoff) $6.8 billion (+11.6%) Warsaw Indiana 4 Medtronic – Cranial & Spinal Technologies $4.5 billion (+3.9%) Locations: Memphis Tennessee; Louisville Colorado 5 Smith+Nephew (Orthopaedics + Sports Medicine) $3.7 billion (+14.3%) London 6 Enovis (Formerly Colfax’s Medical Technology segment including DJO) $1.4 billion (+27.3%) Wilmington Delaware 7 NuVasive $1.1 billion (+8%) San Diego 8 Globus Medical $958 million (+21.4%) Audubon Pennsylvania 9 ZimVie (Spine business) $540 million (+2.1%) Westminster Colorado 10 Orthofix $465 million (+14.2%) Lewisville Texas

And here is more about how the world’s biggest orthopedic companies are doing:

1. Stryker

With a strong order book for capital equipment and implant sales momentum Stryker (NYSE:SYK) recently boosted its revenue projections for 2022 predicting organic sales growth between 8% and 9% for the year. The world’s largest orthopedic device company however scaled back its earnings range amid the foreign currency exchange environment. Like most manufacturers Stryker said its supply chain is presenting challenges too.

“We continue to invest in R&D at a healthy ratio of sales demonstrating our continued focus on new product pipelines” CEO Kevin Lobo said during Stryker’s Q2 2022 earnings call on July 26. Company officials are also excited about the synergies that Stryker is already realizing from its $3.1 billion acquisition of Vocera Communications a provider of digital care coordination and communication offerings including the hands-free Vocera Smartbadge.

At DeviceTalks Boston in May four Stryker executives shared how the company thinks differently about medical product development and how health care providers and patients will ultimately use them.

2. Johnson & Johnson – DePuy Synthes

DePuy Synthes officials see the Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) business better enabling the personalization of orthopedic surgery creating better outcomes. That was a big takeaway when five J&J executives spoke about the shift toward digital at DeviceTalks Boston in May. “We’re not adopting technology just for technology’s sake. We’re adopting technology because it’s meeting clear unmet needs” said Rajit Kamal worldwide president sports medicine/shoulder reconstruction at DePuy Synthes.

Recent DePuy Synthes wins include the Inhance system receiving FDA clearance for total shoulder arthroplasty and adding the Cementless Fixed Bearing knee and Medial Stabilized knee to its Attune Knee portfolio. The company is betting it can compete in the ortho surgical robotics space with its Velys system which could help reduce the physical burden of orthopedic surgery. Earlier this year DePuy Synthes acquired Tennessee-based CrossRoads Extremity Systems and its range of procedure-specific sterile-packed implants and instrumentation systems cleared for lower extremity indications.

3. Zimmer Biomet

Zimmer Biomet (NYSE:ZBH) has had a great deal of news over the past year. It spun off its dental and spine business as ZimVie in March. ZB has also introduced new ortho surgical offerings based on AI and mixed reality. They are also pioneering smart ortho device implants being the first to offer smart knee implants.

In early August Zimmer Biomet reported second-quarter results that handily beat the consensus forecast on Wall Street upping its full-year forecast for 2022. A host of U.S. companies in medtech and other industries are reporting macroeconomic headwinds related to foreign exchange rates inflation supply chain challenges and more. ZB officials however appear to be making a bet that they can innovate their way out of rough economic seas. CEO Bryan Hanson pretty much said it during the company’s Q2 earnings call: “We believe our focus on innovation and the transformation of our business continues to position us well for long-term growth and continued delivery for our shareholders.”

4. Medtronic – Cranial & Spinal Technologies

In the spine space Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) had record quarters with its Mazor robotics system and StealthStation navigation system CEO Geoff Martha said during the medtech giant’s Q4 earnings call in May. “The ongoing launch of our Catalyft expandable titanium interbody system and the rollout of our enabling technologies continues to differentiate us in spine” Martha said. Recent spine wins for Medtronic include FDA 510(k) clearance and breakthrough device designation for its LigaPASS 2.0 ligament augmentation system for spine surgery and FDA clearance of its UNiD spine analyzer v4.0 planning platform. On the flip side the spine business was facing slowing distributor purchases in China ahead of a potential national volume-based tender as the Chinese government seeks to rein in healthcare costs.

5. Smith+Nephew

The most recent earnings report from Smith+Nephew (NYSE: SNN) showed an overall loss in revenue and its orthopedics business experienced a revenue decline of 1.1% in Q2 noting supply chain challenges and a new hip and knee volume-based procurement program in China. However company officials say they have a strategy to grow the orthopedics business.

“Orthopedics continues to be held back by execution and supply chain challenges” CEO Deepak Nath said in a recent earnings release. “In the last three months I have reviewed the business and together with the team we have developed a comprehensive plan to drive better execution at pace.”

The plan includes initiatives such as driving operational benefits in orthopedics and transforming the business. Smith+Nephew also recently invested in its orthopedics business by building a new $100 million manufacturing facility in Malaysia.

6. Enovis

Enovis (NYSE:ENOV) — the parent company of DJO Global — completed acquisitions and spinoffs this year to strengthen its position in the orthopedic device industry.

In May the company acquired assets of Outcome-Based Technologies‘ hip and knee bracing portfolio adding the Excyabir hip brace and CryoKnee knee braces to its DonJoy bracing brand.

Enovis also completed the acquisition of Insight Medical and its FDA-cleared Arvis augmented reality platform for hip and knee replacement surgery earlier this month.

In early August the company reported Q2 results that beat The Street on earnings but missed on revenue. It joined the host of medtech companies scaling back earnings projections for the year amid macroeconomic headwinds.

7. NuVasive

NuVasive (Nasdaq:NUVA) remains on track to grow its revenue more than 6% in fiscal 2022 and its orthopedic technology is expected to drive the growth. However the company reduced its EPS guidance in early August amid the macroeconomic pressures that many device companies presently face.

Early this year NuVasive announced that its Attrax Putty had received FDA 510(k) clearance for expanded indications in thoracolumbar interbody spine surgery. NuVasive officials say the Attrax Putty is the first synthetic bone graft with U.S. FDA indications for thoracolumbar interbody fusion. The company also describes Attrax as a relatively inexpensive biologic option. The spine surgery tech company in July released some positive data around Attrax and Modulus XLIF a porous titanium interbody implant when it came to lateral lumbar interbody fusions. Nuvasive said the fully porous architecture provided a favorable environment for bone in-growth and supported a less invasive XLIF procedure that was clinically and economically beneficial.

In April NuVasive reported successful data that demonstrated significantly greater success rates with its Simplify disc at the 24-month follow-up compared to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion when used for two-level cervical total disc replacement. The implant allows for enhanced visualization through MRI postoperatively compared to alternative devices.

8. Globus Medical

Globus Medical (NYSE:GMED) during its second quarter delivered on a needed rebound after a Q1 earnings miss and a surprise CEO transition said BTIG analyst Ryan Zimmerman as he kept his Buy rating on GMED shares. “To some extent investors are flying blind in terms of where GMED is heading longer-term strategically (and how it reaccelerates core spine) but at the same time we expect GMED to drive growth through competitive rep hires pull through from Enabling Technology and new product introductions; all of which are expected to pick-up as we move into FY23.”

Globus Medical reaffirmed its full-year 2022 guidance of $1.025 billion in net sales and non-GAAP EPS of $2.10.

The company reached another milestone in its business earlier this year with the first shipments of its Excelsius3D imaging system. Globus Medical announced the first procedures using the system in May. The mobile X-ray system is designed for 2D fluoroscopy 2D digital radiography and 3D imaging of adult and pediatric patients. When combined with its ExcelsiusGPS the image-guided robotic navigation improves implant placement accuracy.

Early feedback was “extremely positive” CEO Dan Scavilla said in May. He called the imaging system “an excellent example of Globus Medical’s innovation engine which will drive momentum and provide a platform for continued growth as we progress in 2022 and beyond.”

9. ZimVie (spine business)

Zimmer Biomet’s latest spinoff ZimVie (NYSE:ZBH) became an independent public company on March 1 nearly 13 months after Zimmer Biomet announced the move.

ZimVie reported $540 million worth of spine sales for calendar year 2021 while the spinoff’s other business — dental — did $469 million for the year.

CEO Vafa Jamali earlier this year said there are opportunities for growth in the spine space but the efforts could take years to accomplish. Two examples of the growth opportunity are cervical disc replacement and pediatric scoliosis treatments.

The former Medtronic executive also set his sights on “some operational issues to fix within our spine business” saying ZimVie would exit several countries where the business has been unprofitable.

“That opens up a ton of management time and energy. It just frees us up. … We’re doing a lot of work with our inventory and how we manage our sets. So this really gives us a chance to sort of stabilize and then to grow from there.” Jamali said. “We’re going to have a year of resetting and sorting out all these pieces. And then you’ll see us accelerate on some of the more innovation-focused areas and goals.”

Facing greater than anticipated foreign exchange headwinds ZimVie announced during its Q2 earnings report that it is reducing its full-year revenue forecast to $915 to $930 million versus prior guidance of $1 billion.

10. Orthofix

Orthofix (Nasdaq:OFIX) named Kimberley Elting as its global orthopedics business president in April. Eluting was previously chief legal and development officer and held other leadership roles in the areas of regulatory and quality business development and corporate communications at the orthopedic implant purveyor.

In May Orthofix said it received FDA premarket approval (PMA) for its AccelStim bone healing therapy device. In July the company announced a licensing partnership with LimaCorporate to combine the limb-lengthening technology of Orthofix’s Fitbone intramedullary nail system with LimaCorporate’s proprietary patient-specific 3D-printed pelvic fixation device. The company most recently launched its Virtuos Lyograft autograft substitute and marked the first clinical use.

The company in early August lowered its financial outlook for the year. It now anticipates fiscal 2022 net sales to be in the range of $455 million to $465 million down from its previous outlook of $475 million to $490 million.

Said CEO Jon Serbousek: “We had solid operational execution despite the challenges that macro headwinds continue to present including continued hospital staffing shortages complex spine procedure softness and patients deferring care due to economic pressures. In addition currency fluctuations during the quarter dampened reported revenue results.”

ZTS,Zoetis,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9wZXQtaGVhbHRoLXJlY2Vzc2lvbi1yZXNpc3RhbnQtem9ldGlzLWNmby0xNjQxNDc0OTcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pet health 'has proven to be recession resistant': Zoetis CFO,"While some industries have proven to be vulnerable to the recent economic downturn and record inflation pet health care is not one of them.

“If you look at animal health historically it has proven to be recession resistant"" Wetteny Joseph chief financial officer of Zoetis (ZTS) a global animal health company said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). “The demographics of pet ownership have trended towards millennials and Gen Z and they place a higher premium on the health of their pets.”

Strong demand for animal health care products can be attributed to the increase in demand for pets during the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to a 2021 survey from the American Pet Products Association (APPA) the percentage of U.S. households that had pets increased in 2020 from 67% to an all-time high of 70% as more Americans sought out comforting companionship during the lockdown period.

Furthermore pet owners who took the survey also stated that they spent more on their pets now than they did before the onset of COVID-19. An estimated $123.6 billion was spent on pets in 2021 with $34.3 billion used towards veterinary care.

""Despite the broader uncertainty in the economic environment pet spending and the prioritization on pet health remains very strong"" Joseph said. ""And the underlying fundamentals of the industry remain strong.""

'We don't see any signs of slowing down'

For Zoetis an essential aspect of the company's business model is its medications being recommended by veterinarians.

The company reported a strong quarter with 8% operational growth in revenue and 9% in adjusted net income ""driven by a companion animal portfolio"" Joseph said while the companion animal business grew 14% operationally on a global level.

“Puppies and kittens need to go see the vet” he said. “That created a really high watermark if you will if you go back in the first half of last year. But as we tracked visits to the clinic over a number of years the visits in the second quarter were the fourth-highest of visits that we have on record. So it's just a matter of [comparison].""

Vet visits are down 1.3% YOY but revenue is up 6.4%. showing that owners are still willing to spend money on pet health. (Chart: AVMA)

Although visits to the vet are down roughly 1.3% year-over-year revenue is up 6.4% in that same time according to the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) meaning that when pet owners are taking their furry friends to the vet they're willing to spend money even as millions of Americans have started to pull back on spending in other consumer categories.

According to Joseph that's indicative of a ""much higher correlation"" to how Zoetis performs due to the innovation it brings to the market.

Story continues

""Given more pets and higher prioritization on the health of pets we expect that to continue to remain robust"" he said adding: ""We don't see any signs of slowing down.""
