How Scotchlite reflective materials work

3M Scotchlite Reflective Transfer Films are intended for use on high-performance safety garments. They help enhance the visibility of the wearer at night or in lowlight conditions when illuminated by a light source such as vehicle headlights or streetlights. 3M is a pioneer in developing the science behind retroreflection and has been advancing the technology in new and groundbreaking ways for over 80 years.

3M Scotchlite Reflective Material works by returning light rays back to the original source a result of the retroreflective properties of thousands of microscopic glass beads incorporated into the material. This means retroreflective materials appear brightest to an observer located near the original light source such as a car's headlights. Since very little light is scattered when the light is returned retroreflective materials enhance the contrast of the wearer to an observer located near the original light source.

According to an order from Circuit Judge William Ogletree all claims in the lawsuit have been resolved and all terms of the monetary settlement including previously existing settlements ""shall remain confidential"" between Gadsden Water and defendants 3M Company Shaw Industries Inc. Mohawk Carpet LLC Mohawk Industries Inc. and Industrial Chemicals Inc.

Gadsden Water Works and Sewer Board files lawsuit over water pollution

The lawsuit claimed the defendants were responsible for putting perfluorooctane sulfonate and perflurooctanic acid into the city's raw water supply. That caused Gadsden Water to have higher readings of those man-made chemicals according to press release at the time the suit was filed by the Beasley Allen Law Firm.

After the EPA issued new lifetime exposure limits for those chemicals in May 2016 eight water systems in Alabama received advisory warnings including Gadsden's. The advisory focused on PFOAs and PFOs the man-made chemical compounds used in the manufacture of non-stick stain-resistant and waterproofing coatings on fabric cookware firefighting foam and other consumer products the lawsuit said. According to attorneys for Gadsden Water the EPA says exposure to the chemicals even in trace amounts can promote serious health problems over time.

""The Gadsden Water Works and Sewer Board and its customers did not put these chemicals in the water. This lawsuit says very clearly that they should not be responsible for removing them either"" attorney Rhon Jones said.

GWW General Manager Chad Hare said the agency is pleased the lawsuit has been resolved.

""This is monumental for customers of Gadsden Water and all of Etowah County as the mutually agreed upon settlement will result in the construction of what will be the State of Alabama’s largest reverse osmosis treatment facility to provide our customers with PFAS-free drinking water"" Hare said.

""Our customers will not be asked to pay for the treatment required to remove a chemical that they did not place there"" he said. ""For the City of Gadsden this settlement represents a bright and clean future for economic development and growth.""

Hare said the authority is aggressively addressing construction of the treatment facility having voted already to authorize the him to solicit proposals from qualified engineering consulting firms for the design bid and construction administration of the new RO facility.

""The Water Works Board thanks its customers for their patience during this legal process"" Hare said.

Gadsden Water continues to update its website (www.gadsdenwater.org) when any new information is obtained regarding PFAS."

The congratulatory bundles haven’t stopped since Ralph grabbed this year’s Emmy for her supporting role in the mockumentary sitcom Abbott Elementary. “I am floating on cloud 999 ever since they said ‘Sheryl Lee Ralph’ from the Emmy stage” she says.

After nearly five decades in the business she was so shocked when her name was called that Quinta Brunson Tyler James Williams and other Abbott castmates had to ease her out of her seat and guide her up to the Microsoft Theater stage. In an acceptance speech for the ages she launched into song before declaring “this is what believing looks like … this is what striving looks like. Don’t you ever ever give up on you.”

The song she belted out was jazz vocalist Dianne Reeves’s Endangered Species a suitable choice considering Ralph is the only the second-ever Black woman to take home the trophy in this category. After Ralph’s win Jackée Harry another estimable peer reflected on her own “lonely experience” 35 years ago of becoming the first Black woman to win a supporting comedy actor Emmy for her vixen role in the neighborhood sitcom 227 – a part NBC had originally wanted Ralph to play. “It’s come full circle. Congrats Sheryl & welcome to the club” Harry tweeted.

The popular refrain on Ralph’s prize is that it was long overdue or a study in perseverance as she mentioned in her acceptance speech. But even that doesn’t quite capture why this 65-year-old mega-talent had been so criminally underappreciated to this point. “But isn’t that good?” she says. “Isn’t it such a blessing that I could remain relevant after all of these years?”

It’s not as if Ralph was some diamond in the rough. By 1974 she had been named one of the top 10 college women in America by Glamour magazine and was crowned Miss Black Teen-age New York.

Sidney Poitier gave her her first on-screen break in the 1977 hangout film A Piece of the Action. Scroll her IMDb page and you’ll see credits for soaps (Search for Tomorrow) sitcoms (Designing Women) and even animated flicks (Disney’s Oliver & Company). But it’s Abbott in which Ralph steals scenes as uptight doyenne Barbara Howard that cements her as a crossover star.



Ralph takes sport in guessing her fans’ ages based on which of her many credits they might know her from. Personally I considered blurting out “Ray Donovan” but couldn’t stop myself from sputtering about her turn as super stepmom Dee Mitchell on the 90s sitcom Moesha.

View image in fullscreen Sheryl Lee Ralph circa 1981 with Broadway Dreamgirls cast members Deborah Burrell and Loretta Devine. Photograph: Images Press/Getty Images

That sitcom a vehicle for the R&B star Brandy and a staple of the 90s Black sitcom boom has picked up new fans in the streaming era too – not least Ralph’s young Abbott scene partners. “One day we came back to work and this little boy looked at me and said ‘Miss Ralph I’ve been watching you my whole life’” she says.

All of which is to say: Ralph has always stood out. Her Broadway performance in the original production of Dreamgirls earned a 1982 Tony nomination after all. It’s just that in her chosen profession the slog is always somehow longer for Black actors. Eddie Murphy and Whoopi Goldberg are the rare Black actors who were recognized as prodigies and set on an unbroken road to superstardom.

But most every other Black actor who wasn’t already a musician (Ice Cube) or a sports hero (Jim Brown) has to endure has to survive. That too can be exhausting. “In the beginning they used to say [of Black actors] ‘Just give them a comedy because [Black people] love to laugh’” Ralph recalls. “‘The dramas … I don’t know. They’re kinda difficult.’ You would hear things like that that when you say them back now it’s hurtful.”

After A Piece of the Action Ralph didn’t land her next film credit until Oliver & Company which was released in 1988. That drought she says “really started me on TV and on stage”. During her Dreamgirls run Ralph fell into anorexia so great was the pressure to keep thin.

Most heartbreaking of all she and her castmates sold their stake in the franchise for a dollar. “We don’t participate in the greatness that is Dreamgirls” she laments. This is the same production that legitimized Beyoncé as a film actor won Jennifer Hudson an Oscar and is still drawing crowds. “A Chorus Line came about same as Dreamgirls” Ralph says. “The cast came together for a class-action suit and got their money for what they put into the show. But we just didn’t do that. We signed away our rights when we were very young. That’s just the way that happened.”

Earlier this year Ralph opened up to the Hollywood Reporter about the plight of being what she calls “Black famous”. In Jamaica where Ralph split her formative years and has always maintained a loyal following since that first film credit her Emmy win was both splashed on the front pages of national newspapers and much discussed on the morning shows.

In the US notoriety has been far more elusive. She shared an anecdote about her experience working on the short-lived 2019 CBS sitcom Fam and being confronted on the first day by an executive producer who asked without irony “So tell me what have you done?”

“I always knew that Black folks were aware of me and my work but I always knew I had a certain amount of crossover appeal too” she says.

On the night of Abbott’s second season premiere last month Ralph had a few friends over for a watch party including one ex-Fam stage manager who had witnessed that producer size up Ralph. “Sheryl look at you now” the friend said.

For another friend that story always seemed like the height of privilege.

“What always fascinated him about that moment was that it was his responsibility to know who you are no matter your color to make sure his production has absolute success with these millions that are being spent” Ralph says.

“Now when I look at success I look at it through the lens of ‘I know the next time I go on a new set they will know exactly who I am.’”

On Abbott Elementary show creator and executive producer Quinta Brunson plays a new teacher who unabashedly admires and looks to Ralph’s character for guidance. That’s not too far from reality. Ralph still remembers how awestruck Brunson was when she turned up on the set of A Black Lady Sketch Show in 2019 where Brunson was writing and co-starring at the time. “She just kept looking at me” Ralph remembers. “Like she was actually studying me.”

Soon after Brunson offered her a part in the sitcom she wrote about a ragtag group of Philadelphia primary school teachers fighting hopelessly against the systemic failures in public education. But Ralph says Brunson felt bad about having to ask her to read the Miss Howard part for executives to seal the deal. Worse Ralph didn’t think the character was especially meaty on the page. “I honestly thought I was going to be invisible” Ralph says.

Not only did that not happen but veteran teachers regularly tell her just how much her performance makes them feel seen. “People are like ‘I’m living for Miss Howard’” Ralph says. “I had no idea. Ugh it just makes me feel so good.”



The show debuted to little fanfare last December but eventually gained its audience and became the first ABC comedy to quadruple its rating after airing. Its pilot episode scored Brunson an Emmy for comedy writing. Like Ralph’s her golden moment also went viral albeit against her will. Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel thought it would be funny to double down a limp joke by lying on the floor next to Brunson while she delivered her acceptance speech. But no one laughed and Ralph in particular was not amused. After the awards show she sought Kimmel out and scolded him for his “disrespect”. A few days later he apologized to Brunson on his show for stealing her spotlight with his “dumb comedy bit”.

“I’m absolutely good with the resolution” Ralph says now. “As long as Quinta is fine with it I’m fine with it. But my initial reaction was my initial reaction! You know how mothers are.” For Moesha fans it was a vintage Dee Mitchell moment.

Ralph’s belated recognition syncs up nicely with Hollywood’s changing attitudes toward young Black stars. Zendaya (Euphoria) Lizzo (Watch Out for the Big Grrrls) and Jerrod Carmichael (Rothaniel) were also big winners on Emmy night. “It’s interesting to be in an era now of such Black excellence and abundance and for people to not look at you as a fluke any more” Ralph says. “But to be looked at as the real deal to be able to get these projects greenlit no matter what color the people are. It’s important.”

And she’s especially thrilled that she got to share her special night with Brunson – who at 32 is just getting warmed up in the business. “Quinta can do so many things” Ralph gushes. “Write. Produce. I’m sure there’s a bit of a director in her.”

Now at least there’s no more discounting the woman who helped set the stage for the current crop of Black prodigies in Hollywood. After Ralph’s Emmy win Beyoncé who starred in the 2006 theatrical production of Dreamgirls sent a bouquet and card “to the original Dreamgirl”. Jennifer Hudson who co-starred with Beyoncé in the film had Ralph on her daytime show – where Ralph taught Hudson how to do the Dreamgirls sway. (“I can’t believe I got to have that moment with you” Hudson shrieked.)

When we spoke Ralph had yet to celebrate properly with the original Dreamgirls who are still very much in the game. Jennifer Holliday has reprised her Tony-winning role as Effie White for a current Dreamgirls production in Atlanta. Loretta Devine who won an Emmy in 2011 for a guest spot on Grey’s Anatomy is still expanding her range on film and TV – most notably as the matriarch of the popular Netflix sitcom Family Reunion. It’s a testament to true resilience. But for Ralph at least there was no other option. “This is what I love to do” she says of performing. “And there was no way I was not going to do it.”

Given Ralph’s versatility it’s hard not to wonder whether she’ll soon be hoarding every award in sight. Egoting is a real possibility. “You’re not the only person who’s been saying it” she says. “You can win a Grammy many different ways – reading for example.” An enterprising music producer could breathe new life into In the Evening her 1984 pop single that remains a DJ favorite. “The work has been started to find the right projects.”

One of the offers Ralph has been mulling recently would put her back on a Broadway stage alongside the powerhouse actor-singer and Tony-winning phenom Audra McDonald. Now that Ralph is finally getting her flowers it’s only right that she get to play the one part that has eluded her throughout her career: the shoo-in.

“And you know what’s interesting? The way I got it people are standing ‘God the Emmys have never been so good until this moment’” she says. “They’re saying that in the year that I was there.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcHJhaXJpZW5ld3MuY29tLzI5Mzg3L2xpZmVzdHlsZS1lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2FiYm90dC1lbGVtZW50YXJ5LWhpZ2hsaWdodHMtaXNzdWVzLWluLXRoZS1lZHVjYXRpb24tc3lzdGVtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Abbott Elementary highlights issues in the education system,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcHJhaXJpZW5ld3MuY29tLzI5Mzg3L2xpZmVzdHlsZS1lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2FiYm90dC1lbGVtZW50YXJ5LWhpZ2hsaWdodHMtaXNzdWVzLWluLXRoZS1lZHVjYXRpb24tc3lzdGVtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC7CB6D70>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcHJhaXJpZW5ld3MuY29tLzI5Mzg3L2xpZmVzdHlsZS1lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2FiYm90dC1lbGVtZW50YXJ5LWhpZ2hsaWdodHMtaXNzdWVzLWluLXRoZS1lZHVjYXRpb24tc3lzdGVtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Early this week Teva Pharmaceutical parried a riposte from Eli Lilly.

Monday a judge in Boston swatted down Eli Lilly’s attempt to invalidate three Teva-held patents surrounding its migraine antibody Ajovy. The ruling tees up a trial slated for Oct. 18. In the case Teva alleges Lilly’s rival antibody Emgality infringes a trio of Ajovy patents according to Reuters.

Teva’s case has been running for four years and originally accused Lilly of treading on nine Ajovy patents. Teva and Lilly followed Amgen’s injectable Aimovig onto the CGRP migraine prevention market back in 2018 and after Emgality’s approval Teva filed suit.

All three companies’ drugs prevent migraines by blocking the release of calcitonin gene-related peptides.

Separately Lilly previously challenged Teva’s clutch of patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) with mixed results: The agency nixed six Teva patents in early 2020 while upholding the other three.

In light of the latest decision a Teva spokesperson told Reuters the company looks forward to the trial and plans to “defend [its] IP vigorously.” The company did not immediately respond to Fierce Pharma’s request for comment.

Teva has pinned big hopes on Ajovy as a growth driver amid a major business turnaround from CEO Kåre Schultz. Still the injectable’s performance has historically been weakest among the first wave of anti-CGRP drugs.

Nowadays those injectables face an even bigger threat in orals from Pfizer and AbbVie which also markets an oral migraine treatment in Ubrelvy. Pfizer's Nurtec for its part is approved as a dual therapy for both acute and preventive uses. Biohaven developed the drug and recently sold itself to drug behemoth Pfizer.

Meanwhile Lilly and Teva’s patent kerfuffle doesn’t end here. Last summer Teva filed a new lawsuit against Lilly in Massachusetts federal court the very same day it scored two new Ajovy patents from the U.S. PTO.

Teva argued Emgality infringes the new duo of patents and said at the time it was looking to block Lilly from making and selling its CGRP inhibitor in the U.S. Teva also asked for damages in the case.

Last year Lilly pulled down more than $577 million global sales of Emgality while Teva’s Ajovy snared $313 million over the same period. Amgen's Aimovig for its part also generated $313 million.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vbGl2YWJpbGl0eS5jb20vbWEvcXVpbmN5L2xvdmUtd2hlcmUteW91LWxpdmUvNi1yZWFzb25zLXRvLWNhbGwtcXVpbmN5LW1hLWhvbWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,6 Reasons to Call Quincy Massachusetts Home,"Looking to move to the City of Presidents?

The pharmaceutical industry is bolstering aid for student research training in the UK according to a survey produced by The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI).

The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI)’s survey identified that the sector is helping industry entrants by embracing hands-on training methods such as apprenticeships degree placements PhDs and post-doctoral researcher awards with data showing that apprentices being trained by pharmaceutical companies is the highest on record.

The survey used anonymous data to evaluate collaboration trends among academic organisations and key players in the industry. Pharmaceutical companies who contributed to the survey include AbbVie AstraZeneca Boehringer Ingelheim and GSK.

According to the survey apprentice numbers are three times higher than 2015 statistics across all skill levels from those entering the industry to master-qualified individuals. Moreover 70 percent of undergraduate placements fell within R&D and manufacturing. Other roles filled by undergraduates included marketing communications and IT.

Due to one placement of every four being funded for five years or more it was suggested that people new to the industry were adequately equipped with a breadth of relevant and essential knowledge and skills.

The benefits of exposing students to the industry this way enables both parties to share knowledge experience and provides students networking opportunities that can be difficult to obtain for such a competitive industry said ABPI.

The survey also acknowledged more people are pursuing higher apprenticeship qualifications at Bachelor and Master degree level which is double the number of level 6 and 7 apprenticeships done in 2019. It also found that The University of Bath UK hosted the most industry placements: 61 in 2019 and 2022. The University of Cambridge UK was found to host the most postdoctoral researchers in the UK (15 percent).

In addition 2022 statistics revealed a shift from regulatory being the most popular industrial area chosen by graduates in 2019 to pre-clinical R&D sectors being the preferred division.

ABPI’s Director of Examinations Skills and Education Policy Andrew Croydon explained: “There are huge benefits from collaboration between industry and academia. This includes the practical – like sharing of resources and the ability to use academic knowledge to solve real-world problems in industry. There are also intangible benefits like demystifying each other’s sectors and building networks with diverse teams from different scientific backgrounds.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wZW5wci5jb20vbmV3cy8yNzU3ODcyL2ludHJhdmVub3VzLWFuZXN0aGV0aWMtbWFya2V0LWN1cnJlbnQtc3RhdHVzLWFuZC1mdXR1cmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intravenous Anesthetic Market Current Status and Future Prospects (2022-2029)-AstraZeneca Fresenius-Kabi AbbVie ...,"Intravenous Anesthetic Market Current Status and Future Prospects (2022-2029)-AstraZeneca Fresenius-Kabi AbbVie Baxter Healthcare B.Braun Mylan Hengrui

(Photo: Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Accenture (NYSE: ACN) is working with Mars the global leader in confectionary food and pet care products and services to transform and modernize its global manufacturing operations with artificial intelligence (AI) cloud edge technology and digital twins.

Accenture and Mars have been trialing digital twins for Mars’ manufacturing operations since late 2020. Digital twins are virtual representations of machines products or processes. Fed with real-time data they can predict and optimize production processes and equipment performance from reliability to quality to energy efficiency. Applied to its manufacturing plants digital twins will enable Mars to simulate and validate the results of product and factory adjustments before allocating time and resources in the physical space.

The companies tested a digital twin to reduce instances of over-filling packages a common problem in the food industry. The digital twin gave Mars a bird’s-eye view of the production lines at one of its factories in Illinois. The twin fed sensor data from manufacturing machinery into a predictive analytics model which allowed factory line operators to monitor events in real-time and adjust the filling process. After the successful test Accenture and Mars introduced the solution across the U.S. and developed similar solutions for its pet care business in Europe and China.

Under the new agreement Accenture and Mars will work together to apply digital twin technology and models to the company’s manufacturing facilities globally. This will give Mars factory line operators real-time insights into current and predictive performance. Mars plans to apply them to dozens of use cases over the next three years.

Over the next two years Accenture and Mars will create a new cloud platform for manufacturing applications data and artificial intelligence (AI) to lay the foundation for its vision of the “Factory of the Future.” The new platform will provide next-generation robotics AI and automation capabilities at the edge to make Mars manufacturing operations significantly more efficient and address essential sustainability goals such as water stewardship and reducing waste and total greenhouse gas emissions.

William Beery vice president and global CIO at Mars Wrigley said “Our collaboration with Accenture combined with our partnership with Microsoft enables us to scale digital twin technology to reach this goal delivering not just significant cost savings and sustainability but preparing our manufacturing operations for the future of work.”

Larry Thomas a senior managing director at Accenture and client account lead for Mars adds “Our work with Mars is about using the power of data cloud and edge computing to modernize factories boost business agility in response to change and put power in the hands of Mars Associates so they can make informed decisions faster.”

Accenture brings cloud engineering manufacturing and supply chain capabilities to the project. It also works closely with Microsoft to leverage the Azure platform and Accenture’s proprietary edge accelerators. Earlier this year Accenture was named Microsoft’s 2022 Manufacturing & Supply Chain Partner of the Year.

Thiago Veiga senior director of Digital Supply R&D & Procurement at Mars Inc. said “We at Mars are constantly looking for innovative and sustainable ways to create value in our end-to-end supply chain and digital manufacturing is a key priority.”

Simon Osborne a managing director at Accenture leading its digital twin work with Mars said “The problems we’re solving aren’t new; what’s new is how we use advanced technologies to get real-time data into operators’ hands and apply AI to help them make decisions before problems occur. While many companies are beginning to experiment with digital twins what sets this project apart is the speed and scaling of the technology across Mars’ operations globally.”

As a result several organizations are not slowing down in adopting these new technologies to revamp and optimize their businesses to meet future demands.

Not ready to be left behind in a world of business that is aggressively driven by these new technologies Mars the well-known confectionery food and pet care products manufacturer recently announced a partnership with Accenture a professional services company in digital cloud and security to remodel its manufacturing operations.

The two companies have been working on digital twin technology since 2020 and hope to harness it in manufacturing plants. This technology helps businesses afford digital representation of their products machines and processes. Through Accenture Mars hopes to optimize its manufacturing plants by simulating and validating the results of product and factory adjustments before allocating time and resources in the physical space.

Before this partnership announcement both companies had tested a digital twin to reduce instances of over-filling packages which the companies saw as a common problem in the food industry.

In conducting the test sensor data was pulled from the manufacturing machinery and fed into a predictive analytics model. This gave the factory operators a better insight into real-time events for adjusting the filling process. The success recorded after the test led Accenture and Mars to introduce the digital twin solution across the U.S. and also made both companies develop and deploy similar solutions for Mars’ pet care business in Europe and China.

How the partnership will play out

Under this new partnership arrangement Mars will be tapping into Accenture’s technological innovations in the digital twin AI edge and cloud to facilitate its manufacturing facilities worldwide. In addition it is hoped that the digital twin model provided by Accenture would provide Mars factory operators with real-time insights and analytics into current and predictive performance.

“The problems we’re solving aren’t new; what’s new is how we use advanced technologies to get real-time data into operators’ hands and apply AI to help them make decisions before problems occur” said Simon Osborne a managing director at Accenture leading its digital twin project with Mars. “While many companies are beginning to experiment with digital twin what sets this project apart is the speed and scaling of the technology across Mars’ operations globally.”

This new partnership will also see Accenture and Mars create and deploy a new cloud platform for manufacturing applications data and AI to establish what they call a “factory of the future.” The companies believe that the new platform will provide next-generation robotics AI and automation capabilities at the edge to make Mars manufacturing operations more efficient. The platform is also expected to help meet essential sustainability goals such as water stewardship and reducing waste and total greenhouse gas emissions.

“Our collaboration with Accenture combined with our partnership with Microsoft enables us to scale digital twin technology to reach this goal delivering not just significant cost savings and sustainability but preparing our manufacturing operations for the future of work” said William Beery vice president and global CIO at Mars.

Where does this partnership leave Mars and Accenture?

Mars has taken significant strides over the years to try and improve its manufacturing processes using innovative technologies.

“We at Mars are constantly looking for innovative and sustainable ways to create value in our end-to-end supply chain and digital manufacturing is a key priority” explained Thiago Veiga senior director of digital supply R&D and procurement at Mars.

In 2021 the company made public its agreement to set up what they tagged “a digital first” agreement with Microsoft and their partners. The move was aimed at expanding a unified cloud and data foundation across Mars’ business operations.

With the global confectionery market projected to grow from $194.37 billion in 2021 to $242.53 billion in 2028 at a CAGR of 3.8% we may be witnessing a major push from Mars to nudge the key players in the market like The Hershey Company Nestlé and Mondelez International. Although this might take some time to happen with Accenture bringing cloud edge and AI that will boost manufacturing and supply chain capabilities Mars could be on a journey to gain a good spot in the global confectionery pet care and food production market share.

With this partnership Accenture hopes to add to the pool of its growing global partnerships. Earlier this year the company announced that it would be joining forces with Microsoft and Avanade to tackle climate change. With climate change widely regarded as one of the most critical and urgent challenges facing businesses Accenture’s partnership with Microsoft and Avanade will provide solutions to help organizations transform their operations products and services in a way that will help cut greenhouse gas emissions.

Similarly there have been announcements of collaborations with Toshiba to drive green transformation and the acquisition of Blackcomb Consultants and Stellantis’ World Class Manufacturing Training & Consulting. All of these point to the fact that Accenture is on a business expansion mission. It also suggests that we might continue to witness more collaborations and acquisitions from them in the future."

As such it aims for a smoother workflow of documents for Internet use and archival.

Ease-of-use often comes down to familiarity with the interface. Where Adobe's designs have become the de-facto standard for graphics applications for business tools Microsoft is the default. Since Office 2007 that default has used a ribbon which is what Nuance's Power PDF adopts. The big advantage of the ribbon is the quick access to a large number of tools and options without mining down through menus.

(Image credit: Nuance)

For example to extract a page from a multipage PDF in Acrobat Pro XI you need to show page thumbnails right-click on the thumbnail of the section you want and select Extract pages from the menu. In Power PDF Extract pages is on the Home ribbon; just click it.

Both of the programs include Optical Character Recognition (OCR) so both can be used to convert scans and image PDFs into searchable ones. Once searchable PDFs are available both applications can also search them but Power PDF includes 'Look Like Search' which can discover particular formats of text.

It offers pre-defined profiles for emails dates and phone and credit card numbers and it's possible to create your own patterns for specific text or numbers. It gives a lot more flexibility in finding information within a PDF.

Both applications can be used to annotate PDF documents with sticky notes but Power PDF can do this from speech as well as a keyboard. Using Dragon Notes part of the stable of Nuance's speech recognition tools you can quickly mark up documents for review or instruction. This is of most value to those who use speech recognition in other contexts too.

Using a PDF creator for archival is a lot easier if you can automate the process. Both applications support batch processing and do it in much the same way by offering a selection of operations from which you build a custom list to complete the task you want to automate. Acrobat Pro XI still has the more comprehensive list of commands including adding text images and backgrounds and applying encryption during a batch run.

Power PDF has a useful extra feature though where you can set up a Watch Folder. The application then monitors the named folder and automatically converts files to PDF – Normal or Searchable Image – and stores them in a second named folder. This is a useful set-and-forget feature if you have a lot of regular archives to generate.

Document assembly is easy in both programs with drag and drop creation using thumbnails of the pages you want to add. Pages can be reordered in the same way and both PDF Portfolios and the earlier PDF packages are available. PDF and PDF/A are supported with several levels of conformance.

Even with its advantages Power PDF remains a lot cheaper than Adobe Acrobat XI. The standard version of Acrobat XI costs £279 while Power PDF Standard is £80 - more than 70 percent cheaper. Acrobat Pro comes in at £449 while Power PDF Advanced costs more than 65 percent less at £140.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNvZnR3YXJlcmVwb3J0LmNvbS9jYW52YS1oYXMtaXRzLXdvcmstY3V0LW91dC1mb3ItaXQtYWZ0ZXItYWRvYmVzLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uLW9mLWZpZ21hL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Canva Has Its Work Cut Out for It After Adobe’s Acquisition of Figma,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.thesoftwarereport.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /canva-has-its-work-cut-out-for-it-after-adobes-acquisition-of-figma/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC92AB6D0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNvZnR3YXJlcmVwb3J0LmNvbS9jYW52YS1oYXMtaXRzLXdvcmstY3V0LW91dC1mb3ItaXQtYWZ0ZXItYWRvYmVzLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uLW9mLWZpZ21hL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vc25lYWtlcm5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMDUvbmlrZS1zYi1kdW5rLWxvdy1hZG9iZS1kdjU0MjktNjAwL9IBRWh0dHBzOi8vc25lYWtlcm5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMDUvbmlrZS1zYi1kdW5rLWxvdy1hZG9iZS1kdjU0MjktNjAwLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike SB Dunk Low “Adobe” Set To Release In 2023,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vc25lYWtlcm5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMDUvbmlrZS1zYi1kdW5rLWxvdy1hZG9iZS1kdjU0MjktNjAwL9IBRWh0dHBzOi8vc25lYWtlcm5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMDUvbmlrZS1zYi1kdW5rLWxvdy1hZG9iZS1kdjU0MjktNjAwLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC92AB940>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vc25lYWtlcm5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMDUvbmlrZS1zYi1kdW5rLWxvdy1hZG9iZS1kdjU0MjktNjAwL9IBRWh0dHBzOi8vc25lYWtlcm5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMDUvbmlrZS1zYi1kdW5rLWxvdy1hZG9iZS1kdjU0MjktNjAwLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzEwL25pa2Utc2ItZHVuay1sb3ctYWRvYmUtZHY1NDI5LTYwMC1yZWxlYXNlLWRhdGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike SB Dunk Low Adobe DV5429-600 Release Date,"Major initiatives are in the pipeline for Nike and its SB category such as an “Orange Lobster” colorway with Concepts new project with HUF and a rumored team-up with Mexican beverage imprint Jarritos.

Base layers are styled with a tonal aesthetic and arrive formed with sultry suedes and canvas both of which are fitted with its titular shade. The former makes up the overlays that arrive on the forefoot throat and heels while the latter constructs the toe boxes and quarter panels. The interior of the kicks is where things get more playful. Mesh liners are done up in a soft white hue while the insoles are printed with graphics that associate with adobe building blocks. Graphics of the Dunk silhouette adobe bricks building blueprints and construction tools are laid out across the length of the insoles and paired up next to Nike SB branding.

The company’s contract chip-manufacturing unit is looking to triple its revenue by that year from the 2021 level.

That will require several technological leaps and further inroads into the US market for outsourced chips.

The South Korean chip giant is building a second plant in Texas as competition with TSMC and Intel heats up in the foundry business.

READ NEXT Even lingering chip shortages can’t knock Intel and Samsung down

In the chip race South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co and US-based Intel Corp have been locked in a fierce rivalry for many years — but the former still ranks as the world’s largest chip maker by revenue. Being at the top isn’t stopping Samsung from further strengthening its position though especially in the US market. This week Samsung announced an aggressive five-year plan to further lure US chip buyers — this time with more advanced technology.

Samsung has recently been floating the idea of a broad expansion of semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the US a possibly significant step in bolstering domestic capabilities. The leading maker of memory chips laid out potential plans to spend almost US$200 billion on 11 plants in a series of filings in Texas in July this year. Two of the units would be in Austin and nine would be in Taylor where Samsung has already unveiled plans to spend US$17 billion on an advanced facility.

This time around the company’s chip contract-manufacturing unit – known as a foundry – is aiming to take the lead in advanced chipmaking by starting mass production of second-generation 3nm chips in 2024 and then 2nm parts in 2025 eventually setting the stage for the 1.4nm products two years later in 2027. When Samsung began mass producing chips with 3nm technology in June the company said it was in talks with potential customers including Qualcomm Tesla and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).

But it is fair to note that Samsung has actually had difficulties in meeting clients’ expectations for foundry yields in recent years. Analysts believe the company had pushed advanced technology too quickly to compete with TSMC but had suffered from having less experience with the long-term client cooperation needed in contract manufacturing.

Samsung even lost out to TSMC on an Nvidia Corp order to produce the RTX 40 series of graphics cards which moved to a 4-nanometre process. But it came out strong and now aims to triple its capacity of leading-edge manufacturing by 2027. Samsung Foundry is also looking to triple its revenue by that year from the 2021 level senior vice-president Moonsoo Kang said at a briefing on Monday in San Jose California.

In order to get there the business will need to make several technological leaps and further inroads in the US market for outsourced chips. Its decision to manufacture in America is part of Samsung’s pitch to its US customers. But the competition is only expected to intensify further with TSMC also beefing up its US presence while Intel which Samsung overtook to become the world’s biggest chip maker is adding capacity in both the US and Europe – part of an effort to balance the industry’s heavy reliance on Asian manufacturing.

Overall the mood of the chip industry is rather gloomy with Samsung warning that the semiconductor sector could be in for a challenging rest of the year. The outlook for Samsung in the second half of the year is gloomy too and the company has yet to see momentum on a possible recovery next year. Even rival chipmakers such as SK Hynix Inc. and Micron Technology Inc have cautioned about slowing demand in recent weeks."

For regular readers of this site many of those changes will be well known. From the way lithium battery prices fell and fell for years before the rise in demand converged with pandemic-driven logistics challenges to arrest that decline to how energy storage is finally becoming recognised around the world as an important tool in the energy transition unlocking some – if not yet all – of its potential.

We begin our series of ‘in conversation’ articles with a chat with Kiran Kumaraswamy Fluence’s VP of growth and head of commercial.

On the opening day of the show we saw you speaking on a panel about long-duration energy storage (LDES). There has undoubtedly been huge interest in LDES at the show and around the industry. One of your thoughts was that LDES technologies need to be able to demonstrate qualities that go beyond or are fundamentally different to what lithium-ion offers.

Kiran Kumaraswamy: In general the volatility in lithium pricing has also sparked a renewed type of interest on the non-lithium technology side which is genuine.

But in order to be of high value in the segment you have to figure out what type of market needs these technologies address and there are certain use cases that actually have a lot of promise.

Like on the transmission side using energy storage as a transmission asset and on providing let’s say 24/7 or ‘around-the-clock’ renewable energy using the combination of resources wind solar and storage to create some type of hybrid system that can deliver full renewable energy across a whole spectrum of time.

The extreme case of that could be that you do that with time matched renewables also so that it’s not that you’re on an average providing 24/7 but you have matching timestamps and you’re delivering it 24/7.

The approach that long duration has to potentially take is to figure out the market application that makes the most amount of sense. It’s very likely that either the market construct or the rules are not in place for this technology to get awarded appropriately in the marketplace. But once you have a very strong view on the value proposition that you bring to the grid with the long-duration storage then you go figure out ways to make that happen in the marketplace.

It sounds like something Fluence is looking very closely at. How much of a limiting factor is bankability for some of these newer technologies?

Bankability is a big limiting piece honestly. Lithium has a significant advantage in that it has a very deep supply chain and banks that are willing to stand behind that and so it is one of those hurdles that the alternate non-lithium technology base has to overcome.

Again if you coalesce around what the use case is and then improve the technology out through its first few installations that probably is a pathway towards getting there but it is certainly a hurdle to overcome.

One source a little while ago told us that the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) could be a boost for those alternative technologies. The IRA will introduce an investment tax credit (ITC) incentive programme for standalone energy storage along with domestic manufacturing incentives from the IRA and other legislation like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. We’ll have to wait and see what the details around the ITC will be but what are your thoughts on the IRA which we saw you’d celebrated the passing of at a special White House event recently?

I think it’s remarkable what we’ve achieved on the IRA itself. It’s 10 years of certainty that we’ve developed for this entire marketplace. You can see it in the posture of people at the show. People are beaming with confidence and it’s remarkable to see. I was told that there’s 20000 people here (the final attendance figures at RE+ turned out to be in excess of 27000).

Getting the standalone storage investment tax credit was a massive victory for us. What you have for the first time is a decoupling of development timeframes from having to worry about only interconnection issues on the storage side.

Because previously if you did renewables-plus-storage you would think about development from the perspective of getting land and getting permits and going through interconnection in a combined fashion to avail the ITCs.

Now you have a different dynamic because you’ve decoupled the solar development pathway and storage doesn’t require as much land as solar does. The only piece that you now have to solve is this interconnection piece which takes quite a long time but it’s a very different dynamic to solve for.

How that actually shows up in the marketplace we have to wait and watch over the course of the next 18 to 24 months in terms of what dynamic that it creates. That’s one impact of IRA.

The other one is that the impact of the IRA on the target addressable market for energy storage is significant in the United States. I think that our leading analysts’ estimates say that the market for standalone energy storage is going to go up to something like 140GW [cumulative installations] by 2030. It was [forecast at] around 70GW to 75GW previously.

The market has basically doubled. That is extraordinary it puts this market at a place that nobody ever thought it would be.

How do you think the industry will adapt to the changing dynamics of the market?

There’s going to be many many plays oriented around how people develop their commercial go-to-market how people develop technology pathways how business models evolve over time how companies take advantage of the direct pay because they don’t need a tax equity partner for the first time.

All of those have to form in the next 18 to 24 months. People are still wrapping their head around many of the facets of what the IRAs provisions are figuring out options on how to position themselves on each of these factors whether it’s on the commercial go-to-market technology side on business models to transact financials all of it together.

That means that on the technology side too companies will be looking at how to develop more domestic manufacturing and how to source many of these materials in a manner that maximises the usage of these available ITCs.

Fluence for instance we have announced our manufacturing of some of the products in the US and so we’re working with a partner to actually make this happen. I think it’s going to be a very exciting time.

What sort of level of vertical integration might Fluence target with that strategy?

Some of that will be confidential information but we are certainly looking at US manufacturing of some of the products.

Presumably some of the decisions around that will also be made a little later once the company knows how the incentives will work for producing or using US-made content?

I think so. One other thing I learned from my trip to the White House is that the amount of time that it might take for the IRS to put out actual guidance on this topic could actually be quite significant.

They have to draft a lot of clarifications on the rules. The law is signed right now but the intent of the law has to show up in any rules the IRS and Treasury Department actually write down.

How long that takes is anybody’s guess. In today’s market it could take six months it could take eight months it could take 12 months. Nobody knows and that’s going to have an impact on what is applicable and what’s not happening for this credit.

Fluence is obviously a global company with projects in various markets around the world. In Europe it’s been interesting to see the 200MW/200MWh of battery storage across four separate systems the company is supplying in Lithuania take shape for transmission operator LitGrid. It’s a rare example of energy storage being used as a transmission system asset.

That’s an important project that started not long before Russia’s invasion of the Ukraine with Lithuania and other Baltic countries aiming for greater grid synchronisation with one another and with Europe long before the war began. What is this project – and perhaps others like it – proving?

As a company we are investing in developing product and technology capabilities in the segment on storage as a transmission asset.

Broadly within Europe we see that application catching a lot of traction. The interest by the transmission owning companies to utilise energy storage to add reliability and resiliency for the system is increasing.

Think about it this way the problem that we solve on the generation side and the problem that we solve on the transmission side are identical.

We build generation and transmission for the one-hour peak that happens in 8760 hours (of the year in total). We build the church for Christmas Day: it is so large because during Christmas Day we want everybody to get a seat nobody has to stand. On Christmas Day it’s perfect but any other day it’s too big.

Whether it’s the generation side where you build peaking generation plants or on the transmission side where you build transmission lines to satisfy the peak the problem is identical.

So the next time you’re investing in let’s say a US$300 million to US$500 million transmission project people will have to ask if there was a more efficient way of solving these problems. Now that’s not to say that you don’t need backbone transmission. There’s a lot of transmission that we need to build in all parts of the world but we also have to consistently keep asking the question how do we improve the utilisation of the existing transmission grid?

That’s where the use of technology like fast acting battery energy storage has huge potential.

I guess it’s fair to say any sort of transmission infrastructure investment decisions will be made on a cautious basis and Fluence is bullish on the potential of batteries as a transmission asset. What are the limiting factors storage faces in penetrating that market opportunity?

I think the regulatory considerations are the limiting factor. This is an area where having regulations that clarify the use of storage for this application would be incredibly helpful in a market like the US.

It is a slow-moving market in that for example the GridBoosters (transmission level projects in Germany for TSOs) have been in development the last two years or three years they’re just beginning to transact right now. Chile has something similar to that too.

It’s an extraordinary value proposition but these things take time because they need to make their way into the national or regional transmission expansion plan and then they need to be approved by the regulatory body in those regions or in those countries and then they need to be procured and put into service.

It’s a long cycle but I’m still super excited about it. Why? Because of the transformational power that it brings for us to add resiliency to the electric grid and use power grids more efficiently.

Being transformational requires you to do those trade-offs – you can’t achieve a transformational change without them. Transformational change is not easy.

And if I look at the US in most parts of the US grid this application has significant potential.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2xpbmV2aXNpb24tYW5ub3VuY2VzLTMzbS1zZXJpZXMtYy1pbi1ncm93dGgtY2FwaXRhbC10by1hY2NlbGVyYXRlLXRoZS1uZXQtemVyby1ncmlkLTMwMTYzOTY0MC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LineVision Announces $33M Series C in Growth Capital to Accelerate the Net Zero Grid,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2xpbmV2aXNpb24tYW5ub3VuY2VzLTMzbS1zZXJpZXMtYy1pbi1ncm93dGgtY2FwaXRhbC10by1hY2NlbGVyYXRlLXRoZS1uZXQtemVyby1ncmlkLTMwMTYzOTY0MC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC8FD1BA0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2xpbmV2aXNpb24tYW5ub3VuY2VzLTMzbS1zZXJpZXMtYy1pbi1ncm93dGgtY2FwaXRhbC10by1hY2NlbGVyYXRlLXRoZS1uZXQtemVyby1ncmlkLTMwMTYzOTY0MC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3MuaW5xdWlyZXIubmV0LzM2NjEzMi9zYW4tbWlndWVsLXJlYWRpZXMtcmVnaW9ucy1sYXJnZXN0LWJhdHRlcnktZW5lcmd5LXN0b3JhZ2Utc3lzdGVt0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly9idXNpbmVzcy5pbnF1aXJlci5uZXQvMzY2MTMyL3Nhbi1taWd1ZWwtcmVhZGllcy1yZWdpb25zLWxhcmdlc3QtYmF0dGVyeS1lbmVyZ3ktc3RvcmFnZS1zeXN0ZW0vYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,San Miguel readies region’s largest battery energy storage system,"Listed conglomerate San Miguel Corp. is offering battery energy storage system for about P2 to P3 per kilowatt-hour as part of its efforts to increase its portfolio of sustainable power supply solutions its top executive said.

SMC through its power arm SMC Global Power Holdings Corp. (SMCGP) completed in June this year 500 megawatt hours of battery energy storage system (BESS) facilities nationwide which it said was the largest of its kind in Southeast Asia.

SMCGP earmarked more than $1 billion to finance the construction of more than 31 battery energy storage facilities to ensure “reliable power supply nationwide even in far-off areas.”

Ang said SMCGP is yet to secure a license for the 500 MWh battery energy storage.

The SMC subsidiary was targeting increasing the total battery capacity to 700 MWh by year-end and Ang told reporters they expect to scale it up further to 1000 MWh “within the next few months.”

“We hope [to offer battery energy storage] before the peak season” Ang said. Historical data from the government shows that electricity consumption peaks during the summer months from April to May.

Ang earlier expressed confidence in improving power quality and addressing the intermittent nature of renewables with the integration of battery storage into the power grid.

“We believe this and other bridge technologies will allow us to truly achieve a just and inclusive transition to a clean energy future that will not only sustain our economic recovery and growth but will also benefit both our environment and many Filipinos” he added.

(Photo courtesy of Stefanos Nikolaidis)

What do robots manufacturing and stroke rehabilitation have in common? Stefanos Nikolaidis an assistant professor in computer science in the Viterbi School of Engineering has worked on these problems before combining a different side of humanity with robotics.

In July Agilent a life sciences company bringing technologies to laboratories worldwide presented Nikolaidis with the Agilent 2022 Early Career Professor Award for his work in human-robot collaboration in manufacturing. This award comes at a time where the ties between automation manufacturing and the supply chain are more important than ever as a result of the pandemic Agilent said in a press release.

Nikolaidis’ journey in robotics begins far earlier though as a university student in Greece where he studied electrical and computer engineering at the National Technical University of Athens.

“One of my professors there was a robotics professor but he was also in a wheelchair because he had [a] surgery that didn’t go very well” Nikolaidis said. “Therefore he had very limited mobility but he was also doing research in robotics as a way to improve not only his own life … but also to improve other people’s lives that are in a similar situation. I found that very inspiring.”

From there his journey has spanned multiple countries and continents eventually bringing him to Los Angeles where he currently studies how robots can be integrated into a human team — particularly in manufacturing.

“There has been a lot of work in robotics that has focused on how we can make robots more and more autonomous — for example how we can have a drone fly by itself how we can have a car drive by itself” Nikolaidis said.

But Nikolaidis finds the reality of integrating robots into a human team to be very different from the sci-fi horrors of robots taking over the world.

“The robot needs to be able to adapt to the preferences of the human teammates and have a shared mental model with the other teammates to be able to be a productive team member. This is where the core research question in human robot interaction is” Nikolaidis said. “[We are researching] how we can develop algorithms that enable a robot to be productive and efficient but at the same time to act in a way that is acceptable and in a way that is perceived as trustworthy by the human workers.”

This idea of trust has been an integral part of Nikolaidis’ work ever since his time at Carnegie Mellon University under his PhD advisor Siddhartha Srinivasa.

“[Nikolaidis] specifically looked at a couple of aspects of algorithmic human robot interaction. One of them specifically is around trust” Srinivasa said. “What does it mean for the human to trust the robot? I think we all sort of qualitatively know what it means to trust someone but how do you turn that into a mathematical model?”

Nikolaidis’ work is heavily focused on solving real world problems in manufacturing and other industries. When he first arrived in L.A. he visited stroke patients at the Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center to see how he could use robotics to make an impact.

“I asked stroke patients there ‘If you have a robot arm like this — I showed them some videos some slides — what would you like the arm to do?’ People said things like assistive eating — something I worked on in the past — but what really made an impression is that a woman said ‘I really have messy hair and that affects how I feel and my self image. I would really like a robot to help me comb my hair’” Nikolaidis said. “We developed a hair combing system and we have been iterating on that over the years.”

Nikolaidis’ effort in speaking with those impacted stood out in particular to his faculty mentor Maja Matari professor of computer science neuroscience and pediatrics.

“Engineers come up with many ideas about what stroke survivors may need. For example engineers might think ‘Well they need a robot to reach things for them.’ But really those are uninformed guesses. Unless you’re a member of the stroke survivor community you really don’t know what it’s like and what is really needed so you should not presume” Matarić said. “It is really wonderful to see a young researcher like Nikolaidis not presuming but taking the time to learn directly.”

Matarić recognizes the difficulty in these robotics problems and said she resonates strongly with Nikolaidis’ willingness to tackle them.

“Too few researchers in robotics work on truly challenging real-world problems. Instead researchers often find it easier to work on simulations or in toy evaluation domains but Nikolaidis is willing to take on the hard problems such as stroke rehabilitation with real stroke patients” Matarić said.

Since human-robot collaboration is still a relatively new field there are many new outlets to be explored especially the unpredictability of human nature. Srinivasa recognizes the difficulty of managing this mercurialness in fields such as autonomous vehicles.

“The problem is these pesky humans because we drive and do things like one [piece] is our intentions and our cost functions are hidden and latent and very personal. I think the second piece is that we are highly suboptimal agents right? It’s not like we compute Nash equilibria and act accordingly” Srinivasa said.

This challenge of finding a solution and tying together the volatility of human nature and the predictability of robots is what makes the work fulfilling for both researchers. Nikolaidis sees the potential for robots to help out at home tying back to his original inspiration to pursue robotics.

“If we are to introduce robots at home … by definition a human environment where everything is chaotic and there are multiple users then I think this is a very challenging application” Nikolaidis said. “I think this is right now … one of the main goals in human robot interaction which is how we can have a robot at home and be able to assist with everyday tasks and especially how it can help people with different types of disabilities and people with limited mobility.”

Although he is now at the University of Washington Srinivasa said he cherishes the time that Nikolaidis spent with him.

“I find [Nikolaidis] to be fearless and committed to running user studies to studying cognitive psychology papers … to doing everything that is needed to make sure that humans and robots work effectively together. You have to be very selfless and accept the fact that to get a robot to do anything you have to really do everything. I think [Nikolaidis] is one of the best that I’ve worked with when it comes to acknowledging that” Srinivasa said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMi8xMC8wNC8yNTI4MTY1LzAvZW4vVGhlLUdsb2JhbC1CaW9pbmZvcm1hdGljcy1NYXJrZXQtdG8tU3VycGFzcy1VU0QtNDYtQmlsbGlvbi1ieS0yMDI3LURlbHZlSW5zaWdodC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Global Bioinformatics Market to Surpass USD 46 Billion by 2027 | DelveInsight,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMi8xMC8wNC8yNTI4MTY1LzAvZW4vVGhlLUdsb2JhbC1CaW9pbmZvcm1hdGljcy1NYXJrZXQtdG8tU3VycGFzcy1VU0QtNDYtQmlsbGlvbi1ieS0yMDI3LURlbHZlSW5zaWdodC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018ECA0AF9A0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMi8xMC8wNC8yNTI4MTY1LzAvZW4vVGhlLUdsb2JhbC1CaW9pbmZvcm1hdGljcy1NYXJrZXQtdG8tU3VycGFzcy1VU0QtNDYtQmlsbGlvbi1ieS0yMDI3LURlbHZlSW5zaWdodC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,,,,

MEPs approved a revision of rules on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in October 2022.

The new rules will further reduce the amount of dangerous chemicals in waste and production processes by introducing stricter limits removing pollutants from the recycling chain and banning certain chemicals.

Take a look at our video with lead MEP Martin Hojsík (Renew Europe Slovakia) who explains what persistent organic pollutants are why they are dangerous and the changes to the legislation Parliament has pushed for.



What are persistent organic pollutants?



Persistent organic pollutants are toxic chemicals that are slow to break down. When released they stay in the environment for a long time and accumulate in the food chain and living organisms. That’s why they are also sometimes referred to as forever chemicals.





Because of their persistence these chemicals can be transported by water air or migratory species across borders and carried far away from where they were first produced or used. They can also be transferred from one generation to the next even if they are no longer produced or used.

This means that we can find such pollutants virtually everywhere: in our food in the air we breathe in products used in our daily lives such as paint varnish and soap and in waste coming from some consumer products such as waterproof textiles furniture plastics and electronic equipment.



They are also present in pesticides industrial chemicals such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and unintentional by-products of industrial processes such as dioxins.

What are the effects of “forever chemicals”?



Pollutants known as forever chemicals accumulate in waste soil air and water posing a threat to the environment and human health. They are in our immediate environment but also found in the Arctic the Alps and the Baltic Sea which serve as European sinks of pollutants.

High exposures to chemicals have resulted in diseases or abnormalities in a number of wildlife species including certain kinds of fish birds and mammals. They have also been found in humans- including in breast milk - and can increase the risk of cancer reproductive disorders alteration of the immune system neurobehavioural impairment hormone disruption damage to DNA and increased birth defects.

For example exposure to dioxins can result in skin lesions immune system defects and disturbances of the hormone and reproductive systems. In 2008 Ireland found high levels of dioxins in pork in 1999 dioxins were found in poultry and eggs in Belgium and in Italy a chemical accident in a factory released dioxins in 1976.

How to manage waste containing persistent organic pollutants?



As these chemicals take a lot of time to disappear their waste management needs to be carefully regulated so that they do not re-enter the economy after their disposal. This risk needs to be considered when the EU carries out its circular economy plan.

This means products containing persistent chemicals need to be treated in such a way that the pollutants:

are destroyed (for example through incineration)

irreversibly transformed or

permanently stored (for example in deep underground hard rock formations salt mines or a landfill site for hazardous waste).



In some cases when the concentration of harmful chemicals is below a certain threshold the recycling of products could be allowed.

Read more about waste management in Europe.

How is the EU regulating persistent organic pollutants?



As the management of persistent organic pollutants requires international cooperation the EU has joined the Aarhus Protocol (1998) and the Stockholm Convention (2001) which provide international restrictions or bans on production import/export restrictions and provisions on recycling.

The EU regulation on these chemicals implements commitments made under the international agreements concerning production and export. Here is a list of all the persistent organic pollutants regulated by the EU.

In 2021 the European Commission proposed to review the legislation. In October 2022 the European Parliament approved the new rules.



The changes include:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vaG9wdG93bmNocm9uaWNsZS5vcmcvdHJpZ2ctY291bnR5LW1hbi1zaW5ncy1oYXBweS1iaXJ0aGRheS10by1odW5kcmVkcy1lYWNoLXllYXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trigg County man sings 'Happy Birthday' to hundreds each year,"James Bridges has had a knack for singing since he was a little boy. And for decades he’s sung happy birthday wishes to church members and close friends. But then through word of mouth alone more and more people discovered his ability and requested he sing to their loved ones.

“People heard how well I could sing that they got me to sing to their girlfriend and boyfriend and their children and all that stuff” Bridges said. “And it just blew up from there.”

In 2003 news coverage of his work exacerbated this explosion. Now Bridges personally calls and sings happy birthday to no fewer than nine individuals on any given day of the year. He sings to the most people — a whopping 45 — on his own birthday May 1.

Happy Birthday(s)

Bridges cracks open a binder chocked full of birthdays and finds a name with his finger. He taps out the accompanying phone number for his cousin Steve Turner. As soon as Turner picks up Bridges rolls into a resonant rendition of the famous birthday jingle with his personal flair sprinkled into the mix.

“Happy birthday Mr. Turner my cousin” Bridges said. “This is Deacon Dr. Bridges Deacon Dr. James D. Bridges wishing you a very very happy birthday and I will see you later.”

Turner is just one of the nearly 3000 individuals Bridges has called since he started keeping track. Another yearly recipient of Bridges’ warm greetings is Marcia Bryant who worked with him at Air Products and Chemicals in Calvert City for more than three decades.

A Trigg County man brings joy to hundreds of people each year by calling to sing happy birthday. Some he knows; some he’s never met. Listen to the story here.

“I changed companies in 2012 and he’s called me every year since then” Bryant said. “But up until then of course he would just make sure he stepped into your office on your birthday and sang to you in person.”

Bryant says people feel “special” when they receive a call from Bridges.

“You know he cares to make that effort because he knows he’s putting that smile on your face” she said. “As a matter of fact today is my birthday. This morning the first thing my husband said when I got up he said ‘Have you got your call from James yet?’ I said ‘No not today but it’s still early.’ And in about 30 minutes I got that phone call.”

And she knows Bridges feels just as good calling so many people every day.

“I think it makes him feel like he’s doing something to please people to make people happy” Bryant said. “He likes to please people. He appreciates the praise we give him and the thanks we give him for doing it.”

Because Bridges makes a point to call people on their actual date of birth — no matter what day of the week that may be — Bryant says she and others have always wondered how he blocks out the time to do it.

“While he was working he got up he had a long drive from Cadiz area to Calvert City” she said. “And he would call people when he got up in the morning. He would call people on his way to work. It took him several hours a day I’m sure to catch everybody and to leave messages for all the people that he had each day. I guess that occupied his drive to work anyway.”

Humble Beginnings

Bridges has been a member of Corinth Missionary Baptist Church in Cadiz for more than 60 years serving as a deacon for about 10 years now. Before that he was a Sunday school superintendent and a choir member. The latter role was where his penchant for singing shone brightest.

“I sang in a church choir” he said. “And then they knew how well I could sing so I led the songs in the church and all this stuff.”

In May 1978 Bridges received devastating news: He had a brain tumor doctors deemed inoperable because of its sensitive location. This stressful diagnosis nearly sidelined his life — until one uncanny encounter with a cow.

“Basically long story short I hit a cow” he said. “That made [the tumor] move enough for them to operate. And then that’s where this stuttering came from. But I don’t stutter when I sing like Mel Tillis.”

This turn of fortune inspired Bridges to become even more involved in his faith.

“I feel very blessed very blessed” he said. “I didn’t want the government to be taking care of me for the rest of my life so I got up and I started doing my exercising and going through physical therapy and all this stuff. And I got up in 1980 was the time they called me back to work.”

That wouldn’t be the only struggle Bridges would face though. His wife Theresa recently grappled with complications related to a hole in the heart she’s had since birth which doctors anticipated would eventually close up on its own.

“She was climbing up the steps one day and she said ‘James you’re going to take me to the doctor because I don’t feel too good’ Bridges recounted. “So I took her. Then they kept her up there from about three until nine o’clock that night. Then they told her that she would have to be rushed to medical. They had all kinds of needles sticking in her arm or something. I got down on my knees and I prayed that God would take care of her and she’s back with me.”

Bridges said he missed his wife during her month-long tenure in the hospital earlier this year but remained positive in the face of adversity.

As to how he said: “Just thanking my heavenly father for bringing me this far and bringing Theresa this far because she didn’t have to come home with me but the Lord so said to let her come on back home.”

No End in Sight

Since retiring from Air Products and Chemicals on June 3 2019 — after 46 years seven months and 11 days by his calculations — Bridges said he’s had more time to wish more people a happy birthday. Only now so many people wish him well on his birthday that he spends days returning their calls.

“I went through my phone but I haven’t gotten them all yet” he said. “There’s so many people that’s wishing me happy birthday because mine is on the first [of May]. People love you. Since I’m retired now I love it I love it I love it.”

At 68 Bridges still finds joy in every birthday call he makes. He says calls to the elderly are particularly heartfelt.

“So many elderly people that I sing to they just cry. Oh golly” he said. “And then they want to bring up that I cry with them because I’m tenderhearted too. The wife she says that I’m not but I’m tenderhearted. But those elderly people they cry and then I sing happy birthday to them and I just cry.”

Children who Bridges says are treated to the traditional version of the song also bring forth some fun reactions.

“They are shy because they don’t want to pick up the phone” he said. “But as they get older then they’ll listen to me and they’ll say ‘Thank you and thank you and thank you.’”

Due in part to news coverage over the past two decades Bridges gained notoriety “all over the country and in some foreign countries” for his birthday calls a feat not lost on him. He keeps another binder of clippings from various publications that have documented his story including The Cadiz Record and even a Ripley’s Believe It or Not comic strip.

“When I wake up in the morning I thank the Lord for letting me see another day” he said. “And I say ‘I wonder how many birthdays I got to sing today?’ And then I go to the book and I say ‘Oh it’s only 15’ and 18 and stuff like that. Now I can talk longer because I’m not on the job.”

Bridges plans to keep calling people on their birthdays for the foreseeable future. In fact he jotted down my birthday at the end of the interview.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9rcmlzdGVuLXN0ZXdhcnQtanVzdC1icm91Z2h0LWJhY2stMjA1NTA0NzAxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kristen Stewart Just Brought Back the Brunette Mullet & It Looks Cooler Than Ever,"In the last few years Kristen Stewart has worn her hair blonde and medium-length with a bit of a shag. Not since her role as Joan Jett in the 2010 movie The Runaways have we seen the actor with a brunette mullet. But Stewart brought back the cool-girl cut while sitting front row at Chanel’s Paris Fashion Week Spring/Summer 2023 show — a show that was actually inspired by the fashion icon. She’s rocked buzz cuts textured bobs bleach blonde and more but this might be our favorite yet.

Her longtime hairstylist Adir Abergel is responsible for the chop that looks a bit like a grown-out pixie cut in the best way possible. He shared all the angles of her style on Instagram stories so we can see exactly how choppy the cut is. We couldn’t be more obsessed. The Creative Director of Virtue Labs used the brand’s 6-in-1 Styling Paste ($38 at Ulta Beauty) to create that shaggy finished look.

This new cut and beauty look feels the most like Kristen Stewart than we’ve seen in a long time. She has the confidence the facial structure and the swagger to pull off such an edgy chop. When she has a golden blonde bob she looks gorgeous but it just doesn’t feel like her. And that’s not to even mention the long brunette hair she wore during her Twilight days. This is so much cooler.

We have a feeling we’re going to be seeing a lot of shaggy mullets this fall and winter. Chat with your hairstylist to see the best length and style for your face shape and go for it.

Model and entrepreneur Iskra Lawrence saw a blatant hole in the body care category. ""When I walked the body care aisles they felt stale and uninspiring"" Lawrence told Insider. The few products that did excite her were either too expensive not inclusive or inaccessible to the average consumer. To bridge the gap Lawrence created Saltair a skincare brand company that puts products like body wash and lotion on the same pedestal as face wash and moisturizer all at drugstore prices.

Saltair's current offerings include a body wash (available in seven fragrance options) a body lotion (available in five fragrance options) a scrub treatment and a natural deodorant (available in eight fragrances). The individual products retail between $5 and $20 and come sustainably packaged in 100% aluminum bottles and sugar cane-derived tubes. Lawrence warns that some of her brand's bottles might arrive with minor ""dings and dents"" but hopes Saltair customers will embrace these imperfections rather than scrutinize them. ""I call it #BottlePositivity"" Lawrence explained via email. ""Perfection doesn't exist and [we're] saving carbon emissions by not sending out excess product or wasted packaging.""

Though inclusivity affordability and sustainability are the top three pillars of the Saltair brand Lawrence also put an emphasis on the sensory experience of her body care products. In this article we put the body wash body lotion and skincare deodorant to the test to find out if these consciously formulated items are as beneficial to the soul as they are to the skin.

What ingredients are in Saltair's products?

Lawrence told Insider that they prioritized ""exotic"" ingredients that would give the products a ""unique texture effect or fragrance.""

Some of the most commonly found ingredients across Saltair products are niacinamide salicylic acid glycolic acid and retinol. According to Dr. Jeannette Graf a board-certified dermatologist and assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine niacinamide and salicylic acids are helpful in aiding inflammation of the skin removing bacteria clearing acne and brightening the skin. Glycolic is an exfoliating agent that helps rid the skin of dead skin cells while retinol speeds up cell turnover replacing dead skin with new skin to promote a healthier completion Graf adds.

Is Saltair sustainable?

We can't confirm with certainty that the brand itself is 100% sustainable but we do know that Saltair prioritizes sustainability practices. Each item comes packaged in 100% aluminum bottles and sugar cane-derived tubes and deodorant refillable pods are available for purchase in order to minimize the brand's carbon footprint even further. What's more the brand has taken what's called a ""plastic pledge"" promising to reduce its use of single-use plastic and instead use post-consumer recycled plastics wherever and whenever possible.

Saltair has also committed to cleaning our oceans and planting more trees through its various partnerships with Plastic Bank and One Tree Planted. In 2022 the brand's first year of business Saltair intends to recover over 18.2 tons of plastic from our oceans and with the help of its customers trees will continue to be planted all over the world through a donation of some of the brand's proceeds.

Our review of Saltair's Skincare Deodorant

Amir Ismael/Insider

Saltair's 24-Hour Protection Deodorant was easily my favorite product from the collection. I'm very picky when it comes to deodorant but I'm obsessed with this formula's natural ingredient list and I love the fact that there was no uncomfortable (re: damp) detoxification period. I've been applying it every morning and feel fresh until evening and the pleasant scent even holds up after a sweaty run. You also can't beat a refillable product; this sweat-stopping sustainable deodorant is a win in my book.

Our review of Saltair's Body Wash

Sally Kaplan/Insider

I had mixed emotions about Satair's body wash. Formula-wise I really enjoyed it; the gel is light but creates bubbly suds when wet which I love in a body wash. I also often use body wash in lieu of traditional shaving cream and believe the Lush Greens formula's inclusion of soothing Monoi Oil prevented the irritation my sensitive skin normally experiences from razors. In terms of scent however the Lush Greens' earthy fragrance was not for me. The Exotic Pulp AHA Body Lotion however emitted an aroma I absolutely loved. It has notes of orange guava and musk — and smells like a mimosa for your skin.

Our review of Saltair's Body Lotion

Sally Kaplan/Insider

Of the three products tested I'd rank Saltair's lotion number two. I tried the Santal Bloom Body Wash (the brand's bestseller and one of Lawrence's favorite scents in the collection) and loved its light earthy scent (it has notes of magnolia rose and jasmine wrapped in musky sandalwood). It's marketed as a nourishing and brightening formula and I did notice a subtle glow upon application. I didn't find the lotion especially softening which is what I typically look for in a post-shower lotion but between the fragrance and soft illumination I enjoyed massaging it into my arms and decolletage before bed.

Cons to Consider

The one major caveat of Saltair is ironically its use of scents. Fragrance comes down to personal preference so while one might love a certain kind of aroma others might find it off-putting. If you don't already know what types of smells you enjoy in body care products it might take some trial and error.

The bottom line

Saltair body care products offer a ton of bang for your buck. The formulas use high-quality ingredients and the brand's eco-friendly practices make me feel better about using its products. You'll be hard-pressed to find a body care company with this much value at such an affordable price.

Animals are not only traveling on Airbnb but they’re also co-hosting with their human companions.

Wonder-fur pet-friendly stays

More than 3 million pets1 have checked into Airbnb since last November when we launched new protections for Hosts against pet damages under AirCover for Hosts as part of our 2021 Winter Release.

Since the pandemic guests and their pets have found themselves unleashed from the office trotting out to live and work anywhere. And increasingly more listings are allowing pets as guests to help create an unfurrgetable experience.

People and pets have fanned out and traveled for weeks and even months. In fact a quarter of the nights booked2 during the first half of 2022 that included at least one pet was for trips lasting 28 days or more – showing that longer stays with pets are more than pawsible.

Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky joined this trend earlier this year when he and Sophie his one-year-old golden retriever began living anywhere on Airbnb staying in people’s homes in new towns and cities every few weeks while working remotely.

Guests traveling with pets were also more likely to book in rural or less dense urban areas suggesting that maybe they were ready to ruff it in the outdoors3. The US states with the highest shares of nights booked under an Airbnb woof with a pet during the first half of 2022 were:

North Carolina

West Virginia

Oregon

New Mexico

Vermont

Her working farm in Texas has sheep a cow and 11 llamas including a soon-to-be mama llama named Pistol Annie due in the spring. The llamas guard the sheep from predators by offering an alarm cry when they sense a prob-llama.

“To also be able to share these wonderful animals is a bonus” Bonnie says. “Guests leave here knowing their names and get to know the animal’s behaviors and routines. They follow up with us asking about their favorites and how they are doing.”

Bonnie’s farm animals have become legendairy to some of her guests who follow up on social media and come back to see her animals again and again.

“We love being a part of these forever memories that these families will take with them when they leave and look back on as ‘that time we went to that llama farm…’ That’s huge to us. We don’t take those special moments for granted.” – Superhost Bonnie

In May Airbnb introduced a new way to search designed around Airbnb Categories making it even easier for guests to connect with unique stays some of which include animals. With more than 250000 homes4 within Farms Barns and Countryside combined you may find pets and animals of all shapes and sizes who welcome guests to their udderly extraordinary stays.

To that effect here are some of the most wishlisted farmstays worldwide5 which may include all sorts of animals from llamas cows bees goats and more.

How Travelers Choose | The Brink,"Airbnb or Hotel? How Travelers Choose Study finds hygiene is the top decision factor for hotel customers and that Airbnb fans can be easily tempted to swap a home share for room service

Makarand Mody an SHA associate professor of hospitality marketing found that if hotels and Airbnb properties were evenly matched most customers would pick a hotel. Airbnb vs. Hotels Airbnb or Hotel? How Travelers Choose Study finds hygiene is the top decision factor for hotel customers and that Airbnb fans can be easily tempted to swap a home share for room service

Planning a big summer trip back to his native India Makarand Mody faced a common vacation dilemma: Airbnb or hotel? Did he want a space of his own or someone to make the bed? A place with a kitchen or one with a buffet breakfast?

After a pandemic-enforced break from travel and with a toddler in tow he decided to splash out on a hotel.

“My friend was shooting over home sharing options—those were actually beautiful—but I told him ‘This is my one vacation in three years find me a hotel: I just want to unwind I want the service I don’t want to do things myself’” says Mody a Boston University School of Hospitality Administration associate professor of hospitality marketing.

He spent his break at the upscale Hyatt Place Hinjewadi in Pune with its outdoor pool free breakfasts and room service. The hotel proved the right option for that trip—the staff he says “catered to all our needs including the meal preferences of my highly demanding 21-month-old”—but Mody has often made the opposite call opting for the seclusion and independence of a private home.

“I find myself literally for every trip trying to compare the two and see what the better option would be” he says.

In many ways Mody is like every traveler weighing that decision. But he is also an expert on the sharing economy and recently studied how other travelers approach the same question delving into the factors that drive their selection of a traditional hotel or a place from sites like Airbnb and Vrbo online marketplaces that allow homeowners to rent out their properties for short stays.

In a new paper published in the International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management Mody found that there are hotel people and there are Airbnb people—but that nearly everyone bases their final accommodation decisions on the same factors. Ratings and service quality are top influencers for all consumers while amenities like pools aren’t the big swing factors some might assume and most don’t care too much about transportation links and neighborhood safety. His findings may help hotels lure customers from Airbnb—and help home sharing sites better compete with hotels.

“There’s a large amount of consistency in how consumers choose” says Mody who has previously studied the economic impact of Airbnb as well as its influence on how travelers experience a vacation destination. “We were thinking [for] folks who typically use luxury accommodation different things will be important versus somebody who stays in the economy segment—but that was not the case.”

Given the rise of Airbnb—it now has more than six million listings and had revenue of close to $6 billion in 2021—something else surprised Mody and his colleagues. “In general” he says “if you ask an average person all things equal they would tend toward a hotel.”

What Hotel Customers Are Looking For

To begin figuring out how people pick between hotels and Airbnb Mody and his research team came up with five accommodation segments for study participants to select from based on their typical spending: economy midscale upscale upper-upscale and luxury. They also created decision scenarios—similar to how you might zero in on a vacation by clicking through options on a travel site like Expedia—using 21 “choice attributes” that might shape a customer’s final decision like ratings amenities cancellation policies and hygiene. Participants could decide between different hotels and Airbnb properties—or could plump for nothing at all.

Other researchers have studied how consumers make their vacation stay decisions but Mody says they’ve largely relied on self-reported surveys rather than trying to re-create the booking experience.

“None were perhaps realistic enough to capture how consumers actually think” says Mody who will be leading the SHA Research Conference 2022 A Critical Reflection on the Future of Hospitality later this month. “Our methodology—choice-based conjoint—was unique; it tries to mimic how you would actually make a decision. It puts the same sort of variables and parameters in front of you just like you were in an actual choice situation. And based on the choices you make we’re able to figure out what’s important to you as a consumer.”

The research team—which also included Sean Jung an SHA assistant professor of hospitality analytics—found two sets of customers tended to prefer hotels: those shopping at the top and bottom ends of the market. The big spenders wanted to live in luxury Mody speculates to have their every need met by someone else. Those shopping on a tight budget they just wanted a clean bed.

“If I’m paying $75 a night I don’t know if I want to stay in someone’s house because I don’t really know what I’m getting versus a hotel” says Mody.

But the biggest clump of customers landed in the middle: they were shopping in the mid- to upper-scale and tended to be more open to a house share. Mody calls them the Airbnb group.

“If I’m paying $150 a night I’m more likely to compare a little bit more closely to see what I’m getting between a hotel and an Airbnb” says Mody. “Am I getting that fabulous service that might perhaps move me toward a hotel or am I getting this Airbnb with a beautiful ocean view?”

Unsurprisingly given that the research was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic hygiene was a big factor in most customers’ final decisions. But the researchers found it was especially important for those who tended to prefer hotels. It was the top consideration for people who landed in both the economy and luxury categories.

“Whether they ended up choosing an Airbnb or a hotel” says Mody “consumers who typically choose hotels valued that hygiene-related information—an accommodation company saying ‘Hey we’re taking care of your hygiene and sanitation needs travel stress-free’—significantly more than did the Airbnb group.”

The rest of the choice attributes were clustered in three tiers of influence a pattern that held whatever a customer’s budget or final accommodation preference. In the top tier were guest ratings level of service and host description (were they fun and friendly or professional?); the second tier had parking pool Wi-Fi breakfast kitchen and price presentation (did they have an all-in price or a breakdown?). Down at the bottom for everyone were cancellation policy neighborhood safety safety equipment and transportation.

“On the top of the pyramid were quality factors” says Mody. “It wasn’t that all of the quality-related factors were more important to hotel consumers versus say all of the amenities were important to Airbnb consumers. It didn’t work out that cleanly.”

What Airbnb and Hotels Can Learn from Each Other

For the hotel industry—which Mody previously found had lost millions in revenue up to $365 million in New York City alone thanks to Airbnb—there’s lots of good news from the research. The first is that even customers who are inclined to book through Airbnb would switch to a hotel if the key choice attributes matched up.

“There’s something to do with the assurance of staying in a hotel” says Mody. “You know it’s a professional accommodation provider they take care of you provide service versus an Airbnb where there’s really nothing and nobody taking care of you.”

Talk up your quality and service: Professional customer service can be a unique selling point over home share properties with distant owners. 2. Promote hygiene: Hotel customers at both ends of the market care about cleanliness and stress-free travel. 3. Match Airbnb’s unique selling points: Adjoining rooms suites kitchenettes—mirroring some of the amenities found in private homes could help sway customers away from home shares. Close

If you run a hotel says Mody and you can duplicate some of the unique selling points of Airbnb—and push that additional level of customer service—you might get a competitive advantage. He’s seen hotels building rooms or suites of rooms that can accommodate larger groups or adding kitchenettes to each floor in an effort to better mirror private homes. And he adds price is less of a factor than it used to be. When Airbnb was the new kid on the block its average rates were significantly cheaper than those of hotels. Now with more professional hosts pandemic-related price increases and new taxes and fees they’ve crept up: the average daily Airbnb rate has reportedly jumped 37 percent in the past three years.

On the flip side just as hotels are stealing a few tricks from Airbnb home-sharing sites are learning from more established accommodation providers. Airbnb now provides training for hosts and encourages them to add professional-level customer service flourishes such as welcoming new guests in person. “Little touches that make you feel welcome” says Mody “just like you do in a hotel.” He’s also found some of its technological upgrades—adding “Superhost” badges to properties with ratings over 4.8 stars for example—can have a big impact something reinforced by the high importance attached to quality in his latest study.

Airbnb Owners: How to Compete with Hotels Advice for Airbnb property owners from Makarand Mody’s latest hospitality industry research Read More 1. Add a personal touch: Welcoming new guests in person or leaving a basket of goodies can help customers feel like they’re in good hands. 2. Promote hygiene: Folks who typically book hotels care about cleanliness—they want a stress-free stay—so let them know what you’re doing to keep them safe. 3. Aim for Superhost status: Quality counts so take advantage of Airbnb’s tech innovations like the Superhost badge—it’s a small addition to your listing that could have an outsize impact. Close

“Those are the sort of technological tweaks that are actually very visible to a customer that add value. It’s all very subliminal: it doesn’t seem much on the face of it adding a Superhost badge but it’s amazing how our brains work and attribute so much more trust to that” says Mody. “The tech innovations are easy to scale; it’s the human element of hospitality that’s harder to scale across millions of listings.”

And he adds there’s a risk the professionalization of Airbnb may take it further away from its roots: “Everything is more standardized more cookie-cutter—and that’s everything that Airbnb was not supposed to be.”

Airbnb beyond the United States

One factor Mody would like to investigate more is how the purpose of a trip might influence the decision to go with a hotel or an Airbnb property. The latest study presented participants with a fictional three-day vacation to New York City but what if they were traveling for business or with kids or multiple families maybe for a break out of the city? And just as with his trip to India what if it was a special vacation or how about the third visit in one year? He’s also interested in examining Airbnb’s presence beyond Western countries: how are customers in China and India picking a place to stay?

“In 15 years Airbnb has evolved to the point where it feels like it’s a 100-year-old company” says Mody. “But there’s so much research still to be done.”

Hurricane Ian decimated parts of Florida last week with estimated damage costs of up to $47 billion.

Airbnb's refund policy excludes Florida hurricanes because they are ""common enough to be foreseeable.""

As a result guests whose stays were canceled by the storm are not guaranteed refunds.

Airbnb guests and hosts who canceled bookings last week due to Hurricane Ian may have been surprised to learn that the historic storm was not covered by the app's weather-related refund policy.

That's because the vacation rental platform's ""extenuating circumstance policy"" — which automatically refunds guests and waives cancellation fees for hosts during unforeseeable events — specifically excludes Florida hurricanes.

It's one of dozens of weather events natural conditions and diseases that Airbnb considers ""common enough to be foreseeable in that location"" including tropical storms cyclones hurricanes typhoons winter storms and endemic diseases in various regions around the world. Similar guidelines are also enforced by competing Vrbo.

Florida consistently ranks as one of the most popular destinations on the Airbnb app. According to industry data site AirDNA there are approximately 4230 active short term rentals on Fort Myers Beach and Sanibel Island two of the areas hit hardest by Hurricane Ian.

If guests canceled their stay because of the storm Airbnb did not automatically refund the booking. Instead individual hosts must personally decide whether or not to issue full refunds according to their listing's normal cancellation policy Bloomberg reported last week.

One host who rented out his Tampa home on Airbnb during the storm told the outlet that despite the city being under an evacuation order his guest was only entitled to a partial refund. However he personally told the guest that if they initiated the cancellation on their end he would grant them a full refund.

According to Airbnb's host cancellation policy if hosts cancel bookings on their end they can be charged a fee between $50 and $1000. However an Airbnb spokesperson confirmed with Insider that the company made an exception during Hurricane Ian and allowed hosts in Florida to cancel without penalty.

Guests who are looking for more flexible cancellation policies can use Airbnb's search filter for those listings the spokesperson added.

One host new to Airbnb whose property lost power during the storm took to Reddit Sunday to ask advice on whether or not they should issues their guests a full refund.

""Our guests are understandably upset about the situation and we are leaning towards offering refunds for their stays"" the user wrote. ""We're worried that if we don't refund them one bad review/high cancellation rate could really sink our ship. We called Airbnb but the wait is one hour and we're awaiting a callback.""

But not all hosts have been as willing to issue full refunds. One guest who booked an Airbnb on Sanibel Island in two weeks said their host will not cancel the booking or issue a refund.

""My host won't cancel the trip and will not be issuing refunds. Under Airbnb's extenuating circumstances policy they specifically call out that they do not cover hurricanes during Florida's hurricane season"" the guest wrote on Reddit. ""Is there anything that can be done? I'd like to get my money back somehow.""







The post received over 200 responses several of which are from guests in similar situations.

The predicament highlights what AirCover the free travel protection included in every Airbnb stay does and does not cover. While the program is advertised by Airbnb as the ""most comprehensive protection in travel"" the company notes that it is not in fact travel insurance.

""AirCover is not travel insurance. You can always purchase travel insurance from a third party carrier for additional coverage during your trip"" the company says."

Two Italian security researchers have netted more than $46000 in bounties for the discovery of an Akamai misconfiguration despite receiving nothing from Akamai itself.

Akamai is one of the most widely used content delivery networks (CDNs) in the world used by more than a thousand companies including Apple Microsoft Airbnb and the US Department of Defense.

While hunting for bugs in a website using Akamai via bug bounty platform Whitejar researchers Jacopo Tediosi and Francesco Mariani discovered a misconfiguration that allowed them to poison the cache with arbitrary content.

Read more of the latest bug bounty research

The vulnerability is a combination of common HTTP smuggling and hop-by-hop headers abuse techniques the researchers said.

Special headers named ‘hop-by-hop’ are removed from proxies before forwarding requests to the next proxy or the destination.

However specifying the Content-Length header as ‘hop-by-hop’ led Akamai Edge Nodes to remove it. This caused a desynchronization with subsequent nodes which interpreted part of the HTTP request as a separate second new request.

This second response was queued and was subsequently sent in response to requests from other clients or users causing a HTTP smuggling vulnerability.

“An attacker could have inserted malicious arbitrary content into any domain served by the Akamai network affecting their major customers such as the US Department of Defense PayPal Airbnb Mastercard PlayStation Microsoft Apple etc” Tediosi told The Daily Swig.

“This means that they could alter the appearance and behaviour of those websites as they wish. They could also make users’ browsers perform unintended actions on the original sites as if the users were doing them.”

Fixes available

The company has since fixed the issue by preventing the specification of the Content-Length keyword within the Connection header value although an advisory has not yet been published.

Tediosi and Mariani contacted Akamai on March 24 and arranged to coordinate disclosure with a silent fix deployed on April 2. Unfortunately they were told at the start of the process that the company doesn’t offer bug bounties or other rewards.

However while Akamai was working on the patch the pair decided to try and pursue bounties from some of the company’s customers.

“It was the only way to get our work rewarded as Akamai didn’t have a bug bounty program. I honestly didn’t want to use this solution but it worked anyway and allowed us to stay ethical” says Tediosi.

“It worries me a little that difficulties like these may tempt researchers not to report vulnerabilities they find leaving security holes around the web or even worse selling them in black markets.”

The pair immediately received $5000 from Whitejar for the original research. And while a number of bug bounty platforms and organizations – including Bugcrowd Microsoft and Apple – were unable to replicate the vulnerability others were happy to pay up.

The bounties included $25200 from PayPal $14875 from Airbnb $4000 from Hyatt Hotels $750 from Valve $450 from Zomato and $100 from Goldman Sachs.

Tediosi says he believes that the use of hop-by-hop headers for smuggling may affect other implementations besides Akamai and deserves further research. In addition he suggests it may be possible to bypass Akamai’s fix.





RECOMMENDED Browser-powered desync: A new class of HTTP request smuggling attacks",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0YWNrLnRlY2hub2xvZ3kvYWthbWFpLXZ1bG5lcmFiaWxpdHktc2VydmVyLXNpZGUtY2FjaGUtcG9pc29uaW5nLWh0dHAtaGVhZGVyLWZ1bi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Akamai vulnerability could have let hackers attack millions of sites,"A bug in how Akamai – a Content Distribution Network (CDN) and cybersecurity firm – handles HTTP headers could have allowed an attacker to launch a range of potentially devastating attacks including placing malicious code on millions of the world’s websites which rely on the service provider according to security researchers.

Yet when they reported the Akamai vulnerability – promptly checked replicated and acknowledged by the firm which has since quietly mitigated it – they were told that the company doesn’t have a bug bounty programme.

So in a “race against time” Jacopo Tediosi and Francesco Mariani set out to report the vulnerability to exposed Akamai customers who might have been at risk before it was patched including Airbnb Goldman Sachs Hyatt Hotels PayPal Playstation and Starbucks in the hope of securing some reward for their White Hat work.

Their caustic write-up on the process makes for eye-opening and sometimes amusing reading including for the vast divergence in responses to their discloses: PayPal parting with $25200 Airbnb paying $14875 Goldman Sachs a meagre $100 Starbucks saying it wasn’t a major security issue and Playstation being unable to replicate the attack. Others closed tickets with no response or said the report replicated previous disclosures.

Cuttingly they noted: “On Bugcrowd [another bug bounty platform] they were not competent enough to understand the vulnerability and closed both our reports for Tesla.com as “duplicated” (of a ticket clearly not related to ours) and for LastPass.com as “not applicable” because they were unable to reproduce”.

Akamai vulnerability: HTTP headers again...

The two were working on a private Bug Bounty program organised by White Hat platform Whitejar to search for bugs on a website that was using the widely used Akamai CDN. In the process they identified a HTTP Smuggling Vulnerability with significant potential impact. The bug was in how Akamai proxies handled so-called “hop-by-hop” headers – HTTP headers that are meaningful only for a single transport-level connection and which typically must not be retransmitted by proxies or cached or risk being abused by enterprising hackers.

As Jacopo Tediosi put it in a technical report published on Medium on September 29 2022: “‘Smuggled’ responses were being server-side cached from Akamai Edge Nodes for the entire geographic area close to the IP sending the malicious request. This allowed us to semi-permanently (depending on cache times) create new arbitrary contents within almost any domain served by Akamai resulting in a HUGE impact!”

(Sergey Belov Application Security Lead at Acronis notes to The Stack this kind of server-side cache poisoning would let hackers “place malicious content by [on] any URL. Which means they can post fake news or place a malicious JavaScript code that will attack users of this website (stealing accounts money etc.)”

Akamai fixed the issue by applying new rules to header values but as the two noted “we are not sure that there are no bypasses or some other unexpected similar ways to split the requests” – sharing a response from Akamai that notes frankly that a deeper fix wil require “major changes to our… HTTP processing logic.”

Akamai's note to the security researchers suggests structural issues at all CDNs may linger...

Despite the absence of a bounty Akamai responded swiftly to the security researchers’ initial disclosure on March 23 confirming the vulnerability within 25 hours and pushing a silent fix out on April 2.

Whilst public bug bounties are increasingly common not everybody buys into the need for them and many large software providers also do not have them; VMware being one case in point. (As The Stack noted earlier this year “Find a critical pre-authentication exploit that lets you attack VMware’s vCentre Server and you could earn $100000 selling it to a zero day broker like Zerodium. Do the right thing as a security researcher and report it to the software giant and you will get a big fat nothing other than the warm fuzzy glow of being a good person — because the $11 billion (by 2021 revenues) company does not run a paid bug bounty programme.”)

Key Akamai rival Cloudflare meanwhile only launched a paying public bug bounty programme via HackerOne at the start of 2022 noting that its earlier internal disclosure programme had resulted in a “tremendous amount of time to triaging false positive reports and helping the researchers understand their errors”.

That was due to challenges for many in “understanding where Cloudflare fits into the HTTP request/response pipeline” Cloudflare wrote in part because the company did not “provide much supporting documentation about how our products worked…” resulting in a situation in which of 1197 reports disclosures only 158 were valid. (The company has an interesting blog about how it turned around the signal to noise ration here.)

Acronis’ Belov meanwhile notes to us that “this type of HTTP smuggling request is still common if the company is big and has a lot of users that should be balanced or a system that requires specific logic on the backend side. Also companies are starting to use not only a single web servers and application server behind but several web servers. And since the HTTP protocol that we use in WebApps isn't strict enough such issues are happening and will continue to happen… Vendors should try to use the same webservers for balancing and not implement some custom HTTP. They should try to simplify their infrastructure as much as they can...""

Akamai had not responded to a request for comment as we published.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzY29tcHV0ZXIuaW4vY2xvdWQvaW4tYS1wcmljZS1zZW5zaXRpdmUtbWFya2V0LWxpa2UtaW5kaWEtYWZmb3JkYWJpbGl0eS1oYXMtYWx3YXlzLWRpZmZlcmVudGlhdGVkLXVzLWJsYWlyLWx5b24taGVhZC1vZi1jbG91ZC1leHBlcmllbmNlLWFrYW1haS85MDcwNy_SAawBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXhwcmVzc2NvbXB1dGVyLmluL2FtcC9jbG91ZC9pbi1hLXByaWNlLXNlbnNpdGl2ZS1tYXJrZXQtbGlrZS1pbmRpYS1hZmZvcmRhYmlsaXR5LWhhcy1hbHdheXMtZGlmZmVyZW50aWF0ZWQtdXMtYmxhaXItbHlvbi1oZWFkLW9mLWNsb3VkLWV4cGVyaWVuY2UtYWthbWFpLzkwNzA3Lw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In a price-sensitive market like India affordability has always differentiated us: Blair Lyon Head of Cloud Experience Akamai,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzY29tcHV0ZXIuaW4vY2xvdWQvaW4tYS1wcmljZS1zZW5zaXRpdmUtbWFya2V0LWxpa2UtaW5kaWEtYWZmb3JkYWJpbGl0eS1oYXMtYWx3YXlzLWRpZmZlcmVudGlhdGVkLXVzLWJsYWlyLWx5b24taGVhZC1vZi1jbG91ZC1leHBlcmllbmNlLWFrYW1haS85MDcwNy_SAawBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXhwcmVzc2NvbXB1dGVyLmluL2FtcC9jbG91ZC9pbi1hLXByaWNlLXNlbnNpdGl2ZS1tYXJrZXQtbGlrZS1pbmRpYS1hZmZvcmRhYmlsaXR5LWhhcy1hbHdheXMtZGlmZmVyZW50aWF0ZWQtdXMtYmxhaXItbHlvbi1oZWFkLW9mLWNsb3VkLWV4cGVyaWVuY2UtYWthbWFpLzkwNzA3Lw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018ECA918670>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzY29tcHV0ZXIuaW4vY2xvdWQvaW4tYS1wcmljZS1zZW5zaXRpdmUtbWFya2V0LWxpa2UtaW5kaWEtYWZmb3JkYWJpbGl0eS1oYXMtYWx3YXlzLWRpZmZlcmVudGlhdGVkLXVzLWJsYWlyLWx5b24taGVhZC1vZi1jbG91ZC1leHBlcmllbmNlLWFrYW1haS85MDcwNy_SAawBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXhwcmVzc2NvbXB1dGVyLmluL2FtcC9jbG91ZC9pbi1hLXByaWNlLXNlbnNpdGl2ZS1tYXJrZXQtbGlrZS1pbmRpYS1hZmZvcmRhYmlsaXR5LWhhcy1hbHdheXMtZGlmZmVyZW50aWF0ZWQtdXMtYmxhaXItbHlvbi1oZWFkLW9mLWNsb3VkLWV4cGVyaWVuY2UtYWthbWFpLzkwNzA3Lw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtob24yLmNvbS9saXZpbmctODA4L2xpdmluZy1ha2FtYWktZGl2b3JjZS1hbmQtcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUv0gFLaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua2hvbjIuY29tL2xpdmluZy04MDgvbGl2aW5nLWFrYW1haS1kaXZvcmNlLWFuZC1yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Living Akamai: Divorce and Real Estate,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.khon2.com/living-808/living-akamai-divorce-and-real-estate/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtob24yLmNvbS9saXZpbmctODA4L2xpdmluZy1ha2FtYWktZGl2b3JjZS1hbmQtcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUv0gFLaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua2hvbjIuY29tL2xpdmluZy04MDgvbGl2aW5nLWFrYW1haS1kaXZvcmNlLWFuZC1yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vdmlldG5hbW5ldC52bi9lbi9wcm9maXRzLWZyb20tYWR2ZXJ0aXNpbmctZmxvdy1pbnRvLXBvY2tldHMtb2YtZm9yZWlnbi1vdHQtY29tcGFuaWVzLTIwNjYxNjkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Profits from advertising flow into pockets of foreign OTT companies,

If you want to see more stocks in this selection check out 5 American Stocks That Will Benefit from the New Cold War.

A March 2022 survey indicated that more than 6 in 10 American adults believe that the chance of a Cold War is now greater than it was five years ago. However President Biden announced in a United Nations meeting on September 21 that “we do not seek a Cold War” and that the US was not asking “any nation to choose between the United States or any other partner.” However foreign policy experts largely believe that with the US on one side and Russia and China as its opponents a Cold War is already happening.

The United States’ lead in productivity technology and average company size means its economy is still stronger than China’s which is the largest manufacturing and exporting entity in the world but the gap between the two superpowers is far less than was the case between the US and the U.S.S.R. in the old Cold War. If sanctions or trade wars become obvious between the United States and China there are many American stocks that stand to benefit from this scenario. Some of the companies that will be clear winners amid the new Cold War include Fortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT) Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) and Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT).

Our Methodology

We selected American companies operating in the cybersecurity defense and military lithium and precious metals sectors. During geopolitical unrest cyber safety and military firms experience higher demand. Similarly China is the largest lithium and precious metals exporter and a war means the United States and its allies might cut reliance on the country which will boost domestic firms working in the sector.

Like Fortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT) Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) and Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) Qualys Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) is one of the American stocks that will benefit from the new Cold War.

Here is what Headwaters Capital specifically said about Qualys Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:

“Qualys Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) was founded in 1999 and provides vulnerability management software to both SMBs and enterprise customers. Vulnerability management software provides a continuous view of security and compliance across all of a company’s assets including on-premise end-points cloud and mobile. The easiest way to think about QLYS’s original VM solution is that it provided a dashboard that monitored all potential threats to a network and helped IT departments prioritize which vulnerabilities were the highest risk. QLYS was a pioneer in the industry as they were one of the first companies to offer a cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) solution as opposed to the traditional license offerings that proliferated at the time. While QLYS’ VM software has always provided an industry leading dashboard to monitor weaknesses it provided limited functionality to respond to these vulnerabilities. More recently QLYS has increased the functionality of its software through the rollout of Detection and Response capabilities (VMDR) and extended detection and response (XDR) capabilities in late 2021. The cybersecurity space has been marked by a preference of customers for point solution expertise as opposed to a winner take all solution. This market structure is driven by the complex nature of assets that need protection the dynamic nature of security threats and the critical nature of cybersecurity which leads to a customer preference for quality over cost. Historically cybersecurity was best served by firewalls which provided a ring fence around assets that were physically located on a network. Firewalls are increasingly becoming obsolete in the cybersecurity world as the network perimeter has effectively disappeared due to the growing adoption of SaaS solutions and new connected devices that connect to the network from multiple new endpoints. This trend has only accelerated following COVID. As more devices and software tools connect from outside of the traditional firewall perimeter the importance of security monitoring tools such as VM VMDR and XDR has increased. In many ways vulnerability management is the foundation of cybersecurity as it provides the dashboard for monitoring all potential security gaps. QLYS’ software can provide critical data about which assets are exposed to specific threats and can increasingly help IT departments prioritize and remediate these vulnerabilities. Understanding QLYS’s history is important to gaining confidence in QLYS’ ability to maintain revenue growth going forward. QLYS was almost perfectly positioned earlier this decade to take advantage of both the transition in the software market from license to SaaS solutions as well as the cybersecurity trend away from firewalls as devices increasingly moved beyond a physical perimeter. Given the large TAM industry tailwinds and a market leading product QLYS was able to growth revenues at a +20% CAGR from 2012-2018. Even more impressive QLYS was able to accomplish this growth with limited investment in R&D or its sales force. R&D as a percentage of revenues declined from 22% in 2012 to 16% in 2018 while S&M declined from 40% in 2012 to 22% in 2018. Consequently QLYS operates with one of the highest EBITDA margins in the industry at 45%. The ability for QLYS to post such consistent revenue growth despite under-investing in product development and sales is evidence of the strong competitive positioning of QLYS’ software and the critical nature of the product…” (Click here to read more)

Or follow us on Google News

The best selling automobile in Switzerland is now the Tesla Model Y. That’s not just electric cars and it’s not just one month — it’s for the first 9 months of 2022. Furthermore the Model Y’s older but somewhat smaller sibling the Model 3 is the third best selling automobile in the Playground of Europe.

Showing just how much Tesla stands alone in this market no other electric vehicle is in the top 20 (unfortunately). The third best selling electric vehicle in the country the Škoda Enyaq comes in at #22 in the overall auto sales list. It had just barely more than half of the sales of the Model Y in the first 9 months of the year.

Škoda is apparently a popular brand in Switzerland. It is the parent company of the model that splits the Tesla Model Y and Model 3 on the podium with the Škoda Octavia taking second place.

With just two very popular models Tesla hasn’t risen to the top of the brand rankings. German automakers still dominate that view with Volkswagen (10.4%) Mercedes-Benz (8.7%) BMW (8.6%) and Audi (7.8%) in the top 4 positions. And then you’ve got aforementioned Škoda (7.6%). Tesla is down in 8th place (3.9%) having risen just barely ahead of Ford (also 3.9%).

Notably Tesla’s sales in Switzerland in the first 9 months of 2022 were up 52.1%.

If you look only at fully electric vehicles you can see that aside from Tesla’s top two models and the Škoda Enyaq decently performing electric models included the Audi Q4 e-tron the Fiat 500e the Cupra Born the Hyundai IONIQ 5 Volkswagen’s ID.4 and ID.3 and the Audi e-tron.

Overall full electric vehicles accounted for 16.3% of auto sales in Switzerland in the first 9 months of the year and plugin hybrids accounted for another 8.4% coming to 24.7% of auto sales in total for plugin vehicles.

“For the sake of our communities and planet we must do everything in our power to create a clean renewable electric grid by 2030” the Sierra’s Club’s “Dirty Truth” report says. “Utilities must lead this transition but our research shows they are wholly unprepared to do their part. Clean energy is reliable and affordable; electric utilities have no excuse to delay and no time left to waste.”

The report released Monday is an update of a 2021 study the group did. The Sierra Club analyzed plans of 77 utilities that collectively supply about 40% of U.S. electric generation and gave out letter grades based on how well utilities many with their own clean energy goals were working to decarbonize.

“Most are still not on the path to achieve 80% clean electricity by 2030. Of the 77 utilities we studied nearly half of them (44%) made no progress or received a lower score than in our previous report” the Sierra Club said. “This disappointing inaction occurred despite a tumultuous 18 months of grid reliability crises blackouts energy price spikes and extreme weather events; many of these trace their roots in large part to utilities’ stubborn reliance on expensive and unreliable fossil fuels.”

To determine the grades the Sierra Club looked at the latest versions of the utilities’ integrated resource plans documents that lay out how they will meet future electric demand evaluating how quickly they intend to retire coal plants and penalizing them for plans that include building new gas generation.

“If a company includes multiple scenarios in their IRP we use the scenario they denote as their preferred scenario” said Cara Bottorff a Sierra Club managing senior analyst. “If they do not denote a preferred scenario we use the scenario that is the worst case for gas (i.e. the one that would add the most gas) to demonstrate the largest amount of gas that the company is considering building.”

Overall 56% of the utilities examined improved their scores 9% made no progress and 35% got worse grades. You can check how your local utility did here.

The Edison Electric Institute an association that represents investor-owned utilities called the metrics “arbitrary” and dismissed the report as a “messaging document.”

“The reality is that existing nuclear generation and the flexibility provided by natural gas generation are what enabled the U.S. electric power industry to deploy 27 gigawatts of new renewables reliably and cost-effectively last year” said Brian Reil an EEI spokesman.

“The emissions reductions goals set by America’s investor-owned electric companies are firmly grounded in our current understanding of technology and economics and they also reflect our responsibility to prioritize customer affordability and reliability.”

Reil noted that more than 40% of U.S. electricity is now generated by carbon-free resources and said electric utilities are investing in new technologies to deliver more.

“If the Sierra Club truly wants to accelerate the deployment of clean energy they should consider joining the other environmental industry and government leaders who are working together constructively to identify ways to overcome the barriers to building the transmission and other clean energy infrastructure we clearly need in order to deliver more resilient clean energy to customers” he said.

At the Experience POWER conference for energy industry professionals Tuesday in Denver the pace of the renewable energy transition was a major theme. Duane Highley the CEO of Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association — a not-for-profit cooperative supplier which operates in New Mexico Colorado Wyoming and Nebraska and includes 42 electric distribution cooperatives and public power districts that provide power to more than a million consumers — used an old George Carlin comedy bit about driving to illustrate the competing tensions on utilities and electric co-ops trying to decarbonize without risking reliability.

Anybody driving slower than you is an idiot Carlin said while anybody going faster is a maniac.

“We’re being pulled between those people who think we are going too fast and those who think we are going too slow” he said noting that two states his coop operates in New Mexico and Colorado are much more green-energy oriented than the other two: Nebraska and Wyoming.

“There’s no map for this” he said. “We’re in uncharted territory.”

He said the ability to generate electricity from fuel oil helped bail out Tri-State during the 2021 winter storm that caused the grid to collapse in Texas resulting in an estimated 246 deaths. That makes it hard for utilities to ditch the reliability benefits of certain kinds of fossil fuel generation as quickly as some would like.

“We can make this happen and it is happening” Highley said. He added that Tri-State which got a B grade on the Sierra Club report is on pace to have 50% of the electricity used by its members come from renewable sources by 2024 thanks to bountiful wind and solar resources with an eventual goal of getting to 80% decarbonization though that will still require some fossil fuel generation to stay in the mix.

“We’re going to clean up the grid and then we’re going to electrify everything” he said.

Wisconsin utilities push back against low scores

Wisconsin’s three largest electric power utilities all rated poorly in the Sierra report. Company representatives pushed back at the findings.

The Sierra Club gave Wisconsin Public Service an F singling out the Green Bay power company for making no progress toward retiring coal-fired power. The report also rated WPS down for its plans to add 66 megawatts of gas-powered generating capacity by 2030 instead of moving toward the elimination of gas as a fuel by then. WPS is 8% of the way toward a goal of replacing existing fossil-fueled generation entirely with clean energy according to the report.

We Energies received a D in the report. The Milwaukee-based utility is 41% of the way toward retiring all coal-fired power by 2030 and 11% of the way to replacing fossil fuel generation with clean energy according to the Sierra Club.

“We strongly disagree with this report that not only ignores the facts but also discounts the importance of the ongoing investments we are making in renewables and keeping the lights on for customers” said Brendan Conway spokesman for We Energies and WPS both part of WEC Energy Group.

Conway said the utilities should be credited for building Wisconsin’s first large-scale solar parks and operating the largest fleet of wind farms in the state. He called the stated intent at WEC Energies to spend $3.5 billion on new renewable energy generation by 2026 and stop using coal by 2035 “some of the most aggressive environmental goals in the industry.”

A Sierra Club press release that said WEC Energy Group had made “no progress” on its clean energy goals in the last year was “factually wrong” in light of new solar projects and groundbreaking on a new solar/battery park and a new wind park he added.

Alliant Energy which operates as Wisconsin Power & Light in Wisconsin was also given a D grade. The report notes that WPL doesn’t plan to add any new gas generation by 2030 — a positive — and that it is 42% of the way toward retiring all coal-burning power generation by then. The utility is 16% of the way toward a goal of 100% clean-energy generation by then.

Responding to the report Alliant spokeswoman Cindy Tomlinson said the utility is in the process of building 12 solar projects in Wisconsin generating a total of 1100 megawatts with two of them now in service two more scheduled to come online before 2023 and the rest scheduled to be operational by the end of 2023.

While the company has delayed its timeline for retiring coal-fired generation in search of greater flexibility in managing its power capacity and to address supply chain problems Tomlinson said Alliant is still on track to complete that process by mid-2026.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qc29ubGluZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbGlmZS9mb29kL2Zvcmstc3Bvb24tbGlmZS8yMDIyLzEwLzA1L3BhZ2Vscy1wb25kZXJvc2EtY2hlZXNlbWFrZXItbG92ZXMtY2hhbGxlbmdlLXdpbnMtd29ybGQtZGFpcnktZXhwby1hd2FyZHMta2V3YXVuZWUtbW96emFyZWxsYS1tYXN0ZXIvODEyNzc1MjAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pagel's Ponderosa cheesemaker loves the challenge wins world awards,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMitAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qc29ubGluZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbGlmZS9mb29kL2Zvcmstc3Bvb24tbGlmZS8yMDIyLzEwLzA1L3BhZ2Vscy1wb25kZXJvc2EtY2hlZXNlbWFrZXItbG92ZXMtY2hhbGxlbmdlLXdpbnMtd29ybGQtZGFpcnktZXhwby1hd2FyZHMta2V3YXVuZWUtbW96emFyZWxsYS1tYXN0ZXIvODEyNzc1MjAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC9247C10>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qc29ubGluZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbGlmZS9mb29kL2Zvcmstc3Bvb24tbGlmZS8yMDIyLzEwLzA1L3BhZ2Vscy1wb25kZXJvc2EtY2hlZXNlbWFrZXItbG92ZXMtY2hhbGxlbmdlLXdpbnMtd29ybGQtZGFpcnktZXhwby1hd2FyZHMta2V3YXVuZWUtbW96emFyZWxsYS1tYXN0ZXIvODEyNzc1MjAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL21hZGlzb24uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvYnVzaW5lc3Mvd2lsbC13b3JsZC1kYWlyeS1leHBvLXJlbWFpbi1pbi1tYWRpc29uL2FydGljbGVfNWNkZDMzNmEtMjliMi01MjhmLTljYzEtYjVjNzNiZDUzOWUyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will World Dairy Expo remain in Madison?,"The cows have returned for their showers grooming leisurely walks and time in the spotlight on the bark-covered show floor in the Dane County Coliseum.

But there is a lingering question here among the tents pavilions piles of bedding straw and advertisements for genetics and mastitis prevention: Will World Dairy Expo find a new home or will it continue to be a part of the landscape here once its contract with the county expires after the 2023 show?

It appears both the county and the Expo would prefer the status quo but each has concerns.

The county wants to make sure the grounds are suitable for a wide range of uses and events and has considered adding housing hotels and restaurants as a way to increase revenue and further diversify the property. Expo leadership which is about to undertake a strategic planning initiative worries about access under the redevelopment plan the future of conventions and trade shows and how they are evolving post-pandemic as the event attracts a growing virtual audience around the world.

In March 2021 the county offered to extend the Expo’s contract through 2030 but the Expo board has yet to act on the agreement. However talks between Expo and county officials are expected to ramp up after this week’s event.

“Our intent is to sit down with them and explore what can happen” said Bill Hageman president of the World Dairy Expo board of directors as he watched a dairy cattle show Monday from the third level of the Coliseum. “It can be a long process. In the last five years there’s been a lot of business plans and scenarios for this campus and (we want to know) how those impact our event. There’s a lot to figure out.”

Meanwhile Adam Heffron has been on the job as executive director of the Alliant Energy Center for just over 30 days. But despite his short tenure he understands the importance of World Dairy Expo not only to the county property but to the region. The event this year is expected to draw nearly 60000 people who fill hotel rooms eat at restaurants buy gas and shop pumping millions of dollars into the local economy.

“It’s our goal to do everything we can to retain them” Heffron said from behind his desk in the administration building located about 50 yards from where a line of cows was getting sprayed down with hoses. “They’ve grown much faster than we’ve grown but we’re a great fit for them.”

Any agreement would need to be approved by the Dane County Board and World Dairy Expo’s board.

Event space

The Alliant Energy Center hosts events such as the Midwest Horse Fair the Wisconsin Quarter Horse Association Dane County Fair Canoecopia the CrossFit Games concerts high school and college graduations and Brat Fest among others.

But the construction of more facilities could be a part of the negotiations between the county and the Expo. The Expo has outgrown the two New Holland pavilions constructed in 2014 and totaling 290000 square feet of space. The pavilions hold most of the 3300 dairy cows at this year’s event but because of the growth two massive dairy cattle tents have been erected just to the north of the pavilions to hold the overflow entries.

Meanwhile the 225000-square-foot Exhibition Hall constructed in 1995 is also maxed out for the Expo and is one of the reasons the Expo is forced to erect each year a temporary building called the Trade Center just east of Exhibition Hall to hold large farm machinery for some of its vendors.

“You can’t just build off of one event” Heffron said. “My charge is to understand all of the needs of the events we host and the needs of other events we hope to host.”

Hageman who has led the Expo board for the past four years and lives just north of Madison in Rio said it will be important to hear from the Expo’s stakeholders and use the strategic planning process to determine what is best for the organization. However Hageman admits it would be difficult to replicate the geographic location the history with the community and a solid base of 300 volunteers from the Madison area that are instrumental to the show’s success. Redevelopment plans of the property by the county will also be closely studied by the Expo board.

No date has been set by the board as to when it would need to make a decision.

“There’s many many many variables. It’s not just one or two things” Hageman said. “If they change access what we can and can’t do and how we can and can’t utilize it — it all has an impact.”

Supporting African entrepreneurs

We continue to support African entrepreneurs in growing their businesses and developing their talent. Our recently announced second cohort of the Black Founders Fund builds on the success of last year’s cohort who raised $97 million in follow-on funding and have employed more than 500 additional staff since they were selected. We’re also continuing our support of African small businesses through the Hustle Academy and Google Business Profiles and helping job seekers learn skills through Developer Scholarships and Career Certifications.

We’ve also continued to support nonprofits working to improve lives in Africa with a $40 million cash and in-kind commitment so far. Over the last year this has included:

$1.5M investment in Career Certifications this year bringing our total Google.org funding to more than $3M since 2021

A $3 million grant to support AirQo in expanding their work monitoring air quality from Kampala to ten cities in five countries on the continent;

A team of Googlers who have joined the Tony Elumelu Foundation for 6 months full-time and pro-bono. The team helped build a new training web and app interface to support the next million African entrepreneurs to grow and fund their businesses.

Across all our initiatives we continue to work closely with our partners – most recently with the UN to launch the Global Africa Business Initiative (GABI) aimed at accelerating Africa’s economic growth and sustainable development.

Building more helpful products for Africa

We recently announced plans to open the first African product development centre in Nairobi. The centre will develop and build better products for Africans and the world.

Today we’re launching voice typing support for nine more African languages (isiNdebele isiXhosa Kinyarwanda Northern Sotho Swati Sesotho Tswana Tshivenda and Xitsonga) in Gboard the Google keyboard – while 24 new languages are now supported on Google Translate including Lingala which is spoken by more than 45 million people across Central Africa.

We’re also extending the service to Rwanda meaning that Street View is now available in 11 African countries.

In addition to expanding the AI Accra Research Center earlier this year the Open Buildings Project which mapped buildings across the African continent using machine learning and satellite imagery is expanding to South and Southeast Asia and is a great example of the AI centre creating solutions for Africa that are useful across the world.

The suit which was filed in May 2020 alleged the search engine violated the state’s Consumer Fraud Act and misled internet users about its use of location data and data collection practices. It accused Google of continuing to track user location without consent in order to increase ad revenue even after users had turned off location history in settings.

Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich’s office began investigating Google’s location data collection practices following a 2018 Associated Press story that revealed how the search engine company tracks user movements.

“When I was elected attorney general I promised Arizonans I would fight for them and hold everyone including corporations like Google accountable” Brnovich said in a press release. “I am proud of this historic settlement that proves no entity not even big tech companies is above the law.”

The settlement includes $77250000 paid to Arizona’s general fund and another $7750000 to the outside counsel of the attorney general’s office. The bulk of the settlement will be used by the Arizona legislature to fund education broadband and internet privacy efforts and purposes.

Under the terms of the settlement Google will not have to admit to any wrongdoing or violation of laws.

Google Argued Suit Was Based On Outdated Policies Changed Years Ago

In its defense Google claimed Arizona’s lawsuit was based on outdated policies that are no longer in use.

“We provide straightforward controls and auto delete options for location data and are always working to minimize the data we collect” Google spokesman Jose Castañeda said in a statement. “We are pleased to have this matter resolved and will continue to focus our attention on providing useful products for our users.”

In 2021 ad revenue accounted for 81% ($209.5 billion) of Google’s $257.6 billion earnings. Much of this is generated by collecting user data with or without express consent and/or knowledge.

If as Google claims the lawsuit is based on policies no longer in practice this settlement should not significantly impact those earnings.

The search engine giant previously attempted to have the case dismissed arguing that state consumer protection laws require alleged fraud to be connected to a sale or advertisement. A judge denied this request in January.

Google Facing A Number Of Similar Suits

This Arizona case is just one of several privacy-violation lawsuits Google is facing. Similar complaints have been filed by a group of state attorneys general including Indiana Texas and the District of Columbia over location data in their respective state courts.

In January 2022 a California U.S. District Judge threw out two of five claims in a class action lawsuit that accused Google of collecting app data from Android users in a similar manner to those outlined by the Arizona Attorney General. Alphabet Inc. did not seek to have the three other claims dismissed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xlZ2FsL2xpdGlnYXRpb24vZ29vZ2xlLXdpbnMtYmlkLWJsb2NrLXF1ZXN0aW9uaW5nLWNlby1waWNoYWktcHJpdmFjeS1sYXdzdWl0LTIwMjItMTAtMDQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google wins bid to block questioning of CEO Pichai in privacy lawsuit,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/google-wins-bid-block-questioning-ceo-pichai-privacy-lawsuit-2022-10-04/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xlZ2FsL2xpdGlnYXRpb24vZ29vZ2xlLXdpbnMtYmlkLWJsb2NrLXF1ZXN0aW9uaW5nLWNlby1waWNoYWktcHJpdmFjeS1sYXdzdWl0LTIwMjItMTAtMDQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The suit which was filed in May 2020 alleged the search engine violated the state’s Consumer Fraud Act and misled internet users about its use of location data and data collection practices. It accused Google of continuing to track user location without consent in order to increase ad revenue even after users had turned off location history in settings.

Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich’s office began investigating Google’s location data collection practices following a 2018 Associated Press story that revealed how the search engine company tracks user movements.

“When I was elected attorney general I promised Arizonans I would fight for them and hold everyone including corporations like Google accountable” Brnovich said in a press release. “I am proud of this historic settlement that proves no entity not even big tech companies is above the law.”

The settlement includes $77250000 paid to Arizona’s general fund and another $7750000 to the outside counsel of the attorney general’s office. The bulk of the settlement will be used by the Arizona legislature to fund education broadband and internet privacy efforts and purposes.

Under the terms of the settlement Google will not have to admit to any wrongdoing or violation of laws.

Google Argued Suit Was Based On Outdated Policies Changed Years Ago

In its defense Google claimed Arizona’s lawsuit was based on outdated policies that are no longer in use.

“We provide straightforward controls and auto delete options for location data and are always working to minimize the data we collect” Google spokesman Jose Castañeda said in a statement. “We are pleased to have this matter resolved and will continue to focus our attention on providing useful products for our users.”

In 2021 ad revenue accounted for 81% ($209.5 billion) of Google’s $257.6 billion earnings. Much of this is generated by collecting user data with or without express consent and/or knowledge.

If as Google claims the lawsuit is based on policies no longer in practice this settlement should not significantly impact those earnings.

The search engine giant previously attempted to have the case dismissed arguing that state consumer protection laws require alleged fraud to be connected to a sale or advertisement. A judge denied this request in January.

Google Facing A Number Of Similar Suits

This Arizona case is just one of several privacy-violation lawsuits Google is facing. Similar complaints have been filed by a group of state attorneys general including Indiana Texas and the District of Columbia over location data in their respective state courts.

In January 2022 a California U.S. District Judge threw out two of five claims in a class action lawsuit that accused Google of collecting app data from Android users in a similar manner to those outlined by the Arizona Attorney General. Alphabet Inc. did not seek to have the three other claims dismissed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xlZ2FsL2xpdGlnYXRpb24vZ29vZ2xlLXdpbnMtYmlkLWJsb2NrLXF1ZXN0aW9uaW5nLWNlby1waWNoYWktcHJpdmFjeS1sYXdzdWl0LTIwMjItMTAtMDQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google wins bid to block questioning of CEO Pichai in privacy lawsuit,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/google-wins-bid-block-questioning-ceo-pichai-privacy-lawsuit-2022-10-04/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xlZ2FsL2xpdGlnYXRpb24vZ29vZ2xlLXdpbnMtYmlkLWJsb2NrLXF1ZXN0aW9uaW5nLWNlby1waWNoYWktcHJpdmFjeS1sYXdzdWl0LTIwMjItMTAtMDQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

In other words Juul has been “preparing” for a potential bankruptcy filing for at least three months.

Chapter 11 allows a company to continue operating while it works with a court and its creditors to reorganize its finances. It doesn’t necessarily signal the death of the company.

The Journal reported Tuesday evening that Juul has received inquiries from lenders and “will soon formally request debtor-in-possession financing options” which (if pursued) would allow the company to maintain operations during the bankruptcy process. Bloomberg News reported essentially the same thing.

(One Medical Image)

As Amazon makes bigger moves into healthcare and turns its efficiency machine on medicine some experts say the industry could change in big ways.

“It’s the start of Amazon climbing a mountain” said Derek Streat a health technology veteran and CEO of Seattle healthcare software startup DexCare.

That mountain is certainly steep. Amazon has already spent years investing heavily in healthcare with mixed results. The company last year ended its Haven joint venture with Berkshire Hathaway and JP Morgan Chase. It recently announced plans to shut down its virtual-first service Amazon Care.

But Amazon signaled its continued interest in healthcare this summer when it announced a $3.9 billion acquisition of primary care group One Medical. The deal which would be Amazon’s third-largest acquisition ever is still being reviewed by regulators.

Given the size complexity and potential for technology to further transform the healthcare market the sector has emerged as one of the most likely industries where Amazon could find a fourth pillar of its business alongside its existing three: Amazon Web Services Amazon Prime and Amazon Marketplace.

We spoke with healthcare industry leaders to learn more about how the tech giant might use its tech and data prowess to disrupt yet another market.

Amazon has a broad set of offerings that it can build on and scale

Amazon already partners with health companies through Amazon Web Services for Health supporting everything from finance and operations to medical research and patient-clinician interactions. AWS provides tools to mine health data collect revenue power virtual care and more.

The company is likely to expand on each of these efforts scale them and link them to devices like its Halo View health band its Amazon.com e-commerce marketplace and its online pharmacy said Streat.

Amazon’s planned acquisition of One Medical — which would be its third-largest acquisition ever — is similar to how Facebook (now Meta) scooped up Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 said Streat whose startup spun out of Providence’s digital innovation group.

“‘We can take this little thing and put it into our engine and it will be amazing’” said Streat of Facebook’s thinking. “And I think this is the same. If you’re Amazon you think at that scale.”

Amazon’s logistics expertise may be useful for healthcare

The industry is plagued by inefficiencies from delays in care multiple follow-ups for tests fragmented data systems and supply chain issues. Experts said Amazon could partner across multiple health systems to strip out inefficiency and help deliver supplies and services.

“Amazon’s extraordinary supply chain management and consumer e-commerce platform could be unparalleled assets for selling and delivering goods where they are needed” said physician Ken Mandl director of the Computational Health Informatics Program at Boston Children’s Hospital.

Lee Schwamm a physician and vice president of digital patient experience and virtual care at Mass General Brigham said Amazon could be a “single supplier” and find a way to generate substantial revenue “in a way that it knows how to do.”

Amazon which acquired online pharmacy startup PillPack in 2018 and later launched Amazon Pharmacy in 2020 could also further blur the distinctions between at-home care and care at a hospital or clinic. “It’s probably going to lead with diagnostics tied to asynchronous care delivery for certain specialty areas that you could transition to 100% virtualized care” said Streat who previously co-founded C-SATS a Seattle startup that used technology to grade surgeons and was acquired by Johnson & Johnson in 2018.

One example would be diabetes management through home diagnostics said Streat. “They can virtualize entire service lines” he said. In the future people may spend less time recovering in the hospital from illness and surgery and more time at home.

Health systems could benefit from Amazon’s data expertise

Amazon has the potential to help health systems manage their data understand patient outcomes and provide real time feedback to clinicians. With enough data Amazon could help catch signs of illness early predict patient outcomes and even guide people to medical care or healthier consumer choices.

“Healthcare suffers from a lack of coordination resulting in long diagnostic odysseys unnecessary and duplicate testing and medical errors” said Mandl. “One Medical could give AWS healthcare data integration and machine learning solutions a role in managing medical records and providing decision support to clinicians and patients.”

Amazon already has access to huge datasets on consumer habits through its marketplace. And while health data is protected by federal privacy regulations the company could find a way to combine it with consumer data such as by offering incentives or discounts said Mandl. It could also augment its datasets with at-home connected services.

The result could be a lot of information on each patient.

“That data fed into their data science technologies and teams will make them incredibly effective on the predictive side of the [health] equation” Streat said.

There are barriers to effectively using data to predict and effect health outcomes. Consumer health data is a thicket often siloed in different health groups and beset with jargon that obscures meaning. Previous tech efforts to improve healthcare through data have fallen flat such as Google’s consumer effort Google Health and IBM’s Watson Health.

But Amazon may ultimately overcome some of these difficulties as software tools improve and its access to data broadens. The company could ultimately even improve electronic medical record systems widely viewed as onerous time consuming and technologically inflexible said Streat.

Cause for concern

Amazon will need to overcome concerns over data privacy — both from regulators and business partners.

On the same day Amazon announced the One Medical deal Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) wrote a letter to the Federal Trade Commission.

“I also ask that the FTC consider the role of data including as a potential barrier to entry given that this proposed deal could result in the accumulation of highly sensitive personal health data in the hands of an already data-intensive company” wrote Klobuchar who chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Competition Policy Antitrust and Consumer Rights.

Amazon also needs to be careful about how it collects and uses data to gain patient and physician trust a key factor in healthcare said Shantanu Nundy chief medical officer of healthcare company Accolade. “Medicine moves at the speed of trust” he said.

The acquisition of One Medical presents other potential issues for Amazon as it dives deeper into healthcare.

One Medical is a primary healthcare service and bumps patients to other providers for specialty care.

But academic medical centers like Mass General Brigham make their margins by building up a large primary case patient base that in turn supports specialty care. Amazon could potentially use its data to skim off the wealthiest and healthiest patients leaving hospitals to serve as a safety net for the poorest said Schamm. That could leave hospitals in financial jeopardy added Streat who notes that rural health systems are particularly vulnerable.

Schwamm also worries about Amazon funneling specialty care through One Medical. Amazon could reserve “slots” with specialists granting expedited access to its patients and skewing access to patients outside its system.

Schwamm said that under certain scenarios everyone wins in the long term: Amazon existing healthcare groups and patients. Under a single-payer health system for instance Amazon would contract with the government and hospitals would stay afloat — though that’s not a likely scenario and one Amazon would probably resist said Schwamm.

Health systems should start thinking now about how they are going to adapt to the entry of Amazon and other big tech players into healthcare said Schwamm. He asks: “Do we find a way to collaborate and basically transform academic health systems into tertiary care networks which is really what they ought to be and let primary care evolve into something more fluid?”

“My prediction is no one’s going to get it right on the first pass” said Schwamm. “But there’s going to be a lot of learning that goes on.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFib3V0YW1hem9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2RldmljZXMvYW1hem9uLWlzLW1ha2luZy15b3VyLWxpZmUtZWFzaWVyLXRocm91Z2gtYW1iaWVudC1pbnRlbGxpZ2VuY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon is making your life easier through ambient intelligence,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.aboutamazon.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/devices/amazon-is-making-your-life-easier-through-ambient-intelligence (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC8284AC0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFib3V0YW1hem9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2RldmljZXMvYW1hem9uLWlzLW1ha2luZy15b3VyLWxpZmUtZWFzaWVyLXRocm91Z2gtYW1iaWVudC1pbnRlbGxpZ2VuY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS9sb2NhbC9zZWF0dGxlLzIwMjIvMTAvMDQvZGVsaXZlcnktZHJpdmVycy1zdWUtYW1hem9uLXdhZ2UtdGhlZnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delivery drivers sue Amazon again for failure to offer meal bathroom breaks,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS9sb2NhbC9zZWF0dGxlLzIwMjIvMTAvMDQvZGVsaXZlcnktZHJpdmVycy1zdWUtYW1hem9uLXdhZ2UtdGhlZnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC8285A80>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS9sb2NhbC9zZWF0dGxlLzIwMjIvMTAvMDQvZGVsaXZlcnktZHJpdmVycy1zdWUtYW1hem9uLXdhZ2UtdGhlZnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL2F3cy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2Jsb2dzL2NvbXB1dGUvYW5ub3VuY2luZy1zZXJ2ZXItc2lkZS1lbmNyeXB0aW9uLXdpdGgtYW1hem9uLXNpbXBsZS1xdWV1ZS1zZXJ2aWNlLW1hbmFnZWQtZW5jcnlwdGlvbi1rZXlzLXNzZS1zcXMtYnktZGVmYXVsdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Announcing server-side encryption with Amazon Simple Queue Service -managed encryption keys (SSE-SQS) by ...,"This post is written by Sofiya Muzychko (Sr Product Manager) Nipun Chagari (Principal Solutions Architect) and Hardik Vasa (Senior Solutions Architect).

Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) now provides server-side encryption (SSE) using SQS-owned encryption (SSE-SQS) by default. This feature further simplifies the security posture to encrypt the message body in SQS queues.

SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices distributed systems and serverless applications. Customers are increasingly decoupling their monolithic applications to microservices and moving sensitive workloads to SQS such as financial and healthcare applications whose compliance regulations mandate data encryption.

SQS already supports server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys using the AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) or using SQS-owned encryption keys (SSE-SQS). Both encryption options greatly reduce the operational burden and complexity involved in protecting data. Additionally with the SSE-SQS encryption type you do not need to create manage or pay for SQS-managed encryption keys.

Using the default encryption

With this feature all newly created queues using HTTPS (TLS) and Signature Version 4 endpoints are encrypted using SQS-owned encryption (SSE-SQS) by default enhancing the protection of your data against unauthorized access. Any new queue created using the non-TLS endpoint will not enable SSE-SQS encryption by default. We hence encourage you to create SQS queues using HTTPS endpoints as a security best practice.

The SSE-SQS default encryption is available for both standard and FIFO. You do not need to make any code or application changes to encrypt new queues. This does not affect existing queues. You can however change the encryption option for existing queues at any time using the SQS console AWS Command Line Interface or API.

The preceding image shows the SQS queue creation console wizard with configuration options for encryption. As you can see server-side encryption is enabled by default with encryption key type SSE-SQS option selected.

Creating a new SQS queue with SSE-SQS encryption using AWS CloudFormation

Default SSE-SQS encryption is also supported in AWS CloudFormation. To learn more see this documentation page.

Here is the sample CloudFormation template to create an SQS standard queue with SQS owned Server Side Encryption (SSE-SQS) explicitly enabled.

AWSTemplateFormatVersion: ""2010-09-09"" Description: SSE-SQS Cloudformation template Resources: SQSEncryptionQueue: Type: AWS::SQS::Queue Properties: MaximumMessageSize: 262144 MessageRetentionPeriod: 86400 QueueName: SSESQSQueue SqsManagedSseEnabled: true KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds: 900 VisibilityTimeout: 30

Note that if the SqsManagedSseEnabled: true property is not specified SSE-SQS is enabled by default.

Configuring SSE-SQS encryption for existing queues vis AWS Management Console

To configure SSE-SQS encryption for an existing queue using the SQS console:

Navigate to the SQS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/sqs/. In the navigation pane choose Queues. Select a queue and then choose Edit. Under the Encryption dialog box for Server-side encryption choose Enabled. Select Amazon SQS key (SSE-SQS). Choose Save.

To configure SSE-SQS encryption for an existing queue using the AWS CLI

To enable SSE-SQS to an existing queue with no encryption use the following AWS CLI command

aws sqs set-queue-attributes --queue-url <queueURL> --attributes SqsManagedSseEnabled=true

Replace <queueURL> with the URL of your SQS queue.

To disable SSE-SQS for an existing queue using the AWS CLI run:

aws sqs set-queue-attributes --queue-url <queueURL> --attributes SqsManagedSseEnabled=false

Testing the queue with the SSE-SQS encryption enabled

To test sending message to the SQS queue with SSE-SQS enabled run:

aws sqs send-message --queue-url <queueURL> --message-body test-message

Replace <queueURL> with the URL of your SQS queue. You see the following response which means the message is successfully sent to the queue:

{ ""MD5OfMessageBody"": ""beaa0032306f083e847cbf86a09ba9b2"" ""MessageId"": ""6e53de76-7865-4c45-a640-f058c24a619b"" }

Default SSE-SQS and encrypted messages

Encrypting a message makes its contents unavailable to unauthorized or anonymous users. Anonymous requests are requests made to a queue that is open to a public network without any authentication. Note if you are using anonymous SendMessage and ReceiveMessage requests to the newly created queues the requests will now be rejected with SSE-SQS enabled by default.

Making anonymous requests to SQS queues does not follow SQS security best practices. We strongly recommend updating your policy to make signed requests to SQS queues using AWS SDK or AWS CLI and to continue using SSE-SQS enabled by default.

Look at the SQS service response for anonymous messages when SSE-SQS encryption is enabled. For an existing queue you can change the queue policy to grant all users (anonymous users) SendMessage permission for a queue named EncryptionQueue:

{ ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"" ""Id"": ""Queue1_Policy_UUID"" ""Statement"": [ { ""Sid"": ""Queue1_SendMessage"" ""Effect"": ""Allow"" ""Principal"": ""*"" ""Action"": ""sqs:SendMessage"" ""Resource"": ""<queueARN>"" } ] }

You can then make an anonymous request against the queue:

curl <queueURL> -d 'Action=SendMessage&MessageBody=Hello'

You get an error message similar to the following:

<?xml version=""1.0""?> <ErrorResponse xmlns=""http://queue.amazonaws.com/doc/2012-11-05/""> <Error> <Type>Sender</Type> <Code>AccessDenied</Code> <Message>Access to the resource The specified queue does not exist or you do not have access to it. is denied.</Message> <Detail/> </Error> <RequestId> RequestID </RequestId> </ErrorResponse>

However for any reason if you want to continue using anonymous requests to the newly created queues in the future you must create or update the queue with SSE-SQS encryption disabled.

SqsManagedSseEnabled=false

You can also disable the SSE-SQS using the Amazon SQS console.

Encrypting SQS queues with your own encryption keys

You can always change the default of SSE-SQS queues encryption and use your own keys. To encrypt SQS queues with your own encryption keys using the AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) the default encryption with SSE-SQS can be overwritten to SSE-KMS during the queue creation process or afterwards.

You can update the SQS queue Server-side encryption key type using the Amazon SQS console AWS Command Line Interface or API.

Benefits of SQS owned encryption (SSE-SQS)

There are a number of significant benefits to encrypting your data with SQS owned encryption (SSE-SQS):

SSE-SQS lets you transmit data more securely and improve your security posture commonly required for compliance and regulations with no additional overhead as you do not need to create and manage encryption keys.

Encryption at rest using the default SSE-SQS is provided at no additional charge.

The encryption and decryption of your data are handled transparently and continue to deliver the same performance you expect.

Data is encrypted using the 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256 GCM algorithm) so that only authorized roles and services can access data.

In addition customers can enable CloudWatch Alarms to alarm on activities such as authorization failures AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy changes or tampering with CloudTrail logs to help detect and stay on top of security incidents in the customer application (to learn more see Amazon CloudWatch User Guide).

Conclusion

SQS now provides server-side encryption (SSE) using SQS-owned encryption (SSE-SQS) by default. This enhancement makes it easier to create SQS queues while greatly reducing the operational burden and complexity involved in protecting data.

Encryption at rest using the default SSE-SQS is provided at no additional charge and is supported for both Standard and FIFO SQS queues using HTTPS endpoints. The default SSE-SQS encryption is available now.

Using the mass balance approach the post-consumer recycled plastic packaging will be independently certified by ISCC and supplied in partnership with Amcor a global leader in developing and producing responsible packaging for food and other industries and signals the high demand for this material within the UK.

The company said it is part of its wider global goal to reduce the use of virgin plastic material in its overall plastic packaging portfolio by 5% by 2025 ‘assuming constant portfolio mix’.

Mondelēz said this latest project on Cadbury Dairy Milk is another example of how it is delivering the company’s‘ Pack Light and Right’ sustainable packaging strategy and its efforts toward the UK Plastic Pact targets.

Dirk Van de Put CEO Mondelēz International said the UK is leading the way in its use of recycled material and investing in solutions for a circular economy for packaging waste. “Until recently flexible plastic packaging has been considered a single use material. The development of advanced recycling technology and our significant investment in this material means it’s now possible for Cadbury fans to enjoy their favourite sharing bars more sustainably here in the UK​.”

Earlier this year Mondelēz International again joined forces with the industry to lead finance and launch the UK’s biggest flexible plastic household collection and recycling pilot – Flex Collect. The pilot will inform UK Government how to incorporate flexible packaging into existing collection services across different geographies and demographics developing best practice and giving confidence to the recycling and packaging supply chain to invest in advanced recycling facilities that can process this material.

Van de Put said the company is committed to using more recycled packaging as access and availability of advanced recycling technology increases.

“I am enormously proud to witness this important innovation to our iconic Cadbury packaging made in Bournville – the heart and home of Cadbury” ​said Louise Stigant UK Managing Director Mondelēz International.“We are very keen to reduce our use of virgin plastic across our full range and this innovation signals our demand for this material and much needed investment into the UK recycling infrastructure to produce it​.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdyb2NlcnlnYXpldHRlLmNvLnVrLzIwMjIvMTAvMDQvbW9uZGVsZXotY2FkYnVyeS1wYWNrYWdpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mondelēz launches new Cadbury Dairy Milk packaging to reduce plastic waste,"Mondelēz has launched new packaging across its Cadbury Dairy Milk and Cadbury Mini Snowballs sharing bars to include 30% certified recycled plastic.

Rolled out across over 28 million of its sharing bars the move comes as part of the food manufacturer‘s goal to reduce its use of virgin plastic material in its overall plastic packaging portfolio by 5% by 2025.

Supplied in partnership with packaging solution company Amcor the new packaging is certified by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC).

The Sierra Club’s “Dirty Truth About Utility Climate Pledges” report gave Evergy an 18% for its investments in clean energy and moves to retire coal plants. Ameren Missouri got a 32%.

Worst was Associated Electric Cooperatives Inc. which serves small electric utilities in Missouri. It received a zero percent for its lack of plans to add sources of renewable energy by 2030.

Jenn DeRose Missouri’s campaign representative for the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign said there was “no excuse for moving slowly on the clean energy transition.”

“Ameren AECI and Evergy have known for decades that burning fossil fuels exacerbates the extreme heat drought wildfires and floods that we’re seeing in the Midwest” DeRose said.

The report marks Sierra Club’s second annual report measuring utilities based on their plans to retire coal plants build clean energy generators and avoid adding new natural gas plants. Both Ameren and Evergy gained a few points from last year but AECI lost ground.

“Kansas is uniquely positioned to be a global leader in wind and solar generation which makes it disappointing that Evergy is not more ambitious in its forward-looking transition from coal and gas to clean energy” said Ty Gorman Kansas campaign representative for Sierra Club.

Evergy

Evergy serves 1.6 million customers across the Kansas City metropolitan area and much of eastern Kansas and Western Missouri.

The company has set a target to reduce emissions 50% by 2040 and achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2045. It plans to stop burning coal at its Lawrence Energy Center and add renewable energy in the next few years though it backed off of more ambitious plans.

Since Sierra Club’s first report Evergy has trimmed coal and gas generation though its capacity increased. It plans to retire more coal production and add more clean energy by 2030. But it plans to replace just 28% of its coal and gas generation by 2030 according to the report.

In a statement Evergy’s spokeswoman Gina Penzig said the company “has made industry leading progress in increasing sustainability and providing our customers with clean energy.”

Compared to 2005 she said Evergy has reduced carbon emissions by almost half and add 4400 megawatts of renewable energy generation and retired 2400 megawatts of fossil generation.

“Evergy’s clean energy plans are appropriately timed and balanced to maintain reliability and affordability while advancing our clean energy goals” Penzig said adding that the report doesn’t acknowledge progress and “reflects only their narrow mission to eliminate all fossil fuel generation immediately.”

Gorman said Evergy has to look just to the south at the Public Service Company of Oklahoma which received a 100% score in the report for retiring coal plants expanding renewable energy and avoiding building new gas plants.

“Other utilities are demonstrating that it’s technically achievable” Gorman said. “Now it’s up to Evergy’s leadership to make it happen.”

Ameren

Ameren provides power to St. Louis and much of eastern Missouri and the bootheel.

The company announced this summer it would achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2045 five years sooner than its previous plan. It gained points in the Sierra Club’s report for plans to add more wind and solar power provide energy efficiency programs and retire its Rush Island coal plant though that is required by court order.

Ameren’s chief renewable development officer Ajay Arora said in a statement that the utility’s updated plan “safeguards reliability and resilience for customers for years to come while focusing on affordability.” Arora said the company has accelerated the pace of new wind and solar generation additions by 2030 and plans to retire four fossil-fired energy centers in Missouri and Illinois in the same timeline.

“By investing billions of dollars in clean energy we anticipate creating thousands of jobs growing our solid base of carbon-free generation and supporting communities across Missouri” he said.

Ameren however plans to add a gas and hydrogen plant in 2031.

AECI

According to the Sierra Club AECI has no stated climate goals and no plans to retire coal plants or add additional sources of renewable energy by 2030

AECI did not return a request for comment.",,,,,,,,,

The union representing 50 maintenance technicians and crew chiefs at the busiest airport in the United Kingdom voted almost unanimously Tuesday to authorize a strike after turning down a proposal from Fort Worth-based American Airlines for 3.8% to 5.3% pay raises. The union could authorize a strike in a matter of days compromising American Airlines flights to London from destinations in the United States including DFW International Airport and New York’s JFK.

The Unite Here union representing those American Airlines maintenance workers in London said the pay raises don’t keep up with a U.K. inflation rate that is higher than 12%.

London Heathrow is American’s most important destination outside of the United States with up to 23 flights a day there. While American has more flights to Mexico’s top destinations those routes don’t rival the number of available seat miles used on American Airlines flights to London the most important measure of capacity in the airline industry.

“We are looking to make sure our members are protected against the rising cost of living” said Joe McGowan a regional officer for Unite Here in the United Kingdom. “We need something that would protect our members against the erosion of wages.”

American has also offered a lump sum payment in the second year of the three-year contract but McGowan said lump sum payments don’t give permanent protections against the increasing cost of living. There was no extra money offered in the third year of the contract he said.

A spokeswoman for American Airlines said there is no impact to operations at London Heathrow for now.

“At American we’re committed to making sure all of our team members are paid well and competitively” American Airlines spokeswoman Lindsey Martin. “We’re disappointed we haven’t yet been able to reach a pay agreement with UNITE that will ensure our London-based Aviation Maintenance Technicians (AMT) continue to receive industry-leading pay but we remain committed to reaching an agreement as quickly as possible.”

Some 98% of maintenance workers at Heathrow approved of the strike the union said. In order to strike the union would need to give the airline 14 days notice which it has not done yet. The airline and the union are set to meet with British government mediators tomorrow and McGowan hopes progress can be made then.

Inflation has been a thorny issue for airlines in the United States and abroad combined with a broad labor shortage and supply chain issues to drive up wages for union and nonunion workers. American is also in contract fights with key labor groups representing pilots and flight attendants which have each picketed at airports nationwide and filed with federal regulators for mediation.

American Airlines pilots are looking for raises upward of 20% on top of scheduling improvements.

Heathrow maintenance workers for American Airlines are Federal Aviation Administration certified which McGowan said makes them a “bespoke skill set” in the region.

The airport has been a pain point for international travel this year because of labor shortages and flight disruptions that came during a surge in leisure travel. Caps on flight capacity were lifted last month.

American Airlines did come to an agreement with a group representing 300 other workers at Heathrow earlier this year McGowan said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9kYWxsYXMvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzEwLzA1L2FtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLWhvdGVsLWhlYWRxdWFydGVycy1vcGVuaW5nLmh0bWzSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaXpqb3VybmFscy5jb20vZGFsbGFzL25ld3MvMjAyMi8xMC8wNS9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1ob3RlbC1oZWFkcXVhcnRlcnMtb3BlbmluZy5hbXAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First look: On-campus hotel at American Airlines HQ on track to open in early 2023,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9kYWxsYXMvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzEwLzA1L2FtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLWhvdGVsLWhlYWRxdWFydGVycy1vcGVuaW5nLmh0bWzSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaXpqb3VybmFscy5jb20vZGFsbGFzL25ld3MvMjAyMi8xMC8wNS9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1ob3RlbC1oZWFkcXVhcnRlcnMtb3BlbmluZy5hbXAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC7CB76D0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9kYWxsYXMvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzEwLzA1L2FtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLWhvdGVsLWhlYWRxdWFydGVycy1vcGVuaW5nLmh0bWzSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaXpqb3VybmFscy5jb20vZGFsbGFzL25ld3MvMjAyMi8xMC8wNS9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1ob3RlbC1oZWFkcXVhcnRlcnMtb3BlbmluZy5hbXAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYWRkbGV5b3Vyb3dua2Fub28uY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMDUvYW1lcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtZmFjZXMtdHJhbnNhdGxhbnRpYy1kaXNydXB0aW9uLWFzLW1haW50ZW5hbmNlLXdvcmtlcnMtYXQtbG9uZG9ucy1oZWF0aHJvdy12b3RlLXRvLXN0cmlrZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines Faces Transatlantic Disruption as Maintenance Workers at London's Heathrow Vote to Strike,"American Airlines is facing the potential for serious disruption on its transatlantic flights between 10 U.S. cities and London’s Heathrow International Airport (HAL) after a small group of around 50 aircraft maintenance workers and crew chiefs voted overwhelmingly in favor of staging strike action in a dispute over pay.

Without any maintenance workers at hand at one of AA’s biggest international hubs even the smallest technical defect could mean that an aircraft would have to be grounded.

The workers voted 98 per cent in favor of staging a walkout after rejecting an “appalling” pay offer that the Unite union claims amounts to a pay cut in real terms.

“Amid a cost-of-living emergency American Airlines is proposing that our members accept a three-year pay cut” slammed the union’s national general secretary Sharon Graham after the results of the ballot were revealed on Wednesday.

“That is simply unacceptable” Graham continued. “As the strength of this vote shows our members are rock solid and ready to strike for a fair deal”

American Airlines has proposed increasing pay for its Heathrow-based maintenance technicians by 5.3 per cent this year and then paying a lump sum next year. Pay would be frozen for the whole of 2024.

Crew chiefs meanwhile would only receive a 3.8 per cent pay rise this year and a lump sum in 2023.

American Airlines serves Heathrow with as many as 172 flights per week from 10 U.S. cities and the union believes it would be difficult for the airline to source maintenance workers who hold the correct qualifications during any potential strike.

The 50 workers based at Heathrow are licenced by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and are trained in the United States

To make matters even worse for transatlantic travelers around 300 workers employed by United Airlines at Heathrow are also currently being balloted for strike action by the Unite union.

Workers including check-in agents baggage handlers and operations employees are unhappy with a pay offer that falls below the 12.3 per cent rate of inflation. The ballot closes next Tuesday.

The UK airline said in a statement Wednesday that several factors contributed to its decision including on the basis of Russian airspace remaining closed that Heathrow-Hong Kong-Heathrow flight times would be at least one hour longer and that in 2019 Virgin Australia ended Hong Kong-Melbourne and Hong Kong-Sydney services reducing the number of connecting customers to and from Australia.

Virgin Atlantic hasn’t operated any passenger flights to Hong Kong since December after the city banned all flights from the UK during the depths of Covid. However the carrier is the first major airline to actually pull out since American Airlines Group Inc. quit the hub late last year.

Around 46 Virgin Atlantic jobs will be impacted consisting of a mix of office staff and cabin crew.

“We’re very sorry for the disappointment caused to our loyal customers on this route and anyone booked to travel from March 2023 will be offered a refund voucher or the option to rebook on an alternative Virgin Atlantic route”​ Virgin said in its statement.

It explained that “significant operational complexities due to the ongoing Russian airspace closure have contributed to the commercial decision not to resume flights in March 2023 as planned.”

Virgin told trade members in a separate message that the Hong Kong route was on a trend of declining profitability even before the pandemic.

“We’re constantly reviewing the performance of our network and as part of our long term strategy of being sustainably profitable” the airline said in a memo to corporate customers seen by Bloomberg. “We’re committed to only flying profitable routes.”

Virgin said it still intended to resume flights to Shanghai."

Strategic review of retail energy business will begin; company on track to divest unregulated renewable assets and complete Kentucky sale

COLUMBUS Ohio Oct. 4 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- American Electric Power (Nasdaq: AEP) plans to invest in its regulated businesses accelerate its carbon reduction targets and streamline the business to drive value for customers communities and investors. AEP leadership will share the company's financial plan and strategy with analysts in New York City today. The presentation will be webcast live at 1:30 p.m. ET at https://aep.com/investors/events.

AEP narrowed its 2022 operating earnings (earnings excluding special items) guidance range to $4.97-$5.07 per share raising the midpoint to $5.02 per share. The company also announced its 2023 operating earnings guidance range of $5.19 to $5.39 per share with a projected annual operating earnings growth rate of 6% to 7%.

Operating earnings could differ from those prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for matters such as impairments divestitures or changes in accounting principles. AEP is unable to forecast if any of these items will occur or any amounts that may be recorded for future periods. Therefore AEP is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for earnings guidance.

""AEP is committed to providing maximum value to our customers and stakeholders while de-risking and simplifying the business through active management of our portfolio"" said Julie Sloat AEP president and chief financial officer. ""Our strategic vision prioritizes delivering clean reliable energy and service offerings that boost and empower the communities we serve all while maintaining affordability for our customers and offering significant shareholder value.""

The company plans to invest $40 billion in capital from 2023 through 2027 with an emphasis on transmission distribution and renewable energy. AEP will allocate $26 billion to transmission and distribution operations to continue building a modern efficient reliable and resilient energy grid. During the same period AEP plans to invest $9 billion in regulated renewable generation.

""Nearly all of our capital will be allocated to our regulated businesses and 90% of our future investment will focus on wires and renewables"" Sloat said. ""This approach will enable us to enhance service for customers advance the clean energy transition and take advantage of a robust pipeline of growth opportunities in the grid and renewable energy space. Our high-growth transmission business has a long runway of investment opportunities focused on improving system performance increasing reliability and resiliency and enhancing market efficiency.""

As the company transitions to a clean energy future AEP is adjusting its near-term carbon dioxide emission reduction target from a 2000 baseline to a 2005 baseline upgrading its 80% reduction by 2030 target to include full Scope 1 emissions and accelerating its net-zero goal by five years to 2045.

""AEP has a proven track record of reducing fleet emissions and repeatedly has reached our goals ahead of schedule"" said Nicholas K. Akins AEP chair and chief executive officer. ""Raising our carbon reduction targets reflects our progress in reducing our environmental footprint and delivering more low-emissions energy to our customers.

Instead of transitioning quickly to clean energy according to the report many utilities in the US are propping up aging coal plants and expanding polluting gas infrastructure.

“These companies’ supposed climate commitments are mostly greenwashing” says the report published yesterday by environmental group Sierra Club and University of California Santa Barbara associate professor Leah Stokes. In other words utilities are paying lip service to climate change without doing enough to actually tackle the crisis.

“These companies’ supposed climate commitments are mostly greenwashing”

The assessment of US utilities includes 77 operating companies from 50 parent utility companies that generate the most electricity from coal and gas. The report’s authors rated companies based on how much progress they’re making to cut planet-heating emissions from fossil fuels. On a scale of from 1 to 100 — with 100 being stellar environmental performance — the companies’ aggregate score was a low 21 equivalent to a low “D.”

Forty out of the 50 parent companies studied have some kind of goal to reduce their impact on the climate. They scored only marginally higher earning 23 points out of 100 which the report says “suggests that most utilities’ corporate pledges are not translating into action.”

That shows that utilities haven’t improved much since last year when they earned an aggregate score of 17 out of 100 points in the first iteration of the report published in 2021. What’s even more worrisome is that more than a third of companies actually scored worse this year than they did last year and about a tenth of them made no progress at all.

The scores are based on three main criteria: each utility’s plans to retire coal plants quit building new gas plants and install or purchase more clean energy like wind and solar as of July 2022. If you want to know whether your utility made passing or failing grades Sierra Club has a search tool on its website. Users can type in a particular utility to see how it ranks compared to others in the assessment and what letter grade the company earned similar to report cards in school with A through F grades.

One of “greenwashing’s worst offenders” according to the report is the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). It got an F grade with its score falling from nine points in 2021 to two points this year. The utility has only committed to retiring 3 percent of its coal generation this decade according to the report. It also has plans to build up more gas infrastructure this decade than all but one of the other parent companies in the assessment.

Meanwhile TVA’s existing plans to add more clean energy this decade amount to just 19 percent of its existing fossil fuel generation. In an email to The Verge however TVA says it has a plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels by 70 percent by 2030. “This report does not reflect TVA’s decarbonization efforts as listed in our Strategic Intent and Guiding Principles framework” TVA senior partner for strategic communications and media relations Ashton Davies said in the email.

Brian Reil a spokesperson for the Edison Electric Group an association representing investor-owned utilities in the US called Sierra Club’s criteria for the report “arbitrary.” But there’s research to back up the standards to which the report holds companies accountable. Landmark assessments from the United Nations and academic researchers have found that economies need to essentially phase out coal by 2030 and quit building new gas infrastructure in order to avoid the worst effects of climate change.

Joe Biden has committed the US to cutting its CO2 emissions at least in half from peak levels under the Paris climate agreement. The linchpin for achieving that goal is a carbon pollution-free power grid which Biden aims to do by 2035. Not only would a clean grid erase a quarter of the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions that come from electricity but it can also clean up other sectors if cars homes and buildings eventually go all-electric.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vbWljaGlnYW5hZHZhbmNlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEwLzA1L2FtaWQtYS1tYXNzaXZlLWFtZXJpY2FuLWNsZWFuLWVuZXJneS1zaGlmdC1ncmlkLW9wZXJhdG9ycy1wbGF5LWNhdGNoLXVwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amid a massive American clean energy shift grid operators play catch-up. • Michigan Advance,"For the better part of the past century the American electric power system evolved around large mostly fossil fuel power plants delivering electricity to residences businesses and industry through a network of transmission and distribution wires that collectively came to be called the electric grid.

But as the threat of climate change driven by carbon pollution becomes more dire and as technological advances make wind solar and battery storage ever cheaper options for powering homes and business states corporations and voters are increasingly pushing to aggressively decarbonize the grid.

Power generation resulted in more than 1.7 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions in 2020 according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration and accounted for about a quarter of all U.S. carbon emissions. Transportation contributes another 27% and policies to speed up electric vehicle adoption including in the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act rely on the electricity needed to charge all those battery-powered cars being produced cleanly.

Thirty states and Washington D.C. have active renewable or clean energy requirements and three other states have voluntary renewable energy goals per the National Conference of State Legislatures. And major corporations — from Amazon Target and Microsoft to Boeing and Google — are also increasingly becoming major green power consumers.

That collective momentum has led to a flood of renewable energy development — thousands of projects billions of dollars in capital and thousands of jobs — but getting that electricity to customers is more complicated than just building solar panels and wind turbines.

Millions of American electric customers are in territories managed by entities called regional transmission organizations or independent system operators which are tasked with managing the flow of electricity across the grid running electric markets ensuring reliability and overseeing new interconnections..

And while grid operators say they’re doing their best to manage the renewable transition while ensuring reliability and keeping costs stable critics contend they’ve been caught flatfooted and are only just now coming to grips with the new demands of a changing power system on their markets and interconnection queues. That’s creating a bottleneck that’s holding up thousands of projects that could help create a cleaner and more resilient grid and tripping up state clean power goals.

Running the grid

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) created standards for regional transmission organizations in a 1999 order in part to spur better regional grid management and more competitive wholesale electric markets.

There are currently seven regional transmission organizations or independent system operators operating in the United States right now. The biggest PJM is one of the largest wholesale electric markets in the world and coordinates the movement of electricity in all or parts of 13 states and Washington D.C. a territory that numbers 65 million people. Roughly two-thirds of American electric customers live in an area where service is managed by a regional transmission organization (RTO) or an independent system operator (ISO) according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

In the West and Southeast customers are generally served by traditional utilities that are typically vertically integrated (meaning they’re responsible for generating transmitting and distributing electricity to their customers) who do their own planning and trade power with each other but not as part of an organized market like in an RTO said Seth Blumsack a professor of energy policy and economics at Penn State.

The differences between an RTO and ISO are largely technical with the FERC setting out specific requirements for RTOs.

“They functionally do the same thing nowadays” said Jeff Dennis managing director and general counsel of Advanced Energy Economy a trade group that represents more than 100 companies working in energy efficiency demand response energy storage solar wind hydro nuclear electric vehicles biofuels and smart grid technologies.

“There are sort of three reasons they matter: markets transmission and reliability” said Casey Roberts a senior attorney with the Sierra Club who focuses on regional transmission organizations. “Those markets and how they’re designed determine what revenue generators earn and how often they run.”

Because they’re charged with managing the grid and ensuring reliability RTOs and ISOs also oversee new connections for power generators. And across the country they’ve been buried in the past several years by an avalanche of interconnection requests mostly from wind and solar and increasingly battery storage developers in part spurred by how cheap those generation sources have become and also as a result of states’ clean energy policies.

“A number of these RTOs have decision systems that were designed for a bygone era of the grid” Blumsack said. “They were sort of designed when your market participants were transmission owners big generation owners utilities. As you have mandates for new technologies and all these new market actors emerging it’s been hard for some RTOs to integrate them.”

The queue blues

The most conspicuous example of that dynamic has been the interconnection queues in which thousands of projects mostly wind and solar languish while waiting for approval to connect to the grid. There’s been little regional and interregional transmission expansion in the past decade said John Moore director of the Natural Resources Defense Council’s Sustainable FERC Project. For example wind energy is abundant in parts of the Midwest and West but it needs long-range transmission lines to get it to population centers that comprise the bulk of the electric load.

“With all of those pressures on the grid it was to some extent predictable but unfortunate that we’re at this point — with a big backlog and delays for renewable projects” Moore said.

Developers also in many cases can’t get good information on the costs of that connection and any associated grid upgrades they’ll be required to pay for prior to application Roberts and other critics say leading to developers filing for multiple projects just to find the best place to site a single solar array for example.

“Usually developers don’t start putting steel in the ground until they have the results of their interconnection study” Roberts said. “Sometimes the interconnection costs can be more than 50% of the project cost.”

Many grid operators have struggled to manage their interconnection queues. For example the Midcontinent Independent System Operator or MISO which encompasses parts or all of 15 states stretching from Minnesota to Louisiana has hundreds of mostly wind and solar projects in its interconnection queue that amounted to a capacity of more than 118000 megawatts as of Sept. 19. However MISO got an interconnection reform plan approved by the FERC earlier this year that is intended to streamline the process.

But nowhere has the problem been more pronounced than within PJM which is headquartered near Philadelphia.

“They exist in many many places in the country” said Dennis of Advanced Energy Economy. “PJM has just been the worst example in recent years.”

As of early September PJM had more than 2500 projects in the queue with a total capacity of more than 22500 megawatts according to Ken Seiler PJM’s vice president of planning. For some perspective that’s more than the maximum output of all the power generation in the PJM region right now (about 185000 MW).

“Here’s the crazy thing about the interconnection backlog that PJM finds themselves in” said Lorig Charkoudian a Democratic member of the Maryland House of Delegates whose district is just outside Washington. “PJM would tell you that what they do what they take pride in is they forecast and they plan. Here we have a situation where you could have absolutely forecast this moment if you wanted to.”

Charkoudian an economist points to examples like PJM rules that have since been overhauled but initially penalized renewable energy sources trying to participate in PJM’s capacity market. She also criticized the grid operator’s previous restrictions on battery storage as hindering Maryland and other states with aggressive plans to decarbonize.

“You knew this moment was coming you had a structure in place that was unworkable.

Forecasting is what you do. Fix it. And fix it 10 years ago” she said.

Reforms to the rescue?

PJM and other RTOs say they are.

“The existing planning queue was designed to process larger centralized generation resources that were far fewer in number” said Seiler the PJM vice president of planning. “It was also not designed to weed out the many speculative projects that may not have the financing or other means necessary to bring the project to completion.”

A new interconnection process developed by a PJM task force starting in 2021 has been filed for approval with the FERC and will shift to a “first-ready first-served basis rather than first come first-served.” The new framework also includes a “cluster” approach to studying interconnection costs reducing the number of additional studies required when projects are modified and streamlining interconnections for projects “that do not contribute to the need for network upgrades.”

“Along with the process revisions PJM studied more projects than all other RTOs combined in 2020 leading to 30000 MW worth of generation completing the study process and having executed final agreements in hand. Despite this only 1500 MW worth of generation has gone commercial in 2022 as developers face additional challenges beyond the interconnection study process” Seiler said.

For some renewable developers environmental advocates and state politicians though it’s an imperfect fix. For one PJM is proposing to freeze its queue for two years to work through the backlog creating delays for projects that haven’t been filed yet. (By comparison MISO is pushing to cut its interconnection application process to about a year without any freeze on new requests.) Going forward PJM envisions processing new interconnection requests within two years.

In comments to the FERC the Organization of PJM States which represents state public service commissions in PJM territory called the reforms a “step in the right direction” and a “considerable improvement to the existing processes which is hindering some states’ ability to achieve their policy goals.”

However while the group encouraged FERC to approve the plan it said it was “deeply concerned that even under PJM’s proposed reforms a project entering the queue today may not be able to achieve commercial operation until nearly 2030.”

‘A potential roadblock’

Aside from the queue problems critics say capacity markets like PJM’s intended to ensure there’s enough available electricity to handle spikes in load are tilted toward fossil fuel generators and allow old inefficient and polluting power plants to limp along rather than be retired as well as charge electric customers for capacity they don’t need.

“In terms of what the role is RTOs are both critically important for the clean energy transition but also without reform of their markets a potential roadblock to the clean energy transition” Dennis said.

RTO markets Dennis said were designed 20 to 25 years ago around the generation of the time primarily coal gas and nuclear power plants.

“The resources that we will rely on in the future have different technical and operating characteristics” he said. “That’s really where we are in a market like PJM. We’re trying to evolve these rules.”

Seiler the PJM vice president said the organization is “committed to a reliable energy transition as cost-effectively and reliably facilitating state decarbonization policies (and other state policies) through our competitive markets operations and planning processes.

“This is at the heart of almost everything we do today.”

‘Steps in the right direction’

For renewable energy developers and advocates though there are signs that RTOs are working better with states to help them meet their goals.

MISO recently approved more than $10 billion for 18 transmission projects comprising more than 2000 miles of transmission line in the upper Midwest including in Michigan Wisconsin Illinois Indiana Iowa Minnesota Missouri and the Dakotas. The plan “represents the most complex transmission study effort in MISO’s history” the grid operator said and will provide a host of benefits for the grid.

“Carbon-free and clean energy goals set by MISO member utilities state and municipal government policies and customer preferences continue to drive growth in wind solar battery and hybrid projects” MISO said. “As the region faces both a changing resource fleet and increased prevalence of extreme weather events the ability to move electricity from where it is generated to where it is needed most becomes paramount.”

PJM also reached a novel deal with the Board of Public Utilities in New Jersey which has set an ambitious goal for offshore wind energy development (7500 megawatts by 2035) that will allow a “first-of-its-kind competitive transmission process” administered by PJM which is expected to drive down costs of getting that wind-generated electricity to customers as long as New Jersey handles the bill within its own borders.

“The provision enables a state or group of states to propose a project to assist in realizing state public policy requirements as long as the state (or states) agrees to pay all costs of any state-selected build-out” PJM said in a news release.

Then there’s what Dennis of Advanced Energy Economy called an “aggressive agenda” by the FERC itself to help smooth the renewable transition for grid operators and developers alike.

A recent FERC order for instance directs RTOs and ISOs to remove barriers to electric market participation for energy storage a crucial technology to balancing the intermittent nature of wind and solar power.

And two other proposed major rules deal with transmission and interconnection respectively.

“Who pays for transmission is one of the biggest barriers to getting transmission built” Dennis said. “FERC is trying to streamline that by determining who the beneficiaries are in a standardized way.” The hope is the change will head off one of the most common objections by states to new transmission — that their residents are paying for it without getting enough benefit Dennis said.

The proposed interconnection rule is aimed squarely at expediting the queue backlogs for connecting new electric generation to the grid.

“At the end of 2021 there were more than 1400 gigawatts of generation and storage waiting in interconnection queues throughout the country. This is more than triple the total volume just five years ago. Projects now face an average timeline of more than three years to get connected to the grid” FERC said in a June news release.

The main components are: A “first-ready first-served” cluster study process in which large interconnection studies encompassing multiple generating facilities rather than individual ones

Imposing firm deadlines and penalties if transmission providers fail to complete studies on time

Allowing multiple generators to share a single interconnection request and co-locate on a shared site.

Better modeling for how “non-synchronous” generating facilities like wind solar and storage will actually perform when they connect to the grid.

“They’re definitely both steps in the right direction” said Roberts the Sierra Club attorney. “It’s really important for FERC to set a baseline for transmission and interconnection that will work better for consumers. “",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL25ld3MuZnN1LmVkdS9uZXdzL3NjaWVuY2UtdGVjaG5vbG9neS8yMDIyLzEwLzA0L2NlbnRlci1mb3ItYWR2YW5jZWQtcG93ZXItc3lzdGVtcy1idWlsZGluZy10b29scy1mb3ItdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS1vZi1lbmVyZ3kv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Center for Advanced Power Systems building tools for the future of energy,"CAPS typically is the workplace for 50 graduate students from the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering and 30 undergraduates each year.

“It’s a win-win situation” said Pamidi who is also the chair of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering. “Companies need help and we have the expertise to help them while training the future workforce.”

This future workforce is trained by 10 tenure-line faculty members of the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering and 25 full-time researchers many of whom also hold appointments at the college. They handle a vast number of projects that span the field of power engineering.

Here are a few examples of current CAPS projects:

Lowering the risks for new electronic hardware

You never quite know what you will encounter when adding a new component to a complicated power system said CAPS senior research faculty member Michael “Mischa” Steurer.

“We often see unexpected outcomes when we test prototypes” he said. “Our goal is to make sure those unexpected outcomes don’t lead to problems.”

Steurer and his team helped pioneer a tool that allows engineers to build a simulation of complicated power systems. They can then add to that simulation the real-life component they want to incorporate in the system and see how everything reacts. This “hardware-in-the-loop” simulation technique lets engineers test new equipment much earlier in the design process before building the rest of the system or tearing out the guts of an existing one. That reduces costs and risks associated with integrating new technology into the electric power grids of the future.

Power and energy systems need to become more agile to handle new and emerging applications such as microgrids that use renewable energy or electric cars ships and airplanes where power loads can change rapidly Steurer said.

“Power systems have to become better at handling dynamic loads” he said. “A microgrid that gets energy from solar power for example will have to handle weather that can change from moment to moment. We’re helping design and test the systems to meet those needs.”

Developing superconducting power devices to move energy more efficiently

Typical electric cables which often use copper or aluminum to conduct current lose energy because of electrical resistance. That is not the case with superconductors.

These engineering marvels show no resistance to electrical current and offer improvements in applications such as electric machines quantum computers and more.

Pamidi’s research group develops superconducting power systems including in applications such as electric planes and ships.

The benefits of an electric plane go beyond adding another option for powering aircraft. Superconducting devices would allow for lighter and more efficient aircraft opening a host of possibilities for sustainable travel with minimal environmental impacts.

Planes using electricity would not have the emissions and noise that conventional planes generate burdens that mostly fall on the neighborhoods around airports. Because they could accelerate quickly planes using electricity could use shorter runways for landing and take-off expanding where they could operate.

Superconductors could help develop all-electric ships. An important consideration for ships is how far they can travel before needing to refuel. Electric ships can expand that range dramatically.

“Electric propulsion gives ships or planes improved capabilities but we need to develop the technology to make those systems work at scale” Pamidi said. “Superconducting cables make it possible to move large amounts of electricity between the sources and loads without taking up too much space or becoming too heavy.”

Modernizing the electric grid

America’s electric grid is evolving to handle more energy from renewable sources such as solar and wind but these sources can’t be turned on at a moment’s notice.

Professor Helen Li is helping with that transition courtesy of a $3.8 million grant from the Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office and a $1.8 million investment from FSU and other partners. Working with colleagues from the City of Tallahassee Northeastern University the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Siemens researchers are developing technology that could help make renewable energy solutions more feasible and thus increase their adoption. The team is developing converters that are smaller and lighter than existing technology and can function at a higher voltage which is crucial for use in the power grid.

They also give grids the ability to quickly and reliably switch between a connection within the wider electric system and a self-contained system. A so-called “microgrid” allows cities to be more resilient to disruptions in an outside power supply. In the case of a hurricane that downs power lines for instance the microgrid could supply power when the larger grid is down.

The controls developed by Li and her team incorporate artificial intelligence which helps power plant managers efficiently use the energy captured by renewable sources. For example AI can tell managers whether energy from solar panels should be used immediately or stored for later use when the sun is down or wind isn’t blowing. The algorithm driving that decision will consider how much energy users need and when it makes financial sense to sell it back to the grid. It also considers how to use storage devices such as batteries so they last longer.

It’s all part of making a grid that’s more adaptable and sustainable.

“The electric grids of the future will need to be designed to handle more renewable energy sources” Li said. “The work we’re doing at CAPS is helping that transition.”

Improving autonomous vehicle technology

Humans make mistakes. Human drivers make plenty of them. Autonomous vehicle technology is a tool that could help drivers reduce the likelihood and impact of errors.

Assistant Professor Olugbenga Moses Anubi is helping develop the next generation of autonomous vehicle technology.

There’s a range of driverless technology. Some of it such as lane assistance or automatic braking is standard in new cars. Other technologies such as a fully autonomous car are still being developed. The work also leads to improvements for things like power systems or pipelines.

In Anubi’s Resilient and Autonomous Systems Lab researchers develop algorithms that autonomous systems can use to navigate a complex environment. Those algorithms are deterministic meaning that particular inputs will lead to the same decision every time. Researchers simulate scenarios over and over when building those algorithms giving them a better chance of catching accidents before they happen.

“In our lab we don’t see a future where all vehicles on the road are going to be fully autonomous” Anubi said. “People are still going to ride bicycles right? Those are not going to be autonomous. There are going to be all kinds of vehicles on the road. We’re not taking humans out of the loop. We’re doing autonomy with humans not autonomy in spite of humans.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd2lzY29uc2luZXhhbWluZXIuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMDUvcmVwb3J0LXNheXMtbWFueS11dGlsaXRpZXMtYXJlLXNsb3ctd2Fsa2luZy1jbGVhbi1lbmVyZ3ktZ29hbHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Report says many utilities are slow-walking clean energy goals • Wisconsin Examiner,"DENVER — A report released this week by the Sierra Club faults dozens of utilities that provide a major chunk of U.S. electric generation for failing to speed up their decarbonization efforts.

“For the sake of our communities and planet we must do everything in our power to create a clean renewable electric grid by 2030” the Sierra’s Club’s “Dirty Truth” report says. “Utilities must lead this transition but our research shows they are wholly unprepared to do their part. Clean energy is reliable and affordable; electric utilities have no excuse to delay and no time left to waste.”

The report released Monday is an update of a 2021 study the group did. The Sierra Club analyzed plans of 77 utilities that collectively supply about 40% of U.S. electric generation and gave out letter grades based on how well utilities many with their own clean energy goals were working to decarbonize.

“Most are still not on the path to achieve 80% clean electricity by 2030. Of the 77 utilities we studied nearly half of them (44%) made no progress or received a lower score than in our previous report” the Sierra Club said. “This disappointing inaction occurred despite a tumultuous 18 months of grid reliability crises blackouts energy price spikes and extreme weather events; many of these trace their roots in large part to utilities’ stubborn reliance on expensive and unreliable fossil fuels.”

To determine the grades the Sierra Club looked at the latest versions of the utilities’ integrated resource plans documents that lay out how they will meet future electric demand evaluating how quickly they intend to retire coal plants and penalizing them for plans that include building new gas generation.

“If a company includes multiple scenarios in their IRP we use the scenario they denote as their preferred scenario” said Cara Bottorff a Sierra Club managing senior analyst. “If they do not denote a preferred scenario we use the scenario that is the worst case for gas (i.e. the one that would add the most gas) to demonstrate the largest amount of gas that the company is considering building.”

Overall 56% of the utilities examined improved their scores 9% made no progress and 35% got worse grades. You can check how your local utility did here.

The Edison Electric Institute an association that represents investor-owned utilities called the metrics “arbitrary” and dismissed the report as a “messaging document.”

“The reality is that existing nuclear generation and the flexibility provided by natural gas generation are what enabled the U.S. electric power industry to deploy 27 gigawatts of new renewables reliably and cost-effectively last year” said Brian Reil an EEI spokesman.

“The emissions reductions goals set by America’s investor-owned electric companies are firmly grounded in our current understanding of technology and economics and they also reflect our responsibility to prioritize customer affordability and reliability.”

Reil noted that more than 40% of U.S. electricity is now generated by carbon-free resources and said electric utilities are investing in new technologies to deliver more.

“If the Sierra Club truly wants to accelerate the deployment of clean energy they should consider joining the other environmental industry and government leaders who are working together constructively to identify ways to overcome the barriers to building the transmission and other clean energy infrastructure we clearly need in order to deliver more resilient clean energy to customers” he said.

At the Experience POWER conference for energy industry professionals Tuesday in Denver the pace of the renewable energy transition was a major theme. Duane Highley the CEO of Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association — a not-for-profit cooperative supplier which operates in New Mexico Colorado Wyoming and Nebraska and includes 42 electric distribution cooperatives and public power districts that provide power to more than a million consumers — used an old George Carlin comedy bit about driving to illustrate the competing tensions on utilities and electric co-ops trying to decarbonize without risking reliability.

Anybody driving slower than you is an idiot Carlin said while anybody going faster is a maniac.

“We’re being pulled between those people who think we are going too fast and those who think we are going too slow” he said noting that two states his coop operates in New Mexico and Colorado are much more green-energy oriented than the other two: Nebraska and Wyoming.

“There’s no map for this” he said. “We’re in uncharted territory.”

He said the ability to generate electricity from fuel oil helped bail out Tri-State during the 2021 winter storm that caused the grid to collapse in Texas resulting in an estimated 246 deaths. That makes it hard for utilities to ditch the reliability benefits of certain kinds of fossil fuel generation as quickly as some would like.

“We can make this happen and it is happening” Highley said. He added that Tri-State which got a B grade on the Sierra Club report is on pace to have 50% of the electricity used by its members come from renewable sources by 2024 thanks to bountiful wind and solar resources with an eventual goal of getting to 80% decarbonization though that will still require some fossil fuel generation to stay in the mix.

“We’re going to clean up the grid and then we’re going to electrify everything” he said.

Wisconsin utilities push back against low scores

Wisconsin’s three largest electric power utilities all rated poorly in the Sierra report. Company representatives pushed back at the findings.

The Sierra Club gave Wisconsin Public Service an F singling out the Green Bay power company for making no progress toward retiring coal-fired power. The report also rated WPS down for its plans to add 66 megawatts of gas-powered generating capacity by 2030 instead of moving toward the elimination of gas as a fuel by then. WPS is 8% of the way toward a goal of replacing existing fossil-fueled generation entirely with clean energy according to the report.

We Energies received a D in the report. The Milwaukee-based utility is 41% of the way toward retiring all coal-fired power by 2030 and 11% of the way to replacing fossil fuel generation with clean energy according to the Sierra Club.

“We strongly disagree with this report that not only ignores the facts but also discounts the importance of the ongoing investments we are making in renewables and keeping the lights on for customers” said Brendan Conway spokesman for We Energies and WPS both part of WEC Energy Group.

Conway said the utilities should be credited for building Wisconsin’s first large-scale solar parks and operating the largest fleet of wind farms in the state. He called the stated intent at WEC Energies to spend $3.5 billion on new renewable energy generation by 2026 and stop using coal by 2035 “some of the most aggressive environmental goals in the industry.”

A Sierra Club press release that said WEC Energy Group had made “no progress” on its clean energy goals in the last year was “factually wrong” in light of new solar projects and groundbreaking on a new solar/battery park and a new wind park he added.

Alliant Energy which operates as Wisconsin Power & Light in Wisconsin was also given a D grade. The report notes that WPL doesn’t plan to add any new gas generation by 2030 — a positive — and that it is 42% of the way toward retiring all coal-burning power generation by then. The utility is 16% of the way toward a goal of 100% clean-energy generation by then.

Responding to the report Alliant spokeswoman Cindy Tomlinson said the utility is in the process of building 12 solar projects in Wisconsin generating a total of 1100 megawatts with two of them now in service two more scheduled to come online before 2023 and the rest scheduled to be operational by the end of 2023.

While the company has delayed its timeline for retiring coal-fired generation in search of greater flexibility in managing its power capacity and to address supply chain problems Tomlinson said Alliant is still on track to complete that process by mid-2026."

But it may have something better for cardmembers — private fares other negotiated deals perks and points redemption.

A majority of American Express’ new customers — 60 percent — in the second quarter belonged to the Generation Z and millennial generations a metric very much noticed at subsidiary American Express Travel.

“Their mindset around culturally impactful travel is helping to shape what we do” Audrey Hendley president of American Express Travel told Skift last week.

American Express Travel the leisure travel business that handles cardmembers’ vacations and pleasure trips became the sixth largest U.S. travel agency in 2021 overtaking Flight Centre and Internova.

That ranking is from Travel Weekly’s 2022 Power List which pegged American Express Travel at $4.9 billion in 2021 sales. This figure was just 71 percent of the travel agency’s 2019 numbers but parent company American Express reported that in April cardmembers’ total travel and entertainment spending including for hotels flights car rentals and cruises as well as restaurants and concerts rose to 108 percent of the 2019 mark. That was the first time travel and entertainment spending through American Express eclipsed pre-pandemic levels.

“We have seen the demand for travel rebound faster and stronger than what we expected” Hendley said.

One signal of that rebound is the recovery of the company’s elongated booking windows which many travel companies saw shrink to a fraction of their pre-pandemic lengths as uncertainty and disruption took their toll.

“We’re seeing advanced bookings being very very strong” Hendley said. “So one of the measures that I look at is 120-plus days out from today. Versus the same time in 2019 those 120-day-plus bookings are up 40 percent for U.S. card members.”

The trip mix has reverted to pre-pandemic levels of 70 percent domestic and 30 percent international she said adding “And that’s kind of back to what we would’ve seen in the past as travel continues to surge.”

American Express Travel and Amex Global Business Travel

Many people confuse American Express Travel the leisure travel agency that’s part of public credit card company American Express with the larger American Express Global Business Travel ($7.1 billion in 2021 sales) which became a public company in its own right in at the end of May.

The two businesses had been part of the same parent company until 2014 when American Express spun out Amex Global Business Travel into a privately held joint venture.

The two companies have a tight relationship and American Express owns 35 percent of Amex Global Business Travel now formally known as Global Business Travel Group. That stake is down from 40 percent before the business travel company’s stock market debut.

Among the tie-ins American Express licenses its brand to the business travel group and American Express and the Global Business Travel Group conduct joint negotiations with airlines hotels and car rental companies to wrangle sometimes-exclusive deals including private airfares as well as significant discounts and perks such as late checkouts or hotel upgrades.

The Value Proposition

Those deals are part of the reason many cardmembers are attracted to American Express Travel which touts its roughly 100 years in the travel industry despite some weaknesses (we’ll discuss further below).

American Express Platinum cardmembers according to American Express Travel “can enjoy exclusive savings on premium class fares on over 20 participating airlines” when booking international trips at AmexTravel.com.

Business Platinum cardmembers who book first and business class seats partially or wholly with points through American Express Travel receive 35 percent of these points back the company said.

Luxury lodging benefits from 2000 hotels around the world include 5x membership rewards points for Platinum cardmembers when they book on AmexTravel.com and they can pay for these stays with points on that portal as well.

“I book all my travel with Amex” said Marcus Baldwin 27 who’s in the tech industry in a Twitter direct message. “I think the hotel prices are compelling and I like the added perks I get from the hotels program (including Fine Hotels + Resorts and The Hotel Collection). “I also think the peace of mind of dealing with a travel company that knows me based on my card membership. I like being able to use points to pay with travel also.”

Baldwin’s one cited disappointment is he would like to see American Express Travel add the ability to book Amtrak tickets.

Allen Walton 34 the founder of FlyGuyTravel and a Richardson Texas resident said in a phone call that he booked around half a dozen hotel stays through American Express Travel over the last year including an upcoming reservation at a Hilton’s Conrad Bangkok in Thailand and he’s generally found the rates “way better” than booking directly with the hotel or Booking.com or even compared to group rates in one instance when he was attending an event.

Travel Agents and Mix of Booking Channels

American Express Travel has around 7000 travel agents or travel consultants in company parlance in 23 countries and the planning and booking experience can be hybrid.

Hendley of American Express Travel said the agency attempts to provide a cross-channel experience so disclosing to this reporter a percentage of online or offline bookings might be misleading and a “disservice” to each.

“So you could go online and you could start your booking there and then you have something a little bit more complicated or something you want to talk about” Hendley said. “And you might then say forget that. I’m going to call you on the phone. You might start on the phone and you might say you know what? I need to look around and see what other hotels are in the location and you go back to the online.”

Walton the Texas entrepreneur said he booked a stay using the American Express Platinum card’s concierge service but reserved the wrong dates. In trying to modify the booking he said the customer service was “not great” because the concierge service agent told him she couldn’t cancel an American Express Travel booking and redirected Walton back to the travel agency’s non-Platinum cardmember customer service.

On the other hand Danielle Nuzzo 38 a communications professional at Trust & Will in San Diego California raved in a Twitter direct message about her experience booking her honeymoon including using Amex points for the flights through American Express Travel six years ago.

“They had a lot of knowledge of specific hotels and villas to book in Sri Lanka and the Maldives” Nuzzo said. “They were super helpful on which hotel and even the villa number to book in the Maldives for the best sunset view.”

Nuzzo’s American Express travel consultant even came to the rescue with a visa on short notice.

“Well one thing that was overlooked was a tourist visa which was needed for Sri Lanka” Nuzzo said. “So the day before our flight while in Dubai we realized we don’t have a visa but once we contacted our agent she was able to get it sorted out very quickly and we were on the flight the next day. “

Nuzzo said the couple communicated with the American Express Travel agent for the honeymoon trip “mostly by phone and email communication.”

“I’m wondering if they have an app now that you could direct-message your agent for quicker responses?” asked Nuzzo who counts herself solidly as a millennial.

If there are some gripes at times about American Express Travel’s customer service it should be pointed out that American Express took top honors for customer satisfaction in the J.D. Power 2022 U.S. Credit Card Satisfaction Study for the third year in a row.

There Are Millennials and Then There Are Other Millennials

Nuzzo’s reference to whether American Express Travel has a mobile app raises the issue of how American Express Travel relates to younger travelers.

American Express Travel doesn’t have a dedicated mobile app and when cardmembers seek to book travel in the American Express app they get pushed to an American Express Travel mobile website.

American Express Travel’s Hendley said the company’s customers — and not just the ones who skew younger — seek experiential travel — and during the second quarter 60 percent of American Express’ new customers in the U.S. were Generation Z or millennials.

Hendley said American Express Travel found that 81 percent of its customers expressed the sentiment that it was “very important” that they feel like they are contributing to local economies when they travel.

“And this is very meaningful to people and it’s not just what you would think in terms of millennials” she said. “It’s across the board in terms of what customers want. They want to be in local places they don’t want the one size fits all.”

American Express Travel doesn’t have a great mobile experience and it doesn’t offer short-term rentals during an era where many people are looking to travel work and live in new places beyond hotels. Hendley pointed out that its Fine Hotels + Resorts program offers “a lot of properties that have onsite villas and properties that have multiple bedrooms and kitchens in different destinations.”

If American Express Travel indeed wants to appeal to customers in the current era after the pandemic reshaped the travel environment doesn’t it need to offer more vacation rentals at a minimum?

Calling it “an interesting trend” Hendley said the company knows a lot of customers are interested in short-term rentals.

“We’re watching the ways people are traveling and I just want to make sure that if we ever did that that we made sure that we were innovating and being very differentiated in the marketplace” Hendley said.

It would be easy to envision an American Express Travel partnership with Homes & Villas by Marriott International which deals in higher-end vacation rentals or Amex could find another collaborator. American Express currently offers co-branded credit cards with Marriott Hilton and Delta Air Lines.

Jordan Stolper 44 an entrepreneur who lives in Denver Colorado uses his Amex Platinum Card for travel and American Express Travel solely for the cardmember benefits including 5x points and perks like free breakfasts.

In terms of appealing to younger travelers Stolper said in a phone interview that American Express Travel has “no decent mobile experience” which would be a short-coming for travelers who live with their phones at the ready 24/7. But he cautioned that short-term rentals aren’t necessarily a make-or-break feature.

Millennials and Generation Z are “not a market segment — it’s an age range” Stolper said. “Not all millennials shop and think alike. Not all millennials want to stay in Airbnbs.”

So Gen Z and millennial travelers booking business class seats on Delta through American Express or using their Amex Platinum cards to earn 5x rewards are not necessarily the same ones scrolling for deals or watering plants to earn rewards in the Hopper app or scouring comparison shopping websites like Google Travel or Skyscanner to find hotel bargains.

Who Powers What

Stolper who co-founded a travel startup more than a decade ago disparaged the look and feel of American Express Travel and characterized it as “an overlay on Expedia.”

Indeed Expedia provides the backend foundation for American Express Travel’s air hotel car and tour verticals while Arrivia does cruise.

American Express Travel in tandem with Amex Global Business Travel negotiates the deals in its airline and hotel programs. And American Express tweaks the front end user experience beyond what its booking engine partners provide.

More Banks Launching Travel Portals

A flurry of financial institutions including Capital One with Hopper; Chase with the acquisition of Frosch and Citi with Booking.com are newly operating revamping or launching travel businesses.

Is this a challenge to American Express Travel?

Hendley characterized banks getting into travel as a positive trend. “It kind of buoys us and gives us confidence in what we are doing” she said and referenced more than 2000 properties in Fine Hotels + Resorts its global network of airlines and cruise partners tours and land-based vacations as well as 1400 lounges in some 140 countries.

“For us we feel like we’ve got a very strong value proposition and we’ve got a strong infrastructure” Hendley said. “We continue to invest and we continue to get to know our customers with every trip and iterate and develop from there.”

Several Additional Points

When it comes to points redemption an article in The Points Guy last year argued that there can be more value in transferring Amex rewards points to airline and hotel loyalty programs than redeeming them on AmexTravel.com.

“While you can use your points to book hotels and flights in the Amex Travel Portal you’ll typically get more value from your American Express Membership Rewards points by transferring them to airline and hotel partners instead” the article said. “There are exceptions to this such as the case of last-minute travel when there is no award availability available.”

Hendley said she wasn’t familiar with the article adding “it’s very hard to say yes or no to that.”

The American Express Travel president didn’t directly answer the points redemption question and focused instead on what her travel agency offers in service.

When you find out from your airline that it changed your flight and your American Express Travel team took care of everything “so I don’t know is that more points or less points than what you would have received if you went to the airline directly” Hendley said.

“In this case I would probably venture you’re getting better value in American Express because their [the airline’s] value proposition is around the fares” and American Express Travel is providing so much more she said. “So that’s why it’s hard to do a straight line comparison.”

There’s another part of American Express Travel’s infrastructure that Hendley frequently mentions — the company’s 7000 travel consultants.

With plenty of holiday travel looming Hendley said the travel industry has made huge commitments to decreasing the disruption that made summer travel so difficult for many.

“We say this to customers all the time: You always have to have plan B” Hendley said. “What happens if … and that’s of course where your traveling comes in. Your travel consultant is there to help you with the plan B because things don’t go to plan. So let’s have a plan when it doesn’t go to plan.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2FtZXJpY2FuLWV4cHJlc3MtZW5kcy1jb3ZpZC12YWNjaW5lLXJlcXVpcmVtZW50cy13b3JraW5nLW9mZmljZS0yMDIyLTEwLTA1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Express ends COVID vaccine requirements for working from office,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2FtZXJpY2FuLWV4cHJlc3MtZW5kcy1jb3ZpZC12YWNjaW5lLXJlcXVpcmVtZW50cy13b3JraW5nLW9mZmljZS0yMDIyLTEwLTA1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC7D71540>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2FtZXJpY2FuLWV4cHJlc3MtZW5kcy1jb3ZpZC12YWNjaW5lLXJlcXVpcmVtZW50cy13b3JraW5nLW9mZmljZS0yMDIyLTEwLTA1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL25ldy15b3JrLzIwMjIvMTAvMDQvYW1lcmljYW4tZXhwcmVzcy10by1leHBsb3JlLWhlYWRxdWFydGVycy1zYWxlLW1vdmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Express Hires Cushman & Wakefield for Office Options,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL25ldy15b3JrLzIwMjIvMTAvMDQvYW1lcmljYW4tZXhwcmVzcy10by1leHBsb3JlLWhlYWRxdWFydGVycy1zYWxlLW1vdmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC7D73FD0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL25ldy15b3JrLzIwMjIvMTAvMDQvYW1lcmljYW4tZXhwcmVzcy10by1leHBsb3JlLWhlYWRxdWFydGVycy1zYWxlLW1vdmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWVyaWNhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2VuLXVzL2J1c2luZXNzL3RyZW5kcy1hbmQtaW5zaWdodHMvYXJ0aWNsZXMvYXJlLWdyZWF0LWJlbmVmaXRzLWF0dHJhY3RpbmctYW5kLXJldGFpbmluZy10b3AtdGFsZW50LXJpZ2h0LW5vdy0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are Great Benefits Attracting and Retaining Top Talent Right Now?,"It was late 2021 and Betsy Goldberg was sitting in her Seattle home looking online for a new career opportunity when she happened upon a director of communications role at AI-focused Shelf Engine. The posting grabbed her right away.

“I remember seeing the first words of the job description read something like ‘At Shelf Engine our mission is to reduce food waste through automation’” she says. “That mission made me perk up and after clicking into the description I realized my skills were a match and the benefits were very attractive.”

The benefits were unlimited PTO full coverage of employee premiums for medical/dental/vision one free lunch per week one free happy hour per week a remote work option and pre-IPO stock options just to name a few. Goldberg submitted her resume landed the job and is thrilled with her decision.

But are benefits what have kept her at Shelf Engine? “I think benefits are important as a baseline but right now people are looking for more than that” she says.

Goldberg is passionate about Shelf Engine’s mission to use AI to reduce food waste at grocery stores; in fact she says it is one of the biggest reasons she took the job.

“The definition of what employees are looking for today has expanded greatly” she says. “Yes job titles salaries benefits are still important. But people want to be happy at work and want a mission they are contributing to. They want to feel valued and important. I think employees can write their own ticket right now especially with how the market is.”

A little more than 800 miles south in Oakland California Ioana Ellis serves as the interim chief human resources officer (CHRO) at fintech card issuing company Marqueta and is seeing some startling trends in attracting and retaining talent.

“Since the onset of the pandemic” says Ellis ""there’s no playbook for what’s happening from the perspective of HR and company leaders. It is all new.”

From a benefits standpoint Ellis is seeing an increased focus on supporting employee health and wellbeing. This also includes expanding the definition of an employee’s family to offer more inclusive coverage of loved ones and those an employee may be caring for.

One-size-fits-all benefits no longer work. [...] Start looking at which benefits are being used to understand common denominators.

—Ioana Ellis interim chief human resources officer Marqueta

Additionally the need for financial literacy has gone up since the onset of the pandemic she says noting that many current employees haven’t experienced an economic downturn. She sees an opening for companies to help staffers understand how to manage their money as part of an overall hiring package.

So what are the things that will help your company stand out when hiring and retaining top employees?

Here are a couple suggestions that may help.

Customize Your Benefits

This doesn’t have to mean different benefits for each of your staffers. Instead Ellis suggests looking at benefits usage and tailoring future perks to those numbers. “One-size-fits-all benefits no longer work” she says. “Start looking at which benefits are being used to understand common denominators.”

Business owners can do this by looking at benefits numbers with a benefits administrator sending out surveys to employees and scheduling one-on-one conversations with employees a few times per year to get a read on their preferences.

G2i a marketplace for software developers has tailored its benefits based on employee feedback. In late 2021 the company tried offering a four-day workweek (32 hours) every other week. Within a few months productivity was so high that management decided to make it a permanent policy upping the frequency to weekly.

This benefit was a strong attractor to Maebellyne Ventura who earlier this year was looking for a job. She soon landed the role as G2i’s director of growth marketing and says the abbreviated week has been a positive experience.

“It’s a 32-hour week for full-time pay; we aren’t working 10-hour days to make up for the day off” she says. “We stick to that timeline through ruthless prioritization of tasks. We set our goals quarterly and create what we call ‘hell yeah’ objectives. Each person has one. And we have to be realistic. It puts everything into perspective.”

Focus on Your Mission and Culture

Like Goldberg top employees are attracted to companies that live their missions and promote positive and inclusive cultures. As a business owner if you’re concerned that you don’t have the funds to create those two things Goldberg urges you to think again.

“A strong culture and mission that unites everyone is very powerful and it doesn’t have to cost money” she says. “If your company is involved with a community organization for example give time off to volunteer.”

She recommends spelling out your company mission on the top of your careers page to attract those aligned with your values. Doing so can create a common purpose that helps staffers feel more connected.

Not sure how to create a positive culture? One idea is to give employees permission to go after the types of projects that are most exciting to them Goldberg advises. Many she says will feel like they are contributing at a higher level and with more influence than if they were in a large corporation—a big perk to a small business setting.

“The bottom line” she says “is to remember that employees are a huge reason for the success of any company. Show how much you appreciate them. It will pay off.”

A sudden uptick of violence in March caused by the breakdown of talks between the government and criminal gangs has sparked a ruthless six-month law enforcement campaign in El Salvador anchored in unprecedented mass arrests and restriction of legal rights. Why does it matter? Fed up with gang violence most Salvadorans have applauded the crackdown. But it has also drawn criticism from human rights organisations and could boomerang. Having more than doubled the prison population the country is headed for a humanitarian crisis in its jails while gangs though now in disarray could strike back. What should be done? Rather than commit to strong-arm tactics for the long term the government should provide an off-ramp for the thousands of gang members willing to build new lives in law-abiding society. The country’s main foreign partners should support these efforts and revive their cooperation with San Salvador.

Executive Summary

To a chorus of popular support El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele has embarked on the largest dragnet of suspected gang members ever seen in Central America. Under a “state of exception” declared in March the government has lengthened the period of detention without charge and lowered the age of prosecution to twelve. Police and troops have mounted checkpoints around and raids on poor districts overrun by gangs. Some 53000 alleged criminals have been jailed on the basis of often dubious proof many in overcrowded unhygienic and dangerous conditions. The prison population now stands proportionally as the world’s highest prompting authorities to break ground for a massive new facility. But although murder rates are touching new lows with many gang members either jailed or on the run the draconian policy raises other concerns that require attention. Gangs could regroup to retaliate while a humanitarian and human rights crisis festers in the country’s jails. For the country’s long-term benefit authorities should develop a way for gang members to return to society as law-abiding citizens. The crackdown’s severity is all the more startling in light of Bukele’s reported overtures to the criminal gangs that have tormented El Salvador for over two decades. Elected in 2019 as an outsider intent on supplanting a discredited two-party system the extroverted young president boosted public services in places plagued by poverty and violence where gangs find many of their recruits. According to media reports and first-hand testimony gathered by Crisis Group his government also entered discreet talks with jailed and free gang leaders spurring a steep reduction in homicide rates. In return the authorities reportedly granted these leaders a number of concessions including expedited release for some of them. During this period the police and military reported fewer clashes with gangs and arrests of their members. A shocking killing spree late in March including the murder of 62 people on one day – the bloodiest 24 hours in recent Salvadoran history – provided the backdrop for Bukele’s abrupt change of tack. Yet even before this flare-up there were reasons to doubt the government’s commitment to a negotiated demobilisation of gangs. The president has always denied that talks with gangs were happening suggesting that negotiation was unlikely to be a pathway to a permanent settlement. As soon as his party won an absolute majority of seats in the legislature in 2021 elections he worked with deputies to bury any evidence of talks by replacing the attorney general and shelving his predecessor’s investigation into the reported negotiations. The MS-13 gang has suggested it carried out the March killings because it felt betrayed by the government’s disavowal of the previous engagement hinting that the president’s interest even in secretive talks had waned by then.

Bukele’s government has turned to heavy-handed tactics to respond to surges of gang violence in the past but none compares to the present crackdown.

Bukele’s government has turned to heavy-handed tactics to respond to surges of gang violence in the past but none compares to the present crackdown in either intensity or duration. With public support for the state of exception sky-high Bukele seems convinced he is sounding the death knell for the country’s three main gangs. He fiercely rejects criticism of his methods. But there are grounds for wondering whether Bukele will succeed. Although murder rates have reached historical lows clashes between gangs and security personnel are on the rise. Gangs have leaked statements threatening to hit back harder if the government does not return to dialogue. The campaign to arrest anyone who has has had or may have had a link with gangs could force former members back into crime if they see no hope of anything else. Mass arrests of former gang members who have converted to Christianity in order to quit gang life are troubling. Dire overcrowding combined with the government’s refusal to take responsibility for what has gone wrong – from custodial deaths to wrongful arrests – could fuel tensions in jails leading to mutinies and escapes. El Salvador’s experience in 2015 after its gang truce broke down when the murder rate rose to the world’s highest hints at the risks that may lie ahead. Adverse financial conditions the threat of debt default and strained ties with the West make it all the more vital that Bukele shift to a security policy that is resilient durable and internationally reputable. El Salvador needs a more humane and sustainable approach to solving its gang problem. A crucial plank of such a policy would be the creation of a clear pathway out of gang life for jailed and free members. Even as they seek to profit politically from fighting crime Bukele and his senior officials should be mindful of the innate dangers of a huge prison population which must be fed and housed and begin looking for ways to release jailed suspects and convicts subject to their monitored participation in rehabilitation programs. Various bills to create a national rehabilitation scheme have been tabled in the country’s Legislative Assembly over recent years but none has prospered; these should be revived. A rehabilitation and reintegration initiative should include measures that promote employment for former gang members with support from churches and civil society. To help communities accept the gang members who may come to live among them San Salvador should also promote restorative justice for victims of violence. Support from large donors including the U.S. and European Union will likely be key to making this initiative a reality. Bukele has so far shown little interest in slowing his pursuit of gangs’ unconditional surrender. But the humanitarian and reputational costs as well as the risks of a return to extremes of lethal violence make it imperative that the government prepare an alternative way out for the jailed population. Force may put the gangs on the run for a period of time but it will take much more to begin dismantling them for good. Guatemala City/Bogotá/Washington/Brussels 5 October 2022

Although the government has retained extraordinary popularity … the country’s overall outlook is tinged with uncertainty.

II. From Security Miracle to State of Exception

Before March 2022 when the MS-13 went on a rampage and Bukele cracked down El Salvador’s public debate was focused more on the president’s anti-democratic steps to consolidate power than gang violence. Rates of violence had plummeted to historical lows with the exception of a few sporadic series of murders. Then a single weekend of unprecedented violence triggered a radical change prompting a ruthless government response centred on mass detentions and the suspension of rights.

IV. Paving a Way Out

Notwithstanding its popularity the present iron-fist policy is not a promising long-term solution to El Salvador’s struggle with gang violence. Creating what could become a permanent humanitarian and human rights crisis in the nation’s jails will be costly in both financial and reputational terms and efforts to force a sudden collapse of the gangs may provide only a fleeting respite if the gangs regroup and mount a backlash as they have in the past. Much as its instincts seem to be telling it to stay the course the government should reconsider its tactics. While law enforcement will no doubt continue to feature prominently in addressing gang-related crime and violence the state needs to ensure higher standards of proof are used against suspects and develop other more sustainable tools. Rather than doubling down on its draconian methods Bukele’s administration should – with donor encouragement – make a major investment in efforts to support the rehabilitation and reintegration of those who wish to rejoin civic life.

A. An Alternative to Jail

Local experts who study the gangs believe that some form of simple offer-acceptance arrangement might be constructed to appeal to at least some members.

But even if a fully negotiated settlement seems far-fetched local experts who study the gangs believe that some form of simple offer-acceptance arrangement might be constructed to appeal to at least some members. For example one expert told Crisis Group that Bukele might be able to take advantage of the gang leaders’ battered authority among the rank and file by declaring the gangs defeated and offering a form of conditional mercy; he might offer reduced sentences for individuals who are imprisoned on the basis of gang membership but have not been convicted of or charged with the most serious crimes.[1] The individuals who agree to participate would upon serving their adjusted time behind bars be allowed to return to civilian life so long as they remain law-abiding and participate in rehabilitation and reintegration programming. For this idea to work authorities would probably need to amend or provide an exemption to criminal code provisions that treat simple gang membership as an offence warranting at least twenty years in jail.[2] To make this approach palatable to the public the president would need to present it “as a surrender of the gangs” an expert stressed.[3] The gangs would of course be loath to accept an offer couched in the language of surrender but at least some in their number could view the alternative of permanent confrontation and mass arrests as even less appealing.[4] While falling far short of genuine negotiations and doing little at first to curtail the conditions generating El Salvador’s cycles of violence an approach along these lines could at least staunch the humanitarian harm jail overcrowding and security risks facing the country over the short-to-medium term. Although it would continue to pursue those who do not abandon gang activity the government should also commit to apply far higher standards of proof when deciding which cases to take to trial. Of course if Bukele were to capitalise on his position of strength to pursue discussions with gang leaders in and outside jails who are inclined to enter talks he could develop the terms of a deal along the foregoing lines while helping ensure greater buy-in from gangs and thus reducing the risks of reprisal against those who commit to rehabilitation. Bukele might require additional authority in order to cut sentences in this manner. As his party is so strong in parliament the legislature would doubtless follow his lead in providing it. Of the 63000 people the police arrested between 1 January and 31 August 2022 over 42000 people were charged for “illicit association” and another 8000 for being part of “terrorist organisations”. That is to say the vast majority of arrests have to do with suspicion of gang membership rather than connection to a specific crime.

B. Elements of a Rehabilitation and Reintegration Policy

Programming designed for jails … will be crucial to designing an effective rehabilitation and reintegration process.

Programming designed for jails the epicentre of the gang problem will be crucial to designing an effective rehabilitation and reintegration process. Most of the old-guard gang leaders are behind bars and members on the outside often continue to comply with their directives the erosion of their authority notwithstanding.[1] But prisons are also the places where loyalty to gangs is at its weakest. Six of ten jailed gang members interviewed for a recent study expressed a wish to leave the groups.[2] That said programming should also create opportunities for gang members who remain at large should they meet eligibility requirements (including that they have no charges pending against them) to participate.[3] The state’s measures curbing communication between jailed gang members and people on the outside have weakened the old guard’s writ.

C. External Backing

Although relations between El Salvador and its foreign partners are at a low ebb renewed collaboration around gang rehabilitation could help rebuild a modicum of trust. The U.S. has traditionally provided important if controversial support to Salvadoran governments in security matters.[1] It has trained police in tactics and criminal investigation supplied equipment and encouraged prison reform placing greater importance of late on prevention and rehabilitation although as noted it has now diverted support for judicial and security institutions to civil society.[2] The incoming U.S. ambassador William Duncan may have the opportunity to revamp bilateral relations by offering support to rehabilitation and reintegration amid the state of exception.[3] U.S. officials should signal to Bukele their willingness to provide robust support for such a program should certain conditions be met – including a rollback of the state of exception and an agreement to keep the program separate from the territorial control plan that Bukele has managed with little transparency.[4] To increase the odds of success Washington may wish to keep its pressure with respect to El Salvador’s democratic decline and the humanitarian crisis in its prisons out of the public eye for the time being. Foreign backing will need to be as broad as possible with the U.S. Canada and the EU all pulling in the same direction. Such coordination has met with success in the past for example when this trio was able to halt approval of a foreign agents law that posed a major threat to civil society groups.[5] U.S. assistance has focused on strengthening law enforcement. Unlike the EU it never showed its support for the 2012 truce. Crisis Group telephone interview truce facilitator 8 March 2022.

The U.S. should … consider whether the sanctions it has applied to senior Salvadoran officials are having the intended effect or whether they might usefully be revisited.

The U.S. should also consider whether the sanctions it has applied to senior Salvadoran officials are having the intended effect or whether they might usefully be revisited. For example a U.S. agency representative complained that sanctions against the heads of El Salvador’s prison system and the Unit for the Reconstruction of the Social Fabric forced colleagues on the ground to bypass those individuals in order to keep working with the institutions they were leading.[1] But these individuals had played a constructive role as interlocutors with the gangs in the past and they could do so again in the future. Whether as a matter of law or policy a sanctions regime that impedes U.S. officials’ capacity to deal with them could be counterproductive to the extent that the U.S. wishes to encourage some form of negotiations to forge a way out of the status quo.[2] Finally the World Bank suggests that in order to build a bridge between rehabilitation work in prisons and a return to productive employment in communities reintegration strategies should be embedded in broader discussions about El Salvador’s economic development. “Job growth in key emerging markets a change in private and public sector hiring practices and the inclusion of re-entry targets … will ensure that” the Bank concludes.[3] Crisis Group interview U.S. agency representative San Salvador 23 March 2022. U.S. diplomats have seemingly begun to reconsider their longstanding reluctance to back government dialogue and engagement with gangs aside from funding pilot projects for gang member rehabilitation. Diplomatic overtures from Washington suggest that it could support gang rehabilitation. It may even agree to back a government program that draws on the consent and cooperation of gang leaders. But for negotiations with gangs to be “acceptable” said a U.S. diplomat “they need to be transparent and not everything with this government is transparent”.

V. Conclusion

A horrific spike in gang violence amid the collapse of secretive dealings between government and gangs in El Salvador has paved the way for a law enforcement offensive marked by punitive zeal and the suspension of basic rights. Instead of simply pursuing those responsible for the killing spree in March the government has used a state of exception to clamp down ruthlessly not just on gang members but people with past or even no links to gangs. Along the way it has created the conditions for a humanitarian crisis in the nation’s overcrowded jails. The government’s heavy-handed campaign based on raids checkpoints and mass arrests appears to have dealt a blow to the gangs who have beat a retreat and is certainly popular among Salvadorans and some regional observers but it is unlikely to yield long-term change in the conditions that generate gang violence. The risks are also significant. Beyond the financial humanitarian and reputational costs of more than doubling the prison population the campaign could generate resentment and perhaps backlash from gang members who see no way back into law-abiding society. Against this backdrop it is almost hard to recall that right after he was elected Bukele’s proposals in the security realm focused on the need to reduce overcrowding in prisons and treat the socio-economic ills that make gangs attractive to Salvadoran teenagers. While now appearing wedded to iron-fist policing President Bukele still has an opportunity to move on to a new path by offering a formal way out of gang membership for the thousands of people who having paid for their crimes express genuine interest in building new lives. A structured transparent process offering rehabilitation to qualifying jailed and free gang members in cooperation with churches civil society and business could also present a chance to improve parlous relations between El Salvador and the country’s main foreign partners which could be in a position to play an important role in unlocking funds that the government desperately needs. The political landscape in the country makes this prospect seem forbiddingly remote. Bukele’s government appears fixated on broadcasting the achievements of its crackdown on “terrorists” as it plots the path to what it hopes will be another sweeping victory in the 2024 presidential legislative and municipal elections. It hardly seems keen on giving gang members a second chance let alone resuming talks with their leaders. Yet the causes of El Salvador’s long struggle with violent crime have not gone away and could deepen should gang members resign themselves to staying on the margins of society while ordinary citizens grow more embittered and the country more isolated. The short-term electoral calculus may point in the direction of tightening the screws on the gangs but El Salvador’s recent history suggests that the benefits of mass arrests are short-lived. The best way to weaken the gangs is to provide members with a way out – not to throw them all in jail. Guatemala City/Bogotá/Washington/Brussels 5 October 2022

Generation X – those born from 1965 to 1980 – spent the most money last year with average expenditure of $83357.

The biggest expense for all age groups is housing accounting for more than 30% of annual spending.

How Americans Spend Their Money By Generation

In 2021 the average American spent just over $60000 a year. But where does all their money go? Unsurprisingly spending habits vary wildly depending on age.

This graphic by Preethi Lodha uses data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to show how average Americans spend their money and how annual expenses vary across generations.

A Generational Breakdown of Overall Spending

Overall in 2021 Gen X (anyone born from 1965 to 1980) spent the most money of any U.S. generation with an average annual expenditure of $83357 .

The second biggest spenders are Millennials with an average annual expenditure of $69061. Image: Visual Capitalist.

Gen X has been nicknamed the “sandwich generation” because many members of this age group are financially supporting both their aging parents as well as children of their own.

The second biggest spenders are Millennials with an average annual expenditure of $69061. Just like Gen X this generation’s top three spending categories are housing healthcare and personal insurance.

On the opposite end of the spectrum members of Generation Z are the lowest spenders with an average of $41636. per year. Their spending habits are expected to ramp up especially considering that in 2022 the oldest Gen Zers are just 25 and still early in their careers.

Similarities Across Generations

While spending habits vary depending on the age group there are some categories that remain fairly consistent across the board.

One of the most consistent spending categories is housing—it’s by the far the biggest expense for all age groups accounting for more than 30% of total annual spending for every generation.

While spending habits vary depending on the age group housing is one of the most consistent spending categories. Image: Visual Capitalist.

Another spending category that’s surprisingly consistent across every generation is entertainment. All generations spent more than 4% of their total expenditures on entertainment but none dedicated more than 5.6%.

All generations spent more than 4% of their total expenditures on entertainment. Image: Visual Capitalist.

Gen Zers spent the least on entertainment which could boil down to the types of entertainment this generation typically enjoys. For instance a study found that 51% of respondents aged 13-19 watch videos on Instagram on a weekly basis while only 15% watch cable TV.

Differences Across Generations

One category that varies the most between generations and relative needs is spending on healthcare.

As the table below shows the Silent Generation spent an average of $7053 on healthcare or 15.8% of their total average spend. Comparatively Gen Z only spent $1354 on average or 3.3% of their total average spend.

Gen Z only spent $1354 on average on healthcare. Image: Visual Capitalist.

However while the younger generations typically spend less on healthcare they’re also less likely to be insured—so those who do get sick could be left with a hefty bill.

A place takes on meaning for people when they become attached to it. The sights sounds and smells make a powerful imprint on our memories; they help us connect to an area. We develop a sense of place based on our experiences and the shared culture and folklore associated with those experiences. Many residents of the Black Hills region identify with the Tower because of the sense of place that has been cultivated by using the land as a gathering spot for many generations.

A Summer Tradition

Modern gatherings at the Tower can be traced back to 4 July 1893 when William Rogers and Willard Ripley promoted their climb to the summit of Devils Tower. Although people continued to use the Tower as a gathering place every summer it was not until 1932 that a local group officially organized the Old Settlers' Picnic. The event would draw thousands of people and offered locals a chance to see their family friends and neighbors.

These Old Settlers' Picnics typically occurred during the month of June and continued into the 1960s. The tradition was revived for the monument's centennial in 2006. Today the Devils Tower Natural History Association hosts the annual event; highlights include guest speakers poetry music food and family fun. The Old Settlers' Picnic typically happens during the last weekend of June.

The operator has asked for softer terms over payments to Indus.

Indus Towers has warned Vodafone Idea (Vi) to 'pay its dues' or risk losing access to its towers from November.

ET reports that sources close to the matter said Indus sent a strongly-worded letter to the operator that warned of potential disruption if payments aren't made. It followed a board meeting that analyzed the company's mounting trade receivables which are largely down to delays in payment from Vi.

Vi has over 255 million subscribers in the country so losing access to towers could severely hit the mobile network operator. Earlier this year the Indian government acquired a 35.8 percent stake in Vodafone Idea to prevent the telco from going under.

""Independent directors on the Indus board were upset about the prolonged non-payment of dues by Vi"" said one of the sources to the ET.

It's estimated that Vi owes dues upwards of ₹10000 crore ($1.2 billion) with ₹7000 crore of this to Indus with the rest of the balance to American Tower.

Indus which operates over 186000 towers in India is reported to have seen a 66.3 percent year-on-year (YoY) fall in net profit to Rs 477.3 crore ($58.5 million) in its June quarter with heavy receivables mainly to blame.

ET reports that the letter further tells Vi to pay 80 percent of its current dues immediately and pay them fully on time 'going forward' or access to the tower network would be barred.

Vi has asked for softer terms over repayments while noting in a statement that the operator is in discussions with Indus Towers over these terms.

""We wish to inform that Indus Towers is one of the large vendors who provide passive infrastructure services to the company…the company has been in discussion with Indus for softer payment terms which are continuing but have not been concluded as yet” said a Vi statement last week.

Vi is one of Indus' main customers and has a 21 percent holding in the tower company but has looked to sell its remaining stakes to raise money. The operator has already sold 7.1 percent of Indus with 2.4 percent sold through a book build offering and 4.7 percent to telco Bharti Airtel which is the largest shareholder of the tower unit."

DAVENPORT Iowa — Iowa American Water has begun construction on its newest building.

Located on Research Parkway in Davenport the 41000-square-foot facility will help the company accommodate its rapid growth.

""We're currently in a 20000 square foot facility we've literally outgrown it to the point to where we're having to convert closets into offices parking spaces are just not existing where we are"" CEO of Iowa American Water Randy Moore said.

The new facility will be able to host all of Iowa American Water's team under one roof while creating multi-use training rooms for new and current employees.

The water company is teaming up with Bush Construction for the project which is expected to be complete by next summer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vaW93YWNhcGl0YWxkaXNwYXRjaC5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8wNC9mb3JldmVyLWNoZW1pY2Fscy1hZ2Fpbi1kZXRlY3RlZC1pbi1taXNzaXNzaXBwaS1yaXZlci10b3ducy13YXRlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Forever chemicals' again detected in Mississippi River towns' water • Iowa Capital Dispatch,"The treated drinking water of Burlington and Davenport are again contaminated by cancer-causing chemicals that persist indefinitely in the environment according to quarterly tests of the water.

Those cities draw most of their water from the Mississippi River. In January state tests revealed the river was contaminated by perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances — commonly known as PFAS or “forever chemicals.”

But tests of the water in June found no contamination. The Iowa American Water Company which supplies water for Davenport has been sampling the river water since 2017 and the results have varied. Sometimes there is PFAS; sometimes there is not. There has been no decipherable pattern the company has said.

The precise source of contamination is unclear but there are known contaminated sites upstream operated by 3M a major manufacturer of the chemicals.

The Iowa Department of Natural Resources has been sampling water since last year to determine the prevalence of PFAS in community water supplies. It has found them in more than a dozen.

This year the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lowered its safety thresholds for the two most-studied PFAS — which say that even miniscule amounts of the chemicals can be hazardous — and set new health advisories for others.

Some cities have stopped using contaminated wells to cut the PFAS in their treated water. West Des Moines was able to reduce its contamination to undetectable levels. Burlington and Davenport are at the whim of the Mississippi River. Davenport draws all of its water from the river. For Burlington it represents about 85% of its total water supply.

Keokuk which is downstream of those cities also gets its water from the river. Its water had the chemicals in January but a test in July did not detect the two prominent PFAS. The Burlington and Davenport tests that did detect the PFAS were in August according to DNR records.

The water supplies with the worst contaminations include Central City in northeast Iowa and the Kammerer Mobile Home Park near Muscatine. Kammerer had about 8000 times the safe amount of one of the PFAS in June. Central City had about 2200 times the safe amount of another.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rb3N1Lm9yZy9lbmVyZ3ktZW52aXJvbm1lbnQvMjAyMi0xMC0wNS9hZnRlci1hLW1vbnRoLW9mLXllbGxvdy1kcmlua2luZy13YXRlci1hbHR1cy1vZmZpY2lhbHMtc2F5LXRoZXl2ZS1hZGRyZXNzZWQtaGlnaC1tYW5nYW5lc2UtY29uY2VudHJhdGlvbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After a month of yellow drinking water Altus officials say they've addressed high manganese concentrations,"Altus resident Robert Kilburn said he got used to the yellow water after a while.

“The water had been milky and kind of yellowish for probably a few weeks” he said.

But on Sept. 12 and 13 the water coming from Kilburn’s kitchen tap was the darkest yellow he had seen yet. He grabbed an empty jug and filled it with the amber liquid.

He said the water is usually darkest when he first turns on a tap in the morning and he wanted to capture it at its least appetizing point.

“What’s in that jug is the worst-case scenario” Kilburn said. But when he collected another jug that afternoon the water looked even darker.

Kilburn’s observation matched the city’s data— Sept. 12 showed the highest manganese levels Altus’s water treatment plant has recorded this summer .

Altus gets its water from Tom Steed Reservoir. Chris Riffle is the city’s special projects and communications director. When Altus residents first started getting yellow water out of their pipes  Riffle said the city believed the problem would be resolved quickly.

“The cause of it was entirely natural” Riffle said. “Tom Steed Reservoir apparently did what they call a lake turn.”

During extended hot periods the water in a deep lake settles into layers. The sun-warmed surface doesn’t mix with the cool dark water below.

But as the water on the lake’s surface cools at the end of summer those layers start to mix. Some of the nutrients and chemicals that were stuck at the bottom of the lake float to the top. Seasonal turnover is crucial for the health of a lake’s plant and animal life. But it can change the taste and chemical makeup of drinking water drawn from the lake.

Kateleigh Mills / KOSU Throughout August and September Tom Steed Reservoir has sat about 6 feet lower than normal.

Altus draws their municipal water from Tom Steed Reservoir. On top of the lake turn drought in southeastern Oklahoma has caused Tom Steed to sit about six feet lower than normal. These drought conditions could be causing longer-term changes to the reservoir’s composition Riffle explained.

“We've seen some levels of salts and minerals in that raw water change over the last month to some levels that we frankly haven't seen in a very long time” Riffle said.

But the city is working to adapt its treatment strategies.

“Dirty water is not the new norm” Assistant City Manager Terry Mosley said at a town hall meeting on Sept. 19 . “The new norm is our aggressive nature in monitoring testing and treating what we feel like maybe prolonged levels of the manganese situation.”

Manganese in drinking water is monitored but not regulated

For chemicals that are known to pose health risks at certain levels the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sets regulatory standards that states must legally enforce. When a water system violates one of those primary standards there’s a legal framework for addressing the problem.

There aren’t primary regulatory standards for manganese because the EPA considers it safe.

“It's in foods it's in Gatorade it's in multivitamins” said Johnny Barron Altus’s city engineer and public works director. “It's kind of like iron—there's just no regulatory limit. If it were likely to cause significant harm there would be limits set by EPA.”

Manganese is important for healthy bone brain and joint function. Most people get enough manganese from their diet and drinking water. Some even take supplement pills to increase their manganese intake.

“They say manganese is actually a nutrient the body needs but not a whole lot” Kilburn said gesturing to his bottles of yellow water. “Not that much.”

Although it’s rare very high doses of manganese can cause neurological problems. Manganese-related disorders are usually only found in people with jobs where they regularly breathe in manganese dust over long periods of time . Those occupations include manganese miners and agricultural workers who spray pesticides that contain the metal.

Those harmful doses are so high and require such long exposures that researchers haven’t determined exactly how much manganese it takes to cause health problems according to Erin Hatfield with the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality.

So the EPA classifies manganese as a “nuisance chemical”: a chemical that can make drinking water unpleasant but not unsafe. Because of that there’s no enforceable limit for manganese that could put a water system in legal violation with the EPA or the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality.

However the EPA describes non-enforceable non-regulatory health advisory levels for manganese which serve as guidelines for keeping nuisance chemicals under control . These are manganese concentrations that the EPA knows to be safe. This doesn’t necessarily mean that water above those concentrations is toxic; but these doses have been studied and proven to be safe. The agency provides more information about how they determined their guidelines on page 34 of its Drinking Water Health Advisory for Manganese .

Altus stuck on a roller coaster of manganese concentrations

Since Altus’s manganese concentrations first rose in early August they’ve yo-yoed up and down experiencing three spikes above the 0.3 milligrams per liter threshold. On Sept. 12 the manganese concentration in Altus’s treated water rose above 1 milligram per liter for the first time according to manganese testing levels the city shared on its Facebook page .

Riffle offered some simple advice to Altus’s water customers: “If yucky water comes out of your tap don't drink it.”

Riffle said he uses a countertop Brita filter. Barron’s house came with a reverse osmosis purification system for drinking water. Both men said they didn’t see discoloration in their drinking water at home.

But Kilburn said it wasn’t that simple for him. After collecting samples of his dark yellow tap water Kilburn went to buy bottled water for him and his pets.

“I went into Walmart and all the gallon jugs were gone” he said. “They had a few of the expensive gourmet kinds of water in the fancy jugs. But all the regular gallons and bottled water were gone.” Because the tap water wasn’t unsafe the city did not provide bottled water for residents.

Hatfield with the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality said that these problems aren’t limited to Altus. The nearby cities of Frederick and Snyder which also get their drinking water from Tom Steed Reservoir have measured high manganese concentrations as well.

Hatfield said that the systems have been treating the water with certain salts that make it possible to filter out solid manganese. Those treatments enabled Altus to keep its manganese concentrations below 0.3 milligrams per liter for weeks at a time but they spiked again on Sept. 11 and 12.

Kateleigh Mills / KOSU Robert Kilburn and other Altus residents turned to bottled water during the manganese issues last month.

“The issue at Altus is that the system had temporarily run out of that chemical supply” Hatfield said referring to the salts that allow manganese to be filtered. “So they were waiting on a shipment. And now that it’s come in they were already seeing some of the issues being resolved.”

Keeping an eye on the future of Altus’s water

Before the recent manganese issues Altus’s water quality was on the upswing after a slew of issues. In 2012 performance issues and a lawsuit caused the city to close its water treatment plant. A few years later the city violated the EPA’s regulatory limit for trihalomethanes  which can lead to increase cancer risks. Altus is in Jackson County which ranked 8th on a list of U.S. counties with the most EPA contaminant violations in 2017.

But since then the city’s drinking water has met all of the EPA’s regulatory requirements. Barron said that’s thanks to tireless work from workers at the treatment plant. Altus nearly won the American Water Works Association’s state drinking water taste contest this year.

“We tied for first place in a blind taste test” Barron said. “In the tiebreaker we lost to Midwest City but I'm proud of the water we put out. I think it's it's good quality water and I have no problem drinking it.”

The city is making improvements to their treatment and monitoring systems that Barron said should head off any future issues.

“We weren't ready for the manganese when it hit” Barron said. “We didn't have everything on hand that we needed and it took us a little to catch up to it. It's money we should have been spending all along.”

Residents have asked for more frequent updates on the manganese levels at the water treatment plant. Barron said the city is considering purchasing a monitor that would take continuous manganese measurements. But Riffle said the city isn’t sure how often it would share those measurements with the public.

In the meantime Oklahomans can check their water system's annual consumer confidence report through the DEQ’s Safe Drinking Water Information System .

“You can look at any system’s drinking water the testing they've done and if they have violations” Hatfield said.

The Oklahoma DEQ offers a fact sheet on manganese in drinking water . It advises that washing clothes with manganese-tainted water can stain them. Boiling water does not decrease its manganese levels. Instead the manganese stays in the pot while the water evaporates away leading to even higher concentrations.

The manganese in Altus’s treated drinking water has once again come down to normal.

“It’s back to it's clear now” Kilburn said. “It's not the light yellow color was for about a month.”

But after that month of ups and downs Kilburn said he’s sticking with bottled water for the time being. He doesn’t seem to be alone—many shoppers at Altus’s Walmart were still loading their carts with water bottles at the end of September.

City officials are still working to reassure them that the water is safe.

“This stuff literally keeps us up at night” Barron said. “We hate so much that it happened and we're doing everything to make sure it doesn't happen again.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8wNC9idXNpbmVzcy9saXF1aWQtZGVhdGgtd2F0ZXItdmFsdWF0aW9uL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAUhodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIyLzEwLzA0L2J1c2luZXNzL2xpcXVpZC1kZWF0aC13YXRlci12YWx1YXRpb24?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Liquid Death canned water company is now worth $700 million,"1.

Can you tell us more about your role and what makes you most excited to work at Amgen?

Amgen’s mission is personal to me. As an asthma patient niece and daughter of a cancer patient it is more meaningful for me to work for an organization that produces medicines that have been valuable to my life and others in their battles with cancer and other diseases.

Currently I serve as the senior manager in the Digital Technology & Innovation function. Previously I led the delivery of Enterprise Data & Analytics platform projects and executed on multiple strategic initiatives. I am also a passionate Employee Resource Group (ERG) leader for the Amgen Latino Employee Network (ALEN). I love the diversity of talent and culture everyone brings to work every day and believe representation matters. A diverse team inspires our staff to see themselves in a position and develop greater short and long-term goals with the motivation to achieve greater things.

You were instrumental in starting the ALEN Chapter in Tampa. What inspired you to start ALEN Tampa and how would you describe the growth today?

When I joined Amgen in 2017 I reached out to the ALEN Global team in search of Latinos in the workplace to feel a little piece of home. Six months later I started the ALEN Tampa Chapter – the first ALEN approved chapter outside of our headquarters in Thousand Oaks. Throughout my three years serving as the Chairwoman I helped increase the ALEN network led Hispanic Heritage events showcasing our successful Latin employees as well as career and community events. The process was possible with the support of an awesome Chapter Leadership Team and Sponsor that helped me achieve all our goals. I remember when we started our first meeting had about 10 people. Today we have 99 registered members at our Tampa site and 521 members globally.

As a native of Puerto Rico why was it important to instill your cultural roots in your children?

Every day I am inspired to represent my heritage and aspire to be a role model for my kids. As a Puerto Rican born and raised on the island I have the passion and pride to share my heritage and cultural background with others. It is important for me to maintain the integrity and pride of where we came from while embracing respecting and learning from other cultures.

In a more personal matter we speak Spanish at home. I also share my love for my country through cooking traditional meals so my children can continue to keep our heritage and traditions alive with our family’s future generations. This is super important to me as this is what I am proud of – my heart and my love for where I come from. For all of us that leave our “homes” it is that connection with traditions that takes us back to those beautiful experiences we pass on to our kids to appreciate.

In Tampa we know the ERG community is very family oriented. Have you ever shared your heritage or cooking traditions with your colleagues?

Yes! And I love it! As a foodie I love sharing the sabor latino in our food. During a staff potluck I took the opportunity to cook and showcase a Puerto Rican dish – a savory chicken stew and green pigeon peas yellow rice. I can say that there were no leftovers! And I have shared my Sofrito recipe this is the base of our Puerto Rican cooking besides cooking with love.

During Hispanic Heritage Month we would coordinate with the cafeteria to highlight Latino foods so we can share with others the diverse influences of our food. Do you know about mofongo? It is delicious!

What was your experience like moving from Puerto Rico to Tampa and the U.S.?

It was very difficult at the beginning. I was a first-time mom missing my family relatives and friends. I love the beach the mountains the festivities during the holidays and well the food and the beautiful coqui sound.

Having my first baby it was super difficult for me to find daycare for a six week-old in a country and state I had never lived in. At work having to translate in your head every word from Spanish to English in every interaction was not easy to do when your natural reaction is to respond in Spanish.

The weather – I know Tampa is hot and humid but it has cold days believe it or not. Those lower than 50-degree days we sometimes get here do not happen in Puerto Rico at all. The beautiful “Isla del Encanto” has beach weather all year long where you can enjoy being outside at any time. But to make my transition easier I searched for places similar to home where I could enjoy bringing those great memories back. It was also fun to explore and learn new things.

Information Systems/Technology has traditionally been viewed as a male-dominated industry. What spurred your interest?

In high school I had a Visual Basic class and I was good at solving the problems by creating solutions with that programming language. Therefore I decided to pursue my bachelor’s in information systems – I loved the systems analysis and design. That is why I decided focus most of my career on enhancing user experience.

Have you faced any related obstacles as a Latina woman working in the IS field?

Yes trying to be successful in a male-dominated industry has not always been easy. I once had a manager that suggested I hire an at home nanny to take care of my kids so I could stay over my 8 hours at work. Working 10-12 hours a day was the norm and his belief was that I needed to work extra hours to grow in my career at that organization. He would compare me to the other men that stayed longer hours in which the majority had a stay-at-home wife and no need to run out the door to get their children.

In another experience a manager said my other Latina colleagues and I are too passionate too emotional and we needed to “chill out” as that is “not the way they worked” at that company. If being enthusiastic defending what you believe in putting dedication to achieve goals providing your honest and professional feedback in an open forum where you can be your authentic self is called too passionate and emotional…then I am all that and proud.

Through my career journey I struggled multiple times with wanting to give up on the IT world. As a very independent woman who is ambitious with my career aspirations I wanted to grow and achieve but I also wanted to be the best mom I could be for my kids. On many occasions I felt I could not be a successful professional and a great mom. For me to navigate that I reached out to my pillar my mom and my mentors that could provide advice and guide me through my situation to achieve both. I can tell you that all my career decisions have been made based on putting my kids first and then my career so I could be present and not miss any school or extracurricular events in their lives.

Can you share a role model that gave you the motivation to continue striving in your career?

My mom is the best role model. She is a strong dedicated and hardworking woman and her professional ethics are extraordinary. My mom without a college degree always made sure to learn everything she could to become the best at her job. She pushed herself every single time. Her perseverance tenacity and resilience are admirable. By herself she was able to raise and provide the best education and opportunities for me and my sister. I am very thankful for her and for passing along my tenacity.

Why do you think it’s important for all career levels to act as mentors?

As a people leader I like to pay it forward. Part of my responsibility is to support my staff in their career path and I am truly invested in their development. Intentionally dedicating time and genuinely caring about staff career aspirations increases morale and engagement. In doing so they will feel heard and supported to define a clear path of continuous improvement. There is no better moment than seeing your team grow and succeed and it will encourage them to pass it on to the next generation as well.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZXBoYXJtYS5jb20vcGhhcm1hL3RldmEtbGFuZHMtaGl0LWFnYWluc3QtZWxpLWxpbGx5cy1lbWdhbGl0eS1sb25nLXJ1bm5pbmctbWlncmFpbmUtcGF0ZW50LWZldWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Teva notched a win in its migraine patent feud with Eli Lilly,"While much of the current migraine hubbub revolves around AbbVie's oral franchise and Pfizer's Nurtec ODT a patent feud between a pair of veteran injectables has been quietly raging in the background. Early this week Teva Pharmaceutical parried a riposte from Eli Lilly.

Monday a judge in Boston swatted down Eli Lilly’s attempt to invalidate three Teva-held patents surrounding its migraine antibody Ajovy. The ruling tees up a trial slated for Oct. 18. In the case Teva alleges Lilly’s rival antibody Emgality infringes a trio of Ajovy patents according to Reuters.

Teva’s case has been running for four years and originally accused Lilly of treading on nine Ajovy patents. Teva and Lilly followed Amgen’s injectable Aimovig onto the CGRP migraine prevention market back in 2018 and after Emgality’s approval Teva filed suit.

All three companies’ drugs prevent migraines by blocking the release of calcitonin gene-related peptides.

Separately Lilly previously challenged Teva’s clutch of patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) with mixed results: The agency nixed six Teva patents in early 2020 while upholding the other three.

In light of the latest decision a Teva spokesperson told Reuters the company looks forward to the trial and plans to “defend [its] IP vigorously.” The company did not immediately respond to Fierce Pharma’s request for comment.

Related Eli Lilly finds stigma is one of the worst parts of migraine as it aims to help break the taboo

Teva has pinned big hopes on Ajovy as a growth driver amid a major business turnaround from CEO Kåre Schultz. Still the injectable’s performance has historically been weakest among the first wave of anti-CGRP drugs.

Nowadays those injectables face an even bigger threat in orals from Pfizer and AbbVie which also markets an oral migraine treatment in Ubrelvy. Pfizer's Nurtec for its part is approved as a dual therapy for both acute and preventive uses. Biohaven developed the drug and recently sold itself to drug behemoth Pfizer.

Meanwhile Lilly and Teva’s patent kerfuffle doesn’t end here. Last summer Teva filed a new lawsuit against Lilly in Massachusetts federal court the very same day it scored two new Ajovy patents from the U.S. PTO.

Teva argued Emgality infringes the new duo of patents and said at the time it was looking to block Lilly from making and selling its CGRP inhibitor in the U.S. Teva also asked for damages in the case.

Last year Lilly pulled down more than $577 million global sales of Emgality while Teva’s Ajovy snared $313 million over the same period. Amgen's Aimovig for its part also generated $313 million.",,,,,,

The MPO connector and patch-cord gets hand-assembled into a metallic plug based on a MIL-STD-38999 Series III shell size 13 connector.





The overall effect is to produce a 28 mm diameter connector that carries 12 or 24 fibre channels couples with a tri-thread for shock and vibration resistance and is sealed to IP68.





Optical field-termination is not necessary and assembly can be tool-less said Amphenol although a wrench may be required to fully tighten the plug shell onto the back shell.

The combination is resistant to “harsh environment applications such as high speed embedded network backbones for battleships armoured vehicles or airplanes and trains data centres in harsh environments or track-side measuring and inspection systems for trains” according to the company.

Typical insertion loss is 0.5dB and rated lifetime 500 mating-unmating cycles for a change of <0.2dB.

The range also includes square flange and jam nut panel-mount receptacles and there is an extraction tool for dismantling the assemblies.

There is a example assembly video on YouTube and the MPO Field product page can be found here

By selecting a boost converter with a high maximum duty cycle it may seem possible to generate a high output voltage from a low supply voltage. However there’s more to it than that. Besides the duty-cycle limits the maximum possible voltage gain also must be considered.

The voltage gain describes the maximum possible output voltage of a boost converter in relation to the available input voltage. This limitation of the boost converter can be thought of in the following way: With the boost all energy transferred from the input side to the output side must first be temporarily stored. During the on time—i.e. when the switch (S) in Figure 1 is on—energy is temporarily stored in the inductor (L). At this time the diode (D) blocks the current flow.

During the off time the temporarily stored energy is removed from the inductor (L). Both the charging and the discharging of the inductor must follow the rules of the inductance. The current flow in each case is determined by the inductance value of the inductor and the respective voltage difference across the inductor. The voltage across the inductor can simply be described as V IN during the charging time and V OUT minus V IN during the off time.

With a high-voltage gain the off time may not be long enough for the temporarily stored energy to be recovered from the inductor. Thus the simplified formula that describes the duty cycle in Equation 1 doesn’t account for this limitation. The formula for the maximum voltage gain can only be recognized if the dc resistance (DCR) of the inductor and the load resistance also are taken into account:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vaGRyLXNjcmVlbi1zcGVjcy10by1sb29rLWZvci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Choose an HDR Screen: 5 Specs You Must Look For,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vaGRyLXNjcmVlbi1zcGVjcy10by1sb29rLWZvci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMizwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIyMTAwNDAwNTU2Ny9lbi9PTU5JVklTSU9OJUUyJTgwJTk5cy1OZXctNC1tZWdhcGl4ZWwtSW1hZ2UtU2Vuc29yLXdpdGgtT21uaVBpeGVsJUMyJUFFMy1IUy1Qcm92aWRlcy1IaWdoLVJlc29sdXRpb24taW4tYS1TbWFsbC1QYWNrYWdlLWZvci1TbWFydC1Ib21lLVNlY3VyaXR5LUNhbWVyYXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OMNIVISION's New 4-megapixel Image Sensor with OmniPixel®3-HS Provides High Resolution in a Small Package for ...,"SANTA CLARA Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--OMNIVISION a leading global developer of semiconductor solutions including advanced digital imaging analog and touch & display technology today announced the new OS04L CMOS 4-megapixel (MP) image sensor that brings 2K resolution digital images and high-definition (HD) video to consumer security devices including smart home doorbell baby monitor IP and HD analog cameras.

He’s a deeply analog man who doesn’t own a TV or even a radio even if he likes listening to his “Country Western” tunes in the car sometimes. He comes to life not just when Craig reads material like Heart of Darkness but when they discuss the themes after. It’s a formative friendship for Craig and a lovely final chapter for Mr. Harrigan who clearly has stepped on a few people on his climb up the corporate ladder. He encourages Craig to be ruthless and decisive whether it’s in standing up to a high school bully or approaching a girl he likes. He gives Craig confidence and Craig gives him some late-in-life comfort.

And Mr. Harrigan gives him a lottery ticket too. When Craig gets $3000 from his scratch-off gift he decides to take some of that money to introduce the old man to the iWorld. At first Mr. Harrigan refuses until the kid points out how much the business savvy Harrigan can stay on top of the market and breaking financial news. It’s not long before Harrigan himself is hooked on his phone allowing Hancock and Sutherland a truly eye-rolling speech about the danger of giving up reality for the life of a smartphone. As Harrigan goes on about how these devices will be used for fake news and misinformation (he’s “frightened by this gizmo”) the film devolves into a heavy-handed cautionary tale with blunt messaging that the source material didn’t need.

In its original form “Mr. Harrigan’s Phone” works better as a conversation starter about justice and power than anything literal. You see when the old man kicks the bucket Craig puts his new phone in the casket with him and well things start to happen. Without spoiling Craig leaves messages for Mr. Harrigan that seem to impact the real world. What would you do with that kind of power?

The film version of “Mr. Harrigan’s Phone” needs to be a morality tale for its protagonist and viewer a questioning of how far we’re willing to go to right the wrongs of the world. If Mr. Harrigan himself had the power that Craig ends up having he would have used it in malevolent ways and so this really should be a story of a young man facing a moral quandary about what to do with an impossible power. It becomes that barely in the final act but it’s such a dull slog to get there."

The assessment known as the Mental Health at Work Index will score the effectiveness of an organization’s mental-health programs and recommend enhancements. The goal is to “help define what good looks like” said Christina McCarthy executive director of One Mind at Work the nonprofit that spearheaded the venture.

One Mind at Work measurement company Ethisphere and experts at Columbia University have spent the past year designing the index which they describe as a standardized assessment of programs and practices that support workforce wellbeing. AXA and close to 40 corporate partnersincluding Aon Plc and Prudential Financial Inc. will pilot-test the index which has received $3 million in funding and supplants a simpler assessment One Mind previously used. The index should be available for any business to purchase early next year. The scorecard’s backers hope it can address levels of stress anxiety and depression that soared during the pandemic costing organizations 12 billion workdays a year according to the World Health Organization.

“This costs a massive amount and CEOs know this needs to be tackled” Gordon Watson AXA’s CEO of Asia and Africa said in an interview. “But it’s like a slippery fish that we can’t get our hands around. You have meditation apps and apps to sleep better but no real integrated approach. Are we doing well? We don’t know. How do we measure progress? How are we compared to our competitors? So we had the idea to make that visible and tangible.”

The index hopes to cut through the surfeit of surveys and services that have proliferated over the past three years as employees dealt with the ravages of COVID-19 racial-justice protests following George Floyd’s murder and remote work’s disruption of work-life balance. More than 75% of full-time US workers reported experiencing at least one symptom of a mental health condition last year up from 59% in 2019 according to Mind Share Partners a mental-health nonprofit. Workplace-focused startups like Lyra Health Inc. Spring Health and Ginger have emerged and organizations have added a slew of wellbeing programs perks and apps.

The problem though is that “most organizations are just throwing spaghetti against the wall to see what sticks” said Kathy Pike a psychology professor at Columbia and director of the Columbia-WHO Center for Global Mental Health. “There’s a plethora of commercial products for sale but no guidance on what to do. You can’t decide what product to buy if you don’t know what problem to solve.”

One challenge: long-standing stigmas around seeking help for mental health limit the reach and effectiveness of workplace offerings. Despite the slew of new wellness products the mental health of working Americans has barely budged since the pandemic hit according to an index compiled by benefits administrator LifeWorks now part of Telus Corp.

Organizations using One Mind’s new tool complete a 76-question self-evaluation which delves into 10 areas including employment practices communication training and benefits. They receive a “maturity score” for each category from one (bad) to five (best) and an overall rating. Companies review their scores get recommendations for improvements and can request deeper evaluations of their programs from experts like Pike. As more companies take the assessment industry-wide comparisons will be available McCarthy said. One Mind’s 150 member organizations — which include Accenture Delta Air Lines Inc. and Mastercard Inc. — will initially get free access to test out the scorecard as will Ethisphere’s corporate members such as Microsoft Corp. and Coca-Cola Co.

One Mind at Work representatives declined to disclose how much the index will cost once it’s widely available next year but said the price will be based on whether businesses just do the self-evaluation or seek additional assistance and resources.

Industry experts not involved in the index’s development said while it’s not perfect it’s definitely a step forward. “You can have a lot of programs and processes and still miss the boat” said Mike Thompson chief executive officer of the National Alliance of Healthcare Purchaser Coalitions which represents 12000 employers. “The value of having a scoring mechanism is that it helps me find out what I am doing well and what could I do better. So this is good.”

Darcy Gruttadaro chief innovation officer at the National Alliance on Mental Illness said she’ s concerned that only big well-heeled companies will use the tool and that it might not drill down deep enough to understand what makes employees reluctant to seek help. Half of those who live with mental-health conditions are not in care according to the National Institute of Mental Health.

Still the idea of a scorecard should resonate with CEOs according to AXA’s Watson as “they get numbers they get rankings.” Not engaging with employee mental health can also be costly.

Depression alone accounts for 200 million lost workdays annually costing U.S. employers between $17 billion and $44 billion in lost productivity according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Delaying treatment for a mental-health condition can also quadruple the annual cost of medical-health claims later on.

“It makes business sense to do this” Watson said.

TD was reached at 5290 m similar to the 5 to 6 km TD range for the wells in this basin and over 34 m of oil pay was recorded in the Campanian.

Baja is reported to be a down-dip lobe of the Krabdagu depositional system which was successfully drilled to the west in Block 58 by APA and TotalEnergies. APA have been working on Block 53 a number of years and drilled the Popokai 1 well (oil shows) in 2015. In 2017 the current operating group drilled the Kolibrie 1 well to the east of the block again with only oil shows in the Upper Cretaceous.

Most recently in April 2022 the operating group drilled the dry Rasper well in the north of the block in 2000 m water. With 34 m pay and a number of misses APA and partners will need to decide if this is a commercial extension of the Suriname Campanian play but for now the area remains part of a prolific petroleum basin.

Petronas and ExxonMobil are considering drilling options south of Baja in Block 52 with further opportunities to stretch the model. Block 58 remains the most successful block offshore Suriname and Total Energies and APA will continue to evaluate the commerciality of five discoveries there. The group is currently taking an extension to the exploration phase on that block where they also plan to appraise the Sapakara field. The Gerry de Souza rig will mobilise to Block 58 for the Awari 1 well located north of the original Maka Central discovery.

Austin Amelio (Everybody Wants Some) Retta (Good Boys) and Molly Bernard (Sully) have also joined the film’s cast and will star alongside Glen Powell and Adria Arjona who were previously announced in starring roles.

Based on a true story Powell stars in the film as the most sought-after Hitman in New Orleans but if you pay him to rub out a cheating spouse or a sadistic boss you’d better watch out: he works for the cops. When he breaks protocol to help a desperate woman (Arjona) trying to get away from an abusive boyfriend he finds himself living the life of one of his false personas falling for the woman and flirting with becoming a criminal himself.

The action comedy is produced by Linklater and Michael Blizzard for Detour Pictures Michael Costigan and Jason Bateman for Aggregate Films and Powell for BarnStorm Productions in association with Cinetic Media.

This is the fourth project Linklater and Powell have worked on together following Fast Food Nation Everybody Wants Some!! and Apollo 10½: A Space Age Childhood.

Linklater Powell and Arjona are repped by CAA; Amelio is repped by UTA; Retta is repped by UTA and Silver Lining Entertainment; and Bernard is repped by APA and D2 Management.

UPDATE

Apple expands its Community Education Initiative accelerating learning opportunities in more than 600 communities

With a focus on equity Apple now works with more than 150 educational partners around the world to provide access to coding creativity and workforce opportunities

Several weeks ago California State University Dominguez Hills (CSUDH) welcomed more than 300 elementary and middle school students from across Los Angeles to its Center for Innovation in STEM Education (CISE) lab for a “STEAM Max” experience. The event gave participants from all backgrounds the opportunity to learn new science and technology skills — including app design. That same week the university kicked off after-school coding clubs at six elementary and middle schools and began hosting a regular Saturday STEM Exploration Day where activities are coached by CSUDH computer science majors.

CSUDH is part of Apple’s Community Education Initiative (CEI) which launched in 2019 to bring coding creativity and career opportunities to learners of all ages and to communities that are traditionally underrepresented in technology. Since then the company has rapidly expanded this work to learners across 99 countries and regions and all 50 states building on years of collaboration with educators and communities.

Through CEI Apple teams up with schools educational institutions and community-based organizations to provide Apple hardware scholarships financial support educator resources and access to teams of Apple experts who work side by side with educators to enhance student learning with technology. Apple collaborates with each partner organization to customize and enhance programming to support the community’s goals bringing together Apple’s unique combination of hardware software and professional learning resources to transform students’ in-school and extracurricular educational experiences.

In the two years since CSUDH first teamed up with Apple the university has brought new STEAM experiences to nearly 2000 students and teachers across greater Los Angeles — and expects to reach another 4000 learners across 40 schools with programming this year. The university also helps educators obtain their certification in computer science instruction to ensure California has enough teachers for coding and IT workforce training classes.

“What astonishes me the most is what we’ve been able to accomplish in such a short period of time because of this unique partnership with Apple” said Dr. Kamal Hamdan director of CSUDH’s CISE lab. “Thousands of students who would have never had access to this type of learning have gone though one of our programs and you can’t put a dollar amount on those experiences. It’s a testament to the fact that when two organizations with like-minded values put their hearts and their heads toward a common goal the sky is the limit in terms of how many lives we can change.”

CSUDH’s ambitious growth plans are reflective of the ongoing expansion of Apple’s CEI work as the company brings new programming and learning opportunities to more partners and learners across the US and globally. Apple kicked off its CEI programming with educators from nearly 70 educational institutions in Austin Texas; Boise Idaho; Columbus Ohio; Houston; Nashville Tennessee; and Northern California. Three years later Apple now has CEI partners in 29 states plus the District of Columbia. Through virtual and in-person programming more than 150 partners have reached learners in nearly 600 communities across 99 countries and regions and all 50 US states.

CEI is rooted in Apple’s four-decade history in education and its commitment to advancing equity and access through education. CEI partners serve communities that have historically been under-resourced and the initiative is designed to create opportunities for learners who may not otherwise have access to technology or workforce resources. The work aligns with Apple’s Racial Equity and Justice Initiative which in part aims to expand opportunities for communities of color through education. Through CEI Apple works with K-12 schools to advance in-school learning organizations that provide out-of-school programming — such as Boys & Girls Clubs of America and Kode With Klossy — and minority-serving institutions including dozens of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic-Serving Institutions.

“We believe education is a powerful force for equity helping learners discover the tools they need to lift up their communities and shape the future” said Lisa Jackson Apple’s vice president of Environment Policy and Social Initiatives. “We’re thrilled to continue to expand our Community Education Initiative so that students of all ages have access to world-class learning opportunities regardless of their zip code.”

Oklahoma City University (OCU) — in partnership with the Cherokee Nation the Choctaw Nation and the Chickasaw Nation — is among Apple’s new CEI partners. Together Apple OCU and the tribal governments have launched a new effort to provide educational opportunities to Native American youth and other young people who live on tribal reservations in Oklahoma with the dual goals of preserving tribal languages and cultures and enabling employment pathways so that young people can pursue their future while living in their tribal communities. The partnership kicks off later this month with a teacher academy for educators working in schools within the reservations of the Cherokee Nation Choctaw Nation and Chickasaw Nation to support their work to integrate creativity and coding concepts in the classroom.

“I’m in awe of the relationship this university has developed with Apple and the impact it will have on our tribal nation partners” said Kenneth Evans OCU’s president. “Together we have the tools technology strategic infrastructure and preservation initiatives that are creating paths to opportunity for future generations. From coding to more broad technical skills we’re helping young people prepare for in-demand jobs while still honoring the heritage language and traditions of the Cherokee Choctaw and Chickasaw nations. As these programs expand so too will their reach enriching communities and preserving legacies for years to come.”

Since launching CEI four years ago Apple has maintained a focus on supporting teachers and educators by providing cutting-edge professional learning opportunities in their communities and expanding programming to dozens of new organizations from coast to coast. New partners include Arizona State University; Arts New Orleans; the Center for Black Educator Development in Philadelphia; Education Service Center Region 13 in Austin; the Foundation for the Los Angeles Community Colleges; Harry S Truman College in Chicago; Henry Ford College in metro Detroit; Locally Grown Community Forge in Pittsburgh; Miami Dade College; Rutgers 4-H Computers Pathways Program in Newark New Jersey; The New York Public Library TechConnect; University of Colorado Denver; University of Massachusetts Amherst’s Center for Youth Engagement; Wayne State University College of Engineering in Detroit; and more.

The number of US manufacturing sites among Apple’s suppliers increased from 25 to 48 in the course of a year according to the company’s latest supplier list …

The majority of Apple products are made in China though the company has been slowly working on diversifying into other countries. India has become a major secondary manufacturing hub for the company with Vietnam also growing in importance.

The only product with final assembly in the US was the Mac Pro. The 2013 model was made in Apple’s home country and the same was true of the 2019 model (after some uncertainty and an asterisk) – with the Cupertino company stressing that it used components from a dozen US suppliers across eight states.

Apple has now published its latest Supplier List and Bloomberg notes the increase in US manufacturing sites.

Of Apple’s more than 180 suppliers 48 had manufacturing sites in the U.S. as of September 2021 up from 25 a year earlier according to a supplier list released by Apple. More than 30 sites were in California compared with fewer than 10 a year earlier. Many major suppliers such as chip makers Qualcomm Inc. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. product assembler Foxconn Technology Group and image sensor provider Sony Group Corp. added production sites in the U.S. during the year the list shows.

It should be stressed however that “manufacturing” includes small-scale test production and it’s probable that the majority of US manufacturing falls into this category.

Apple is naturally secretive about its exact processes but there are known stages – and it’s likely that two to three of them are carried out in the US. Given COVID-19 lockdowns in China Apple may have moved more of the early test phases to the US.

Prototypes

Prototypes are very early models of new products designed to test out different approaches. Typically they will fall into two categories: design prototypes and functional prototypes.

Design prototypes also referred to as “looks-like” are non-functional models intended to see how a particular design would look and handle. Functional prototypes (“works-like”) are as the name suggests working versions of the technology – but will typically look nothing like the final product.

Apple makes prototypes in its own design studios which include capabilities like computer-controlled milling of aluminum and 3D printing.

Engineering Validation Test (EVT)

This is the point at which the design and functional prototypes come together producing devices that use the intended materials and which both look and work like the final product.

The EVT is intended to ensure it really is practical to manufacture the product in its intended form and to identify production challenges that may need to be overcome.

Companies typically make anywhere from 100 to 1000 EVT devices and it is likely that some of these are made in the US.

Design Validation Test (DVT)

These are products made using the exact processes intended to be used on the final production line and to experiment with potential alternatives. Every variation (color capacity etc.) is made. Typical quantities for Apple are likely to be in the low single-digit thousands. This work may be split between US and China.

Production Validation Test (PVT)

This is the final test phase carried out on the actual production lines to ensure that quality yields timings and costs are all as expected. This is done in the country of manufacture.

Apple’s hybrid approaches

Typically for those stages carried out in China (or elsewhere) Apple would send its own engineers over to supervise and monitor. COVID-19 lockdowns made this difficult or impossible so Apple developed new remote working processes including live-streaming from production lines.

The iPhone maker has also adopted some technology including live-streaming that helps staff based at its headquarters in Cupertino Calif. remotely follow what’s happening on China’s factory floors the people said. Apple has used iPads to communicate and augmented-reality tools to help technical experts in Cupertino check factory issues.

Chinese managers were also given greater powers although final decisions were still made in Cupertino.

This stocky microscopic animal also known as a water bear can survive in environments where survival seems impossible. Tardigrades have been shown to endure extremes of heat cold and pressure — and even the vacuum of space — by entering a state of suspended animation and revitalizing sometimes decades later under more hospitable conditions.

If she could understand the mechanism behind this extraordinary preservation Maynard reckoned she might be able to use the knowledge to improve medicines so that they remain potent longer and are less vulnerable to typical environmental challenges ultimately broadening access and benefiting human health.

It turns out that one of the process protecting tardigrades is spurred by a sugar molecule called trehalose commonly found in living things from plants to microbes to insects some of which use it as blood sugar. For a few select organisms such as the water bear and the spiky resurrection plant that can revive after years of near-zero metabolism and complete dehydration trehalose’s stabilizing power is the secret to their unearthly fortitude.

Armed with this insight Maynard a professor of chemistry and biochemistry who holds UCLA’s Dr. Myung Ki Hong Chair in Polymer Science invented a polymer based on the sugar. Her polymer called poly(trehalose methacrylate) or pTrMA actually seems to improve upon nature in its ability to render drugs more robust to the ravages of time and temperature.

“We figured that if trehalose could stabilize entire organisms that makes it a pretty good stabilizer” said Maynard who is also the associate director of technology and development at the California NanoSystems Institute at UCLA. “However that our polymer outperformed trehalose was not expected.”

With support and guidance from the UCLA Innovation Fund a program designed to facilitate the commercialization of UCLA-owned therapies and other health-related technologies Maynard and her team opted to investigate pTrMA’s effects on insulin a World Health Organization “essential medicine” that many people with diabetes inject daily to manage the disease.

When exposed to heat or shaken up too much insulin proteins can clump in ways that gum up needles make the medicine less effective or even prompt a harmful reaction from the body’s natural defenses. As a result insulin must be handled with care and transported in refrigerated compartments.

Accordingly insulin that remains stable for longer without refrigeration could reduce the drug’s cost by making logistics less expensive. And an extended shelf life would cut back on both wasted medicine and potentially dangerous situations where expired insulin delivers an inadequate dose. More than that insulin could become accessible to some remote locales that are currently out of reach for refrigerated transport.

A series of studies led by Maynard over the last three years has demonstrated pTrMA’s potential. A recent Innovation Fund–supported study published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces found that the polymer preserved insulin at temperatures of nearly 200 degrees Fahrenheit — close to water’s boiling point — and through almost a year of refrigerated storage with 87% of the medication remaining intact compared with less than 8% of insulin alone. Laboratory experiments into pTrMA’s safety showed that it did not trigger an immune response in mice.

A 2021 study also backed by the Innovation Fund showed that insulin plus pTrMA has a low enough viscosity to be safely injected and 2020 research demonstrated that a version of pTrMA designed to degrade inside the body retained the ability to stabilize insulin.

An early finding from 2014 that pTrMA actually works better than trehalose as a preserving agent hasn’t been the only pleasant surprise along the way. Maynard’s team typically designs polymers to be chemically linked to drug molecules but in the case of pTrMA they found that it is equally effective intermingled alongside insulin molecules without chemical links.

Maynard suspects that the polymer has potential for broader use.

“Trehalose polymers stabilize a wide range of proteins and enzymes” she said. “Vaccines are a possibility and we think that the polymers could be a platform technology applied to an array of different biologically based drugs.”

Flexible resources from the Innovation Fund have allowed Maynard the freedom to pursue the most relevant questions in her studies. That benefit ended up working in concert with another: introductions to pharmaceutical industry experts by UCLA’s Technology Development Group.

One such expert recommended that Maynard investigate the action of the pTrMA in the body. In her recent ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces publication on pTrMA Maynard and her team found no significant difference in blood plasma concentrations over time between insulin alone and the drug formulated with pTrMA.

“It’s not always easy to find funding for some of the systematic studies we’ve been conducting” Maynard said. “The UCLA Innovation Fund accelerated the research and gave us the ability to pivot.”

If Maynard’s polymer finds continued success as a safe stabilizer drugs from the lifesaving to the everyday could become cheaper and available in more places. And she’ll have a couple of others to thank: Mother Nature and the nigh-indestructible water bear.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpemNoaW5hLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEwLzA0L3RvcC0xMC1nbG9iYWwtc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3Rvci1tYW51ZmFjdHVyZXJzLWluLWgxLTIwMjIv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2l6Y2hpbmEuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMDQvdG9wLTEwLWdsb2JhbC1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJlcnMtaW4taDEtMjAyMi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 10 global semiconductor manufacturers in H1 2022,"The global semiconductor market has been facing a tough time with chip shortages and other issues. The supply chain is struggling while the companies that buy the chips are cutting down their orders. However this will not stop the production in the industry. A recent report from CINNO Research reveals the top 10 global semiconductor equipment companies by revenue. According to the report in the first half of 2022 the total semiconductor business revenue hits $47.3 billion. This is an increase of 4.2% year on year and a month on month decrease of 7.6%. In the second quarter of 2022 alone the total revenue hit $23.9 billion. This is for the top 10 global semiconductor equipment business revenue rankings. This revenue is also basically the same as the total revenue in Q1’22.

Interestingly the top 10 global semiconductor manufacturers’ rating for the first quarter of 2022 is similar to the ranking for the first half of 2022. However there is a slight change in the ranking. The ranking is for only companies in the global listing. Another interesting aspect of the list is that all the companies come from three countries. We have Japan the U.S. and the Netherlands. While Japan clearly dominates the list with five slots the U.S has three slots while the Netherlands has two slots.

Top global semiconductor manufacturers

The report shows that the American company Applied Materials (AMAT) 1H’22 revenue exceed $10 billion dollars. The company ranks first in the top 10 global semiconductor manufacturers ranking. In the second position is the Dutch company Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography (ASML). The company had to recover four positions to sit in the second position in H1 2022 ranking. An American company Lam Research remains in the third position. This is the same position it occupies in the Q2 2022 ranking. Japanese company Tokyo Electron (TEL) sits in the fourth position in the first half of 2022. It drops from second place to fourth place in Q1’22 ranking to fourth. In terms of revenue the top four semiconductor manufacturers have a revenue of over $7.6 billion. This is of course the semiconductor business revenue for the four companies in the first half of 2022.

Note: Exchange rate for this ranking

1 EUR = 1.20 USD

1 JPY = 0.009 USD in 2021

1 EUR = 1.04 USD

1 JPY = 0.007 USD in 2022.

Also this revenue ranking is based on the revenue of the semiconductor business. It excludes the revenue of other businesses such as FPD and PCB.

Their research has appeared in the journal ACS Applied Electronic Materials.

Background to the Research

3D-correlated systems possess vast application potential in numerous innovative research fields. These systems display complex electronic phase transitions which makes them intriguing candidates for technologies such as cognitive computing photonics logic-memory systems and high-performance energy conversion devices.

This property of these systems can be attributed to metal-insulator transition phenomena. Metal-insulator transition is extremely sensitive to carrier/ionic doping and the electrons’ orbital occupancy. Several ionic species can be used to dope these systems with proton doping being an intriguing approach due to the high ion mobility and small radii of protons.

External electrical fields can be applied to protons to control their diffusion and distribution and this facile approach can be used to construct a controlled-ionotropic device. Highly tunable and sensitive these novel devices function based on the principle of proton motion. Proton doping can help overcome the current limitations of semiconductor devices.

In 3D-correlated systems proton interaction is a particularly complex phenomenon due to the interplay between degrees of freedom such as the system’s correlated electronic state. Perovskite RNiO 3 has garnered widespread interest for correlated ionotronics device applications because of its non-volatile and reversible proton-induced resistivity modulation.

Several studies have investigated this perovskite material for this technological application with significant research on uncovering the relationship between natural thin-film conditions lattice strain and the proton-induced resistivity modulation dynamics.

Bulk NNO has emerged as a perovskite RNiO 3 of note in recent studies. This orthorhombic perovskite-structured material possesses some key benefits over previously reported RiNO 3 perovskites such as SNO such as a significantly lower thermally driven MIT temperature. Tuning the biaxial strain of films comprised of bulk NNO has potential benefits such as influencing proton diffusion during catalytic doping.

The authors behind the paper in ACS Applied Electronic Materials have produced novel photon diffusion tunable NNO thin films for use in advanced electronic devices. Their approach employs the Pt-catalytic effect to examine hydrogenation-induced metal-insulator transition in these materials.

The Pt-catalytic effect causes hydrogen molecules to dissociate and produce electrons and protons. This effect allowed the team to investigate proton doping behavior upon resistance modulation. Thus the researchers were able to demonstrate the relationship between tunable proton doping and resistance modulation as a function of the regulated lattice strain in this perovskite system.

Pulsed laser deposition was employed to deposit the NNO thin films with the deposited films then masked with mesh-like patterns using photolithography. RF sputtering was used to deposit platinum on the thin films which formed catalyst pads. Dry etching removed the film’s unmasked regions. The remaining resist was removed by submerging samples in acetone.

The resulting NNO thin films were analyzed and categorized using X-ray diffraction with a physical property measurement system employed to measure the films’ temperature-dependent resistivity. Films were hydrogenated in H 2 . Proton diffusion was examined using optical microscopy.

Study Findings

The study successfully demonstrated the use of lattice strain regulation to fine-tune proton doping in NNO thin films. The crucial role of strain engineering in enabling proton diffusion doping in RNiO 3 perovskites was revealed. The computational analysis supported the author’s innovative experimental approach and confirmed the key role of strain-controlled proton diffusion in determining resistance modulation.

Another key finding in the paper is the enhanced effectiveness of compressive strength for distributing protons in the NNO lattice compared to tensile strain. Lattice strain regulation has the potential to finely tune proton doping behavior and resistance modulation.

Interestingly after hydrogenation the film’s lattice constantly changes leading to an unavoidable change in the perovskite’s structure during proton incorporation and transient diffusion such as elongation. The authors revealed that the substrate-dependent constraint plays a key role in controlling the resulting perovskite structural changes and corresponding properties. Adjusting the substrate conditions can fine-tune the bulk NNO perovskite structure.

In Summary

Overall the paper has unveiled several key effects of their proton-doping approach on NNO thin film perovskite lattice structure properties and characteristics. Strain engineering is a potentially beneficial approach for fine-tuning the proton diffusion in these systems and approaches such as the modification of substrate conditions can also be advantageous.

The strategy presented in the research provides a potentially powerful route for designing and manufacturing multifunctional controlled ionotronic devices and the research provides an important contribution to the field. Future research into engineering thin film properties to produce innovative devices with controlled proton motion could provide further improvements.

Courtesy of StradVision

By Baek Byung-yeul



StradVision a local automotive software company announced an ambitious vision to supply its software to about half of the cars newly produced in the next 10 years the company said Tuesday.



Established in 2014 the Seoul-based company has become a leader in camera perception software that enables self-driving cars to recognize objects based on AI technology.



""We've already signed supply contracts with more than 13 carmakers around the world and our SVNet software is supplied to over 50 car models. We have secured more than 160 patents in the United States and I am confident that we are the world's leader in image recognition"" Kim Jun-hwan CEO of StradVision said during a press conference at the company's headquarters in Seoul.



""Our camera perception software SVNet has established a solid position within the automotive industry. Hyundai Motor Group LG Electronics and Japan's Aisin recognized our technology and business potential at an early stage and have been investing in us from the beginning. We also attracted an investment worth 107.6 billion won ($75.3 million) recently from investors including Aptiv of the U.S. and ZF of Germany.""



StradVision's software is the first to be applied in mass-produced cars and is considered the most mature software in the industry according to Sunny Lee chief operating officer of StradVision and CEO of the company's U.S. branch.



""By 2027 our software will be installed in 10 million cars and by 2032 more than 56 million new cars around half of the cars newly produced yearly around the world will use our software"" she said.



To reach that goal the company reorganized its SVNet software lineup. Specifically SVNet is subdivided into ProDriver which provides various object recognition features during driving ParkAgent for parking assistance ImmersiView which supports augmented reality features and CompliKit which enables its customer companies to use their own data to improve SVNet's features on their own.



The company said its SVNet camera perception software has been installed in 559967 new cars as of June.



""So far we have focused on introducing the latest AI-based vision technology in the automotive industry. But from now on we will reorganize our mission so that our technology can be used in various industries such as logistics aviation and mobility"" the CEO said.

Regardless of how voters cast their ballots the Illinois 13th Congressional District will have a new representative following the upcoming general election. Representing the Republicans Regan Deering won a competitive June primary with four candidates and will face Democrat Nikki Budzinski in November.

More:Nikki Budzinski wins Democratic bid for 13th Congressional District will face Regan Deering

Currently occupied by Rep. Rodney Davis R-Taylorville the seat became open following redistricting by the Illinois General Assembly. Using population data from the 2020 U.S. Census legislators redrew the district into a slimmer zone spanning from Metro East to Champaign — forcing Davis to run in the 15th District race where he lost to Rep. Mary Miller.

The new district favored President Joe Biden by 11% in the 2020 election and is expected to lean Democrat in 2022 according to an analysis by Politico. In the primary results show that more voters within the district cast Republican ballots than Democrat ballots.

With former President Donald Trump losing the district and the state in 2020 Deering did not say if she would support him as a presidential candidate in 2024.

""I have no idea who will be on the ballot in 2024"" she said in a recent interview. ""I am focused on my election in about 45 days in 2022.""

About the candidate

Like her opponent Deering would be a freshman legislator in Congress if elected. She has a background in philanthropy and is the owner of a Huntington Learning Center that provided instruction in the Decatur and Springfield school districts.

In her pre-primary questionnaire Deering said her volunteer role as Northeast Community Fund board president played a major role in the construction of a new multi-million dollar 17000-square-foot facility to benefit low-income families.

Past coverage:Meet Regan Deering 13th Congressional District candidate for Illinois

The Decatur resident has considerable personal wealth according to financial disclosures. She reported a net worth of anywhere from $35 million to $142 million in a May filing with the clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives. Her wealth mostly results from her being a heiress to the multinational food processing company Archer-Daniels-Midland.

In total Deering reported holding stock worth $17 million to $85 million in the company — expanded under her grandfather Dwayne Andreas' near 30-year reign as chief executive officer of ADM.

Deering and her husband Brian have three children.

Here are three key issues in the race:

Cutting the cost of living

With food and energy prices on the rise Deering says addressing cost-of-living expenses is one of her top priorities as a candidate. She pointed to farmers who she said have concerns about higher production costs.

Her opponent Budzinski has criticized the Republican's stance on the Inflation Reduction Act — with special attention given to what she describes as Deering's opposition to the $35 monthly cap for insulin. However Deering maintains that she too would support a limit on insulin prices but not for the IRA.

""I would be all in favor of supporting a cap on life-saving drugs including insulin"" she said during a recent press conference. ""I do understand that is included in the Inflation Reduction Act. Certainly my position was that I was against a vote for the Inflation Reduction Act but I do appreciate that piece of legislation and would certainly support it in a stand-alone bill.""

Wants borders secured

According to the Illinois Department of Public Health opioid overdoses increased by 33% from 2019 to 2020. This increase seen especially among young Americans is one Deering says is being drawn by ""the wide-open border"" where traffickers are bringing drugs into the country.

""I want to advocate for families feeling safe in our communities that would include securing the border"" she said adding later that Illinois and all non-border states are essentially border states under current policies by the Biden administration.

Favors requiring IDs to vote

Like her fellow Republicans coined several times over during their day at the Illinois State Fair Deering is in favor of making ""easier to vote but harder to cheat.""

One way of doing so would be by instituting voter ID laws for which she is an advocate.

""You have to have an ID to do many many things in our daily lives"" she said. ""So knowing that we have that extra layer of making sure that our participants in the election process are in-fact valid is a great place to start.""

What is the campaign's funding source?

As of June 30 Deering had $37598 on hand according to the most recent Federal Election Committee campaign finance disclosures. In total she had received $436806 from individual contributions and spent $399208 primarily on advertising and traveling expenses.

The candidate also contributed $150000 of her own money to the campaign and received nearly $3000 from an employee of Koch Industries.

Who's endorsing Deering?

Deering has received an endorsement from the National Federation of Independent Businesses. She has also secured endorsements from the Illinois Farm Bureau Illinois Right to Life and U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York.

Locally Deering has been endorsed by former Sangamon County Republican Party Chairman Irv Smith and state Sen. Sally Turner R-Beason.

Florence Pourchet has been with BNP Paribas for 30 years and is the bank's most senior female executive in the Americas. She has been the regional head of the bank's ESG initiatives since 2011.

""I have seen a massive transformation in this space over the last 10 years"" she said. ""Back then we were mostly focused on the social aspect–helping local communities and employee volunteerism."" Today Pourchet said ""ESG is part of business as usual and is embedded in all of our products and strategies.""

During the past year BNP was part of a consortium of banks that issued Ford's $2.5 billion inaugural green bond and Archer-Daniels-Midland's inaugural $750 million sustainability bond which aims to reduce the environmental impact of livestock while also promoting sustainable agriculture production.

Pourchet was appointed CEO of Latin America in May 2020 and is responsible for driving a unified business strategy in the six countries including Brazil Chile and Peru the bank has a presence. ""As the head of Latin America I am keenly aware of the impact the region has on global climate change and particularly the Amazon as the 'lungs of the world'"" she said. ""The Amazon and Cerrado in Brazil are impacted by the activities of a number of industries—including beef and soybean production and paper and pulp—that are disrupting the integrity of their unique environments.""

In an effort to protect these vulnerable regions in February 2021 BNP announced that it would only provide financial products or services to producers and traders in the meat industry that have a strategy to achieve zero deforestation in their production and supply chains by 2025. The bank is also encouraging livestock farmers in the region to change their practices to be more respectful of animal welfare.

In addition to being an advocate for the environment Pourchet has been a passionate supporter of causes that help military veterans. She has been the executive sponsor of the bank's military employee resource group which helps veterans transition to civilian and corporate life and earlier this year she sponsored a new partnership with American Corporate Partners that helps veterans transition to the private sector through one-on-one mentoring with business leaders. BNP will provide 25 employee mentors to work with vets over the course of a year.",,,,,,,,,

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

En évitant le démarrage d’un tracteur la manipulation des animaux l’ouverture de barrières le raclage automatique permet d’économiser quotidiennement entre 20 et 60 minutes par rapport à un raclage au rabot (deux raclages par jour sur un à deux couloirs) selon l’Institut de l’élevage. Outre le gain de temps et de confort pour l’éleveur la fréquence plus élevée du raclage permet d’améliorer la propreté des bâtiments et donc la santé des animaux. « Avec les robots de traite les vaches sont de plus en plus à l’étable et pour avoir une bonne fréquentation il faut favoriser la circulation et donc avoir des sols propres » souligne André Pot chez Delaval.

Le raclage automatique du fumier moins vulgarisé

Même si la tendance des nouvelles installations s’oriente clairement en faveur des systèmes lisier le raclage du fumier reste encore présent dans beaucoup de bâtiments. Le raclage du fumier est moins fréquent (2 fois par jour) pour conserver la consistance du produit et nécessite souvent une reprise en bout de bâtiment. Son intérêt de l’automatiser est donc moindre comparativement à un système lisier. Il impose l’utilisation d’un racleur lourd en forme de V ou en U. Au niveau de l’entraînement les racleurs hydrauliques gourmands en énergie laissent la place à des systèmes électriques à chaîne. La puissance demandée reste importante. « Il faut 2 à 25 kW en fumier quand 05 à 1 kW suffit en lisier » illustre Nicolas Canteneur directeur général de Miro seul constructeur à proposer un robot capable de racler du fumier. « Notre Mirobot est souvent utilisé en conditions mixtes associant des couloirs en lisier et des zones paillées. »

Les robots racleurs plébiscités sur les caillebotis

En système lisier la concurrence entre racleurs automatiques et robots de raclage est plus marquée. « Le gros avantage des robots est qu’ils peuvent intervenir dans les zones intermédiaires comme les passages entre les logettes et les aires d’attente reconnaît Bertrand Fagoo de l’Institut de l’élevage. Ils demandent moins d’aménagements (pas de bordure à créer ou de canal central à creuser) pour leur installation et du fait de leur largeur réduite ils sont également moins sensibles aux irrégularités du sol. »

Dans les élevages sur caillebotis les robots racleurs ont fait leurs preuves et leur relative simplicité les rend très compétitifs en termes de coût d’investissement face aux racleurs légers à corde habituellement proposés pour ce type de sol quand il s’agit de racler deux couloirs. « En revanche la technologie engendrera davantage de coûts de fonctionnement dans le temps. »

Les robots arrivent aussi sur sols pleins

Dans le cas des sols pleinscomparativement au racleur à corde. « On a encore peu de recul sur la durée de vie et le vieillissement de ces automates. Contrairement aux simples robots racleurs pour caillebotis ils sont plus complexes techniquement et imposent davantage de contraintes.ce qui peut impliquer la présence d’une préfosse avec homogénéisation et pompe de reprise du lisier avertit Bertrand Fagoo. Cela impose un surcoût très important (30 000 à 50 000 euros) comparativement à un déversement direct en fosse ou par gravité via un canal à lisier. Toutefois le préstockage et la reprise sont parfois également nécessaires avec des racleurs pour les grands troupeaux ou quand il est impossible de construire une fosse enterrée à proximité du bâtiment. »

Les robots pour sols pleins sont plus ou moins compatibles avec des lisiers chargés. Les modèles dits « préleveurs » ou « collecteurs » (Joz Barn-e ou Delaval Robot Collect) acceptent jusqu’à 15 kg de paille (brins jusqu’à 6 cm) par logette et par jour tandis que les robots aspirateurs (Lely Discovery Collector et CRD Aspi Concept) ne tolèrent la paille qu’en farine à de faibles doses. Ces automates demeurent donc peu compatibles avec des logettes profondes ou avec des matelas chargés de litière pour améliorer le confort.

Les robots ont d’autres avantages par rapport aux racleurs. Ils ne créent pas de vague de lisier qui peut déranger des vaches et souiller leurs pattes. Leur trajet configurable à souhait permet de s’adapter aux écarts de salissement des différentes zones du bâtiment.

Le racleur à corde fait de la résistance

Face à la montée en puissance des robots les racleurs sont encore bien présents. « Dans les bâtiments très ventilés et en période de fortes chaleurs les racleurs tirent leur épingle du jeu face aux robots grâce à leur poids supérieur permettant de venir plus facilement à bout du lisier séché sans devoir arroser » relève André Pot. Le racleur droit est le plus courant en lisier. Il est de plus en plus souvent associé à des brosses. « Attention à les nettoyer régulièrement pour qu’elles conservent leur efficacité » prévient Nicolas Canteneur. Les racleurs à corde semblent prendre l’avantage sur les modèles à chaîne ou à câble. « La corde est plus facile à réparer et ne devient pas blessante pour les animaux quand elle s’use contrairement au câble. » Outre une largeur de couloir minimale (45 m à l’auge et 3 à 35 m pour les autres couloirs) Bertrand Fagoo préconise d’avoir deux couloirs de même longueur pour limiter les coûts. « Au-delà de 70 à 90 mètres de long il faut parfois un collecteur intermédiaire pour limiter la vague. Il est aussi préférable de faire débuter le racleur près des robots de traite. »",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vdWVzdC1mcmFuY2UuZnIvZXVyb3BlL3VrcmFpbmUvdm9sb2R5bXlyLXplbGVuc2t5L2d1ZXJyZS1lbi11a3JhaW5lLW5vbi12b2xvZHlteXItemVsZW5za3ktbi1hLXBhcy1hcHBlbGUtYS10dWVyLXVuLXBhci11bi1sZXMtcnVzc2VzLWRmMTkwYjNlLTQzZjktMTFlZC05ZjhmLTNhNGVhMmQxOTY0MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Guerre en Ukraine.

Alexis Kohler le secrétaire général de l'Élysée a été mis en examen pour prise illégale d'intérêt ce lundi. Le parquet national financier lui reproche de ne pas avoir déclaré ses liens avec la famille Aponte le principal actionnaire de l'opérateur maritime MSC. Et ce alors qu'il a pris part à des négociations avec l'entreprise au nom de l'État.

""Vice président""

Mais du côté du palais la confiance est de mise. L'Élysée assure qu'Alexis Kohler ne démissionnera pas et qu'il garde la confiance du chef de l'État. Sa mise en examen n'est que la suite logique d'une affaire en cours depuis 2018 explique un conseiller à Europe 1.

Et jusqu'ici cette procédure ne l'a pas empêché de travailler ajoute-t-il. Autrement dit pour l'exécutif la mise en examen d'Alexis Kohler ne changera rien et le président ne compte absolument pas se séparer de son plus proche collaborateur surnommé par certains ""le vice président"" tant il contrôle gouverne et arbitre toutes les décisions de l'État.

Des dégâts dans l'opinion publique ?

Au lendemain de sa réélection Emmanuel Macron n'avait d'ailleurs pas tenu compte des avertissements de certains de ses proches qui lui a conseillé de ne pas reconduire Alexis Kohler comme secrétaire général de l'Élysée pour ne pas que son pouvoir soit déstabilisé par d'éventuelles poursuites de la justice.

Sur le plan politique le président assume donc son choix jusqu'au bout de se comporter comme s'il n'y avait pas d'affaire. Il démontre une certaine cohérence puisqu'il a toujours répété qu'il ne se laisserait pas dicter son agenda par la pression des juges et des médias. La contrepartie c'est qu'il prend le risque de provoquer des dégâts dans l'opinion en alimentant le sentiment de défiance des Français envers la classe politique.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZXF1aXBlLmZyL1Rlbm5pcy1kZS10YWJsZS9BY3R1YWxpdGVzL0wtZXF1aXBlLWRlLWZyYW5jZS1mZW1pbmluZS1kZS10ZW5uaXMtZGUtdGFibGUtZW4taHVpdGllbWVzLWRlLWZpbmFsZS1kZXMtbW9uZGlhdXgvMTM1NzQxN9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,L'équipe de France féminine de tennis de table en huitièmes de finale des Mondiaux,L'équipe de France féminine de tennis de table a remporté mardi sa dernière rencontre de poule face au Brésil (3-2) s'assurant ainsi la deuxième place du groupe derrière Hongkong et une qualification pour les huitièmes de finale des Mondiaux par équipes.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYXJ0c2luZnJhbmNlLm5ldC9WZWdlZHJlYW0vbmV3cy0xMjI2NjYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Après son agression Vegedream donne sa version des faits et pousse un coup de gueule,"Crédits photo : Bestimage

Open Extended Reactions

Bill Belichick and Robert Kraft were front and center Sunday in what appeared to be a happy reunion during the live roast of Tom Brady.

But according to two former players who attended the roast the former New England Patriots coach and the longtime team owner also shared some awkward moments offstage.

Julian Edelman and Drew Bledsoe discussed the three-hour roast during the latest episode of Edelman's ""Games with Names"" podcast and described the scene in the green room before the event.

""Preshow we're in the green room -- remember that? Were you in there?"" Edelman asked Bledsoe. ""Bill's opening up. He's having fun he's talking war stories talking rookie skits talking fun s--- doing s--- we know what Bill's all about but it was like amplified because he was excited to see you guys because he doesn't have a job anymore.""

Edelman and Bledsoe said they were both in the green room with Belichick along with former Patriots stars Rob Gronkowski and Randy Moss when Kraft arrived.

""Then Kraft walks in ... Belichick's kind of holding court"" Bledsoe recalled. ""As he's in the middle of the story Kraft walks in and so you guys all go over to say hi to Kraft.""

""The tension in that room though could cut f---ing glass"" Edelman said.

Edelman said he tried to give Belichick a ""head's up"" when he saw Kraft walk into the green room but that Belichick did not pick up on the cue.

""[Kraft] came in and I was like 'Oh s--- there's gonna be some fireworks'"" Edelman said. ""I just walked away. I didn't want to get in there.""

Bledsoe added that Belichick and Kraft did at one point ""break it down and got together for I don't know 10 minutes at least."" But the former Patriots quarterback agreed with Edelman's assessment about the tension in the room saying ""it was very real it was very real.""

Belichick and Kraft drank a shot together on stage at one point with some coaxing from comedian Kevin Hart during Sunday's made-for-streaming live comedy show on Netflix titled ""The Greatest Roast of All Time.""

Belichick left the Patriots in January after 24 seasons with the team and there has been reported friction between the six-time Super Bowl-winning coach and Kraft over the past couple of years.

As part of an ESPN report published last month that detailed Belichick's departure from the Patriots and his inability to land the Atlanta Falcons' head-coaching job a source said Kraft called Falcons owner Arthur Blank ""to warn him not to trust Bill.""

The Falcons interviewed Belichick twice this offseason for their vacant head-coaching position before ultimately hiring Raheem Morris for the job.

After joking about the event being like a reunion and that ""unlike many family reunions there are some people I am desperately trying to avoid"" Kraft praised Belichick for what the two accomplished.

""I want to say this is the greatest coach in the history of the game that did what no one else has done. And having Tom Brady and him was the greatest honor the good Lord gave me"" Kraft said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvY2xpbWF0ZS90cnVtcC1vaWwtZ2FzLW1hci1hLWxhZ28uaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,At a Dinner Trump Assailed Climate Rules and Asked $1 Billion From Big Oil,"Former President Donald J. Trump told a group of oil executives and lobbyists gathered at a dinner at his Mar-a-Lago resort last month that they should donate $1 billion to his presidential campaign because if elected he would roll back environmental rules that he said hampered their industry according to two people who were there.

About 20 people attended an April 11 event billed as an “energy round table” at Mr. Trump’s private club according to those people who asked not to be identified in order to discuss the private event. Attendees included executives from ExxonMobil EQT Corporation and the American Petroleum Institute which lobbies for the oil industry.

The event was organized by the oil billionaire Harold Hamm who has for years helped to shape Republican energy policies. It was first reported by The Washington Post.

Mr. Trump has publicly railed for months against President Biden’s energy and environmental agenda as Mr. Biden has raced to restore and strengthen dozens of climate and conservation rules that Mr. Trump had weakened or erased while in office. In particular Mr. Trump has promised to eliminate Mr. Biden’s new climate rules intended to accelerate the nation’s transition to electric vehicles and to push a “drill baby drill” agenda aimed at opening up more public lands to oil and gas exploration.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvYm9laW5nLWpldC1za2lkcy1vZmYtcnVud2F5LWluanVyaW5nLWF0LWxlYXN0LTEw0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9ib2VpbmctamV0LXNraWRzLW9mZi1ydW53YXktaW5qdXJpbmctYXQtbGVhc3QtMTAuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing jet skids off runway injuring at least 10,"A Boeing 737 skidded off a runway at an airport in Senegal’s capital injuring at least 11 people and grounding all operations while crew assisted with an evacuation of the aircraft.

The plane in question was first delivered 30 years ago to Romanian company TAROM before TransAir leased it starting this year according to Plane Spotters. The plane had previously suffered a tail issue during takeoff but returned to service a month later.

Leo Lukenas III a former Green Beret who was part of the bank’s Financial Institutions Group died of “acute coronary artery thrombus” at age 35 last Thursday according to a Reuters report.

He leaves behind a wife and two young children.

His death came after he had allegedly been working some 100 hours a week for several weeks in a row on a $2 billion merger that was completed last Monday — three days before his tragic death.

Much of the outcry on social media site Reddit from purported bank staffers has been directed at Lukenas’ boss Gary Howe co-head of the financial institutions group. Howe took down his LinkedIn page during the last few days.

Some employees have reportedly messaged each other about a possible walkout in an effort to bargain for better working conditions according to popular financial website and chat board Wall Street Oasis.

One post from an anonymous banker highlighted a list of demands for employees’ welfare that generated more than 450 comments in response.

The demands include “proactive policies” that cap work schedules at an average of 80 hours over a seven-day period and that employees get at least one weekend off per month. It also called for an investigation into Lukenas’ death.

So far workers have remained at their desks — in part because they fear retribution for raising concerns about the toxic culture sources said.

A Bank of America spokesperson did not comment about a possible walkout or the accusations of retribution when reached by The Post.

The rep said the bank has no plans to take any action against Howe or to investigate complaints that its junior bankers are forced to put in 100-hour weeks.

“We are very saddened by the loss of our teammate. We continue to focus on doing whatever we can to support the family and our team especially those who worked closely with him” the BoA spokesperson told The Post.

Howe did not reply to multiple requests for comment.

Lukena who lived in Brooklyn had been a Green Beret for more than a decade — from 2013 until he joined the bank as a full-time employee last July — according to his LinkedIn page.

He posted news about the deal between UMB Financial and Heartland Financial on LinkedIn days before his death.

He was a member of 51 Vets a nonprofit dedicated to connecting transitioning and transitioned veterans from elite military communities with leading businesses according to its website.

“51 Vets completely changed the trajectory of my post military career. Outstanding organization with an incredible mission” Lukenas had recently posted on LinkedIn.

A fundraiser for his family launched by 51 Vets has already raised $258962 as of early Thursday afternoon including $10000 from hedge fund titan Bill Ackman.

“This was an organic campaign organized by our members” 51 Vets founder Jordan Selleck told The Post.

“This speaks to the pain in the veteran community and Leo’s reputation in the community.”

“On May 2nd 2024 51 Vets lost a father husband son Green Beret and member” 51 Vets says on its site.

“Leo left behind a wife and two young children. Leo spent over a decade in Army Special Operations deploying multiple times with 1st Special Forces Group. He was dedicated to everything he did never settling for good enough. He always set the example and held himself to the highest standards prioritizing the team and mission success over himself.”

Lukenas’ dedication to work is why some on Wall Street are quick to link his passing to a culture they believe values wealth over well-being.

While there is no direct evidence to suggest his work had anything to do with his death numerous studies have linked acute stress to thrombosis.

Lukenas’ shocking death reopened a longstanding debate on Wall Street about a bank’s responsibility to employees.

More than a decade ago Moritz Erhardt a 21-year-old intern at Bank of America in London died after working until 6 a.m. three nights in a row.

A coroner concluded that Erhardt’s death from an epileptic seizure that limited his oxygen supply may have been triggered by fatigue.

Following his death banks made an effort to restrict employee work hours.

That discussion was reignited in 2021 after a PowerPoint presentation compiled by 13 Goldman Sachs junior bankers and calling out brutal workweeks leaked to the popular Wall Street influencer Litquidity.

“What is not ok to me is 110-120 hours over the course of a week! The math is simple that leaves 4 hours for eating sleeping showering bathroom and general transition time. This is beyond the level of ‘hard-working’ it is inhuman/ abuse” one analyst wrote at the time.

In response banks began hiring more staff to lighten junior employees’ workloads and limit hours.

But over the last year as Wall Street profits dropped and firms prepared for a possible recession several banks — including Bank of America — cut the workforce once again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbGlzaC5jb20vZm9vZC1uZXdzL2E2MDc0NDU5NS90cmF2aXMta2VsY2UtY2xhaW1zLWFsd2F5cy1kcnVuay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Travis Kelce Is Clapping Back At Claims He's 'Always Drunk',"Earlier this week country singer and actor Jana Kramer took to her podcast to well slander Travis Kelce's name. The iHeart Radio host dissed the Kansas City Chiefs tight end for his drinking habits and claimed he's ""always drunk."" Now Kelce is hitting back via multiple insiders.

""He was taken aback as he’s never met her and is just living his life"" the source told Page Six while ""emphatically"" denying any suggestion the athlete has a drinking problem. ""That guy is under a microscope basically being watched everywhere he goes. Of course you're going to see him drinking"" the source said.

Kramer even took aim at Kelce's influence on his girlfriend Taylor Swift arguing that he has encouraged the singer's consumption habits.

""I see her drinking more now. Like the company you keep"" Kramer alleged while also calling Kelce out for his ""aggression"" with coach Andy Reid during the Super Bowl. It ""rubbed [her] the wrong way.""

The same insider went on to argue that if Kelce did have a drinking problem it would be impossible to hide given his status and constant

""It’s not like he’s passed out somewhere. If he was passed out somewhere I would totally understand but that’s not the case whatsoever"" the source adds while noting that he's just a ""normal human being"" who is ""doing the same thing"" as everyone else...only ""in the public eye.""

The three-time Super Bowl champ is reportedly ""in training right now"" to prepare for another season with the Chiefs. ""If he was drunk it would be a bigger problem"" the source said.

This isn't the first time Kelce has come under fire for drinking. During his honorary graduation ceremony for his ""New Heights"" podcast Travis accepted the diploma he never picked up in the first place before chugging a beer in celebration. However big brother Jason was quick to his defense.

""I know it looks like a graduation from the video but this was actually at the end of a New Heights Live podcast that we put on to raise money for the University’s NIL"" the older Kelce said according to People Magazine. ""The university did this to poke fun at my brother and I for never really picking up our diplomas."""

AEC Magazine’s very own hobbit Martyn Day examines what this could mean for future design workflows Revit and other applications

For many years AEC magazine has been pondering what comes next for Autodesk as the company has long stated its objective to move from desktop applications to the cloud. Revit is such an important BIM application for the AEC industry. But it has suffered from a lack of development for so long. It seemed that Autodesk did not want to redevelop the 20-year old application despite complaints and frustrations from a broad range of AEC firms. Indeed there have now been two ‘open letters’ from customers and architectural associations trying to find out what the future of their core application will be.

If there were to be no second generation of Revit what would replace it? At Autodesk University this year Autodesk might not have explicitly given a definitive explanation but at least it chose to give its customers the destination.

Autodesk CEO Andrew Anagnost during his keynote address at Autodesk University 2021 requested that users do not get too attached to their desktop brands. He placed some very subtle hints about how in the future Autodesk software would rely on its impressive range of Forge cloud services moving the company’s development tech stack gradually from desktops to the cloud. Last week at Autodesk University 2022 Anagnost gave the audience Autodesk’s future vision for the convergence of the next generation of design tools.

Autodesk Platform

In his keynote Anagnost explained that Autodesk is developing cloud ‘platforms’ based on a set of common services. There will be three cloud platforms specific to different industries – Forma for AEC Fusion for manufacturing and Flow for media and entertainment. These platforms will aim to connect the tools data processing and workflows for every phase of Autodesk’s customers’ projects.

These industry ‘clouds’ take Autodesk from providing point solutions like Revit to delivering cloud environments to streamline workflows and span the full lifecycle from concept to operation. In the case of Autodesk Forma for AEC this would be early-stage design to digital twins.

Autodesk’s Platforms have two essential components: a Unified Database and what were branded as Forge components. The Forge platform itself was rebranded Autodesk Platform Services (APS) which was a bit of a surprise given the years of marketing and branding that Autodesk had given the initiative. APS is a suite of interoperable cloud services that provide building blocks to create applications workflows and integrations.

Autodesk indicated that the process of building and moving to these new platforms will take three to five years but a lot of the foundational work has been done through the creation and development of what was Forge.

Autodesk’s applications will at first plug into Autodesk Forma together with a raft of connectors for third-party products and data in a wide variety of formats which will enable data exchange. Autodesk was particularly hyping its new connector to McNeel Rhino and has endorsed USD and IFC as open formats it will support.

Quantum > Plasma > Forma

Autodesk’s Platform vision is not new. In 2016 the company unveiled Project Quantum a centralised cloud-based common data environment which ‘connects workspaces by breaking down the monolithic nature of typical AEC solutions.’ This data-centric approach to software was aimed at breaking down the silos and connecting design with manufacturing. Quantum was set to bring new life to Revit by offloading the Revit database to the cloud meaning huge files would not need to be shunted around. After Amar Hanspal (co-CEO of Autodesk) left Quantum kind of went dark.

For many the path of least resistance may lead them to go with the flow and drift into Autodesk’s cloud utopia. However others may be more sceptical.

Under the then new CEO Andrew Anagnost Quantum which was once described as ‘little more than a Powerpoint’ became Project Plasma in 2019. It transpired that what the AEC team had been working on was something that other Autodesk divisions felt they needed too so it moved from being a division-specific technology to something much more foundational.

Back then AEC Magazine got a little insight into what Autodesk’s development team was planning. The idea was that Revit should not be the co-ordination point for all AEC data but this should be happening back on the cloud. Plasma was to be the single version of the truth.

Having decided on a data-centric approach and a single unified database the work was to then define this functioning data layer / schema. Given the plan was to be a single version of the truth and to be able to take design data from concept through manufacture and operation one can only imagine the complexity involved in that. On top of that Autodesk would want to keep its desktop products alive while it moved everything to the cloud. Meanwhile Autodesk was learning a lot about cloud-based design apps through its Fusion 360 manufacturing design application.

Autodesk Forma is the culmination of this data-centric work and has been years in the making. First openly discussed in 2016 it now looks like we might see it become a reality sometime between 2025 and 2028.

The aim is to have a centralised cloud repository connected to all data consumers in a project – giving them the right tools and latest data in whatever way they need. This breaks down silos of data which are inherent in the industry but more specifically between Autodesk’s own applications.

From apps to tech stacks

Today design IT directors and BIM managers define their own technology stacks for the businesses they run. This varies from firm to firm but in the UK and US a sizeable chunk may well be the Autodesk AEC Collection for authoring perhaps BIM360 / Docs as well but the glue repositories Common Data Environments (CDEs) exchange tools renderers document management email etc. will have been tested and pieced together.

With Forma Autodesk is looking to offer a turnkey tech stack located in its proprietary cloud with all Autodesk’s tools from concept (FormIT) to Digital Twin (Tandem). Through its own in-house developed connectors non-Autodesk products (Rhino SketchUp etc.) can be linked to the Forma common database where the data should seamlessly flow between apps. As Forma is cloud and other software providers are also moving that way there will also be API access.

Forma is a cage but a multi-platform multi-device gilded cage. There are clear benefits to integrated seamless workflows. For design IT directors Forma could simplify and single-source a lot of capabilities which are bought in from other vendors. Existing essential apps like Rhino can be integrated and workflows could provide automation of data flow to analysis tools like Spacemaker collaborative VR tools like The Wild or clash reports sent to project managers. This will accelerate the death of file-based workflows and users will benefit from a connected world of applications.

Questions questions questions

If we wake up from the dream of tech stack utopia for one minute Forma does open up all sorts of questions: how much will it cost and will you be trapped if you decide you want to leave?

From talking with the Open Letter Group they estimated only 10% of their Autodesk Collections were ever installed (the core products were AutoCAD Revit Navisworks and 3ds Max). What will be the deal with Forma? Will it be a separate server like product in addition to Collections or as the applications slowly become absorbed into Forma does it replace Collections? What features will have additional transactional fees paid for with ‘Tokens’? And by using tokens in a contained collaborative supply chain is it moral to monetise the data the customer owns?

Will all the Autodesk applications and workflows really be best in class? Or will firms still have to build their own mix of tools and workflows with Forma just as a tech stack block?

Do practices actually want to retain control over their own tech stacks with today’s pick and mix approach? Even with the hassle of managing products on different development cycles different interfaces integration issues etc?

For many the path of least resistance may lead them to go with the flow and drift into Autodesk’s cloud utopia. However others may be more sceptical. Many of the firms we talk to have ongoing trust issues with Autodesk with fears of escalating costs of ownership audits tokens and products which fail to meet expectation or lose product development velocity.

As to cost it’s hard to imagine Autodesk reducing how much it charges customers today. With Autodesk hoping to show major productivity benefits over old school file-based workflows Forma could cost more. With this move lowering data friction there is a new Return on Investment to be considered.

In a sense Forma is a play to own and extend the collaborative process of design as well as the network of all project data. Autodesk wants to be at the very heart of that process within companies.

All roads lead to Rome

With Forma Autodesk now talks of openness and connectors seemingly with great passion. There are many Common Data Environments (CDEs) from many different developers but these usually view collated data search for clashes reviews etc. Having banned Revizto from this year’s Autodesk University I get the feeling Autodesk wants its cloud environment to be the one in which all project data is imported for collation checking AI analysis / processing and documentation. To do this it needs to be able to suck in data from many other sources and bring it together in a coherent workspace.

To some extent this competes with the Nvidia Omniverse platform which takes a ‘bring your own app’ approach to sharing geometry into a graphics-accelerated environment. While the system is based on the open USD format Nvidia is managing to scrape out additional BIM information from the applications it plugs into. Nvidia is also making some headway into getting developers to create AEC tools which sit within Omniverse and utilise Nvidia’s GPUs to process geometry. There is an interesting layer of co-opetition overlap between Autodesk and Nvidia here.

Revit’s Forma future?

In the last issue of AEC Magazine we reported on a second ‘open letter’ this time from the Nordic countries’ architectural associations. Some of Autodesk’s most mature and famous architectural customers complained at the lack of development of Revit. This has led to a planned meeting between Autodesk representatives and the letter writers in Norway next month to discuss the key issues raised.

While there has been no public response from Autodesk to the letter architect and journalist Anthony Frausto-Robledo of Architosh covered some of the topics raised in an exclusive interview with Autodesk CEO Andrew Anagnost.

In the article Anagnost dropped the news about Forma and addressed how this will impact the future of Revit. He doubled down on his statements made two years ago to the original open letter – there is no next generation Revit.

He also admitted that even though current Revit will go on being developed “Not everything in Revit can be fixed.”

The future of Revit is to be hooked up to Autodesk Forma where Spacemaker will be used for conceptual design with data flowing to Revit for detail design and documentation. Over time Forma will slowly absorb the detail design capabilities which Revit does now but according to Anagnost it will be “reimagined in terms of an outcome-based machine-generated paradigm.”

Shockingly Anagnost then went on to say: “If you want a faster horse you might not want to work with us because we will not make a faster horse. But we can be that partner and tool provider that supports professionals into the new era of architecture.”

I relayed that statement to several Open Letter writing Revit customers and that message went down like a cup of cold sick. Frustrated Revit users seem to fall into one of two camps: fix what we have or build us a next generation. To those ears Autodesk’s Forma solution to the BIM issue might sound like we are going to build you an aardvark (insert random animal of choice) instead.

As to the ‘faster horse’ analogy it really depends how you unpick it. Personally I infer that this means Autodesk recognises that Revit as it is is the ‘horse’ the old technology while the future is an electric car not a faster horse. Forma is the electric car but it’s a long way away. If all the engineering investment will be years of integrating and digesting current Revit into Forma when can users hope for its design capabilities be expanded? Spacemaker is not Revit.

There is a lot to unpack from the Architosh article.

Revit’s most capable mature users have run out of runway with the product and feel that Autodesk up until now has been less than explicit on what the future of Revit will be. These firms have heavily invested in skills hardware and third-party products to base not only their BIM strategies but also their businesses on this one core Autodesk product.

Costs of ownership is a major concern and the product development had stalled. When they did complain development restarted but most of the features they asked for have yet to come out. ‘The needs of the many outweighed the needs of the few’ they were told as low hanging fruit enhancements appear to have been prioritised. While many of the letter writers started this journey as Revit fan boys none really wanted to hear that their BIM tool was going to suffer the fate of death by slow absorption even though they knew no second generation was in the works.

All Autodesk customers are now on an unexpected journey — Autodesk’s quest to deliver the next generation tools via the cloud. Let’s hope they don’t stray into Mordor along the way

At least at AU 2022 Autodesk detailed the company’s tech stack destination and now Anagnost has clearly stated that Revit will be hooked up to Forma eventually being absorbed on a time scale in years. And for those who want more advanced features these will be delivered in Forma as opposed to the current Revit on the desktop.

There are going to be many firms that will be going along and seeing what happens but given the timescale involved and their urgent need to improve and refine their design processes some are going to re-evaluate the market. The Open Letter Groups are working on building a specification of what next generation design tools need to be able to do. This will be a handy crib sheet for new and existing software developers to better meet the needs of the industry.

Conclusion

It has been a long time in coming but Autodesk has finally given its users the destination where all this rearchitecting development work has been heading. In all it seems like this will be a ten-year quest of Autodesk’s with lots of heavy lifting still to be done before Autodesk reaches its new shire.

Autodesk’s divisions are all at different stages of getting there with Manufacturing being the most advanced having had one of its core tools written as a cloud application (Fusion 360).

The AEC division’s journey has been a little more fraught with its core tools – AutoCAD and Revit – having been mainly in stasis while Construction Cloud in 2019 was Autodesk’s first cloud service offering. The journey for the design tools seems to have started around 2020 when Autodesk acquired Norwegian developer Spacemaker. The company’s development team and conceptual product seem to have completely enamoured Autodesk’s management. It has taken two years to rewrite Spacemaker and integrate it with Revit forming a key building block of Forma.

For those that feel trapped in the proprietary file formats and tools of Autodesk I am not sure how they will look upon Forma. It’s a lot more Autodesk not less. Autodesk needs to prove that their openness talk is not ‘openwash’ and that connectors give good file output in both directions. Connectors need to be two way and there needs to be a clear way to get your data out should you want to leave.

It’s interesting to look at other industries like media and entertainment where the popularity of open formats such as USD has meant there is a bridge for the geometry and materials information to flow between all the various software developer’s applications. The need for a ‘single platform to rule them all’ is much less valid. Vendors have to compete on capabilities not on being the proprietary format which holds all the data. The work being done by Greg Schleusner at HOK is looking for an open bridge format that

can do the same for AEC. Watch his talk from AEC Magazine’s NXT BLD 2022.

Pricing will always be an issue as will in-app purchases with tokens as well as control of licences. Here Autodesk’s long-term relationships with customers and their historic experiences will be key. Any past moves which have damaged trust or invoked fear of non-compliance fines may make it difficult to persuade the company has changed. Given desktop applications will continue for years into the future alongside these cloud platforms I don’t think non-compliance and audits are going away anytime soon.

As to Revit we now know it will be eventually absorbed into Forma and we will see individual applications appear probably based on discipline. I assume these will still be branded Revit. The biggest performance update to come before that happens will be the introduction of Autodesk’s One Graphics System – which we will report on in a future issue. Revit is what it is and you either accept it together with the roadmap of what’s coming or you don’t and start looking around for an alternative. I am sure Autodesk in the coming months and years will flesh out Forma’s value offerings but I am now expecting parallel development with Revit for an extended period of time.

It’s still too early to know what new capabilities Forma will offer architectural designers. Spacemaker is being highlighted for now but also new levels of process automation and AI.

From this year’s AU all Autodesk customers are now on an unexpected journey — Autodesk’s quest to deliver the next generation tools via the cloud. Let’s hope they don’t stray into Mordor along the way.

The Cloud utopia

Initially the cloud was sold to us as ‘Infinite Computing’ and that it would mean cheaper access to applications. The reality is that subscriptions increase the cost of ownership and infinite computing isn’t cheap – after all you are paying to use someone else’s computer.

At the time talking with Autodesk’s then CEO Carl Bass he explained how in computing whenever there was a change in platform software companies’ fortunes would rise and fall.

If a software firm dominated on DOS it didn’t mean it would necessarily do the same in Windows. Anyone still got a copy of Wordstar?

The same was true of RISC processors to Intel. Looking ahead the industry has mutually decided that this next hurdle was going to be cloud. Autodesk was certainly amongst the first in CAD to switch around its development to a cloud first mentality but unlike previous platform changes this one seems to be taking place a lot slower than was originally thought.

The trouble was that not all applications lent themselves to cloud-architectures and the technology that was available in those early days was too immature to handle graphics performant tasks. However technology is in a constant state of development and the kinks are being ironed out.

Autodesk has maintained its desktop design applications and augmented them with cloud services. It created its first pure cloud design application Fusion 360 which was aimed to take on the aging solid modelling tool Solidworks. Despite breakneck development an extraordinary sales push and a price of $50 a month Fusion 360 has failed to make a significant dent on sales of Solidworks or other competitors. The cloud was not going to be reason enough for users to desert their desktop applications overnight. Just because something was on the cloud was not a compelling feature in and of itself. The real power of the cloud comes with seamless collaboration the removal of files and interconnectivity not so much the design tool.

Autodesk has suffered from having multiple applications which have been acquired or internally developed with many user interfaces file formats and workflows. The variety within the AEC collection is testament to that. Forma presents Autodesk with the opportunity to harmonise the data formats and user interfaces. So this is a giant opportunity to deliver coherence at last.

Autodesk sees that its Platform solutions will serve to connect people process and data with the possibility to automate processes and extend data to other business critical systems. Using open APIs there is a chance to work alongside other vendors’ products and cloud services.

Beyond connectivity a granular unified database (generally called an ECS – Entity Component System) can at the core finally remove the limitations and danger of relying on files and the real-time nature of connection means there will be improvement in collaboration. Many of today’s codified standards by which industries work hark back to the days of pen and paper which defined the limitations of submission stages. These best practices do not apply well to modern cloud-based teams.

Additionally Autodesk highlights the resilience and security of hosting its code and customers’ data on Amazon Web Services potentially taking the load off your in-house IT.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdlb3dlZWtuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL25ldy1jb2xsYWJvcmF0aW9uLWFubm91bmNlZC1iZXR3ZWVuLWF1dG9kZXNrLWFuZC1lcGljLWdhbWVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Collaboration Announced Between Autodesk And Epic Games,"New Collaboration Announced Between Autodesk And Epic Games

The integration between Revit and Twinmotion allows for highly-realistic and interactive 3D visualizations.

Recent years have seen an explosion in the quality of 3D graphics and other tools that allow for 3D visualization leading to greater demand from a wide range of industries that may not necessarily be regularly associated with the technology. Of course not every industry and company has the capacity to become experts in the space leading to partnerships between organizations that even 10 or 20 years ago would never have been considered natural fits.

A lot of that revolves around the gaming industry who has been working successfully with constantly-evolving levels of 3D graphics for decades now with Epic Games and their Unreal Engine being at the center of a lot of it. Earlier this year they introduced an integration with Esri and their ArcGIS platform putting them in the GIS space. More recently they’ve announced a further development in an ongoing partnership with software company Autodesk providing their expertise to the AEC industry.

With this new strategic collaboration users of Autodesk Revit the BIM software for AEC teams will now have free access to Epic Games’ visualization tool Twinmotion. Autodesk has said that Twinmotion will be available to all Revit customers soon as part of an forthcoming release for the product. By utilizing this new integration Revit users can take their plans and designs from Autodesk’s platform and easily transfer them into Twinmotion where they can create highly accurate visualizations of their planned space.

From Twinmotion users will also have access to the Epic ecosystem including a recent release for the program which allows for images and videos to be rendered at resolutions up to 64K as well as a new integration with modeling platform Sketchfab. They’ll also have access to MetaHuman to easily create digital humans plus a massive library of realistic 3D scans from Quixel Megascans all of which can be populated within the design.

This kind of collaboration has the potential to change the game in terms of visualization for designers of spaces ranging from a single building to much larger scales. Although it was certainly possible before this to see a 3D representation of a potential design bringing in plans developed within Revit to Twinmotion ensures the accuracy from the former and combines hyper-realistic graphics and a massive number of potential assets that can be imported into the space from the latter.

Users even have access to RealityScan which allows one to create their own 3D model if an asset does not already exist in the database. Now not only can you see an accurate representation of a new building or complex but that visualization can be updated to see what it looks like when populated by people with various plants and trees around the space different lighting options and even what the space looks like at various times of day with realistic sunlight simulations. All of this will not only improve visualization but should also improve ability to win bids by showing off these detailed and realistic to potential customers.

While the ability to represent 2D CAD designs in three dimensions is not exactly a new capability for Revit users this level of customization and visualization brings the tool to a new level for one of the most used programs in the AEC designing and planning space. These models will be highly interactive as well and can be used for anything ranging from stills to animations and even to be utilized in immersive virtual reality (VR) settings. Having this integration as a free perk will save Revit users $499 the normal price for Twinmotion for those in a commercial setting.

These kinds of partnerships between graphics companies and those in the AEC space will only continue to become more commonplace as 3D visualization becomes a more ubiquitous part of our daily experience especially as we get closer to fully realizing the metaverse. In fact this won’t be the last collaboration between Epic and Autodesk who plan to also develop similar tools for those in the M&E and manufacturing sectors.

On this partnership Epic Games Vice President Unreal Engine Ecosystem Marc Petit said “We share a common goal with Autodesk giving customers more time to be innovative. By tapping into Epic’s ecosystem of real-time 3D tools and libraries creatives can spend more time bringing their designs to life and less time stumbling over complex data and technical workflows."" Autodesk Executive Vice President of AEC Design Amy Bunszel added “Together with Epic Games we will expand on what’s possible. In immersive environments designers can communicate to their project teams and clients with unparalleled realism how projects will look and feel upon completion for better decision-making and outcomes.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZ2luZWVyaW5nLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zY2huZWlkZXItZWxlY3RyaWMtbGF1bmNoZXMtcmV2aXQtZXh0ZW5zaW9uLWZvci1lbGVjdHJpY2FsLWRlc2lnbi1hdC1hdS0yMDIy0gEtaHR0cHM6Ly9tb2JpbGUuZW5naW5lZXJpbmcuY29tL2FtcC8yNjYxMC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Schneider Electric Launches Revit Extension for Electrical Design at AU 2022,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZ2luZWVyaW5nLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zY2huZWlkZXItZWxlY3RyaWMtbGF1bmNoZXMtcmV2aXQtZXh0ZW5zaW9uLWZvci1lbGVjdHJpY2FsLWRlc2lnbi1hdC1hdS0yMDIy0gEtaHR0cHM6Ly9tb2JpbGUuZW5naW5lZXJpbmcuY29tL2FtcC8yNjYxMC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC8573E50>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZ2luZWVyaW5nLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zY2huZWlkZXItZWxlY3RyaWMtbGF1bmNoZXMtcmV2aXQtZXh0ZW5zaW9uLWZvci1lbGVjdHJpY2FsLWRlc2lnbi1hdC1hdS0yMDIy0gEtaHR0cHM6Ly9tb2JpbGUuZW5naW5lZXJpbmcuY29tL2FtcC8yNjYxMC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9kZXNrLmNvbS9ibG9ncy9jb25zdHJ1Y3Rpb24vc3VwcG9ydGluZy13b21lbi1jb25zdHJ1Y3Rpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Supporting Women in Construction Is About Much More than Diversity,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9kZXNrLmNvbS9ibG9ncy9jb25zdHJ1Y3Rpb24vc3VwcG9ydGluZy13b21lbi1jb25zdHJ1Y3Rpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC8570760>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9kZXNrLmNvbS9ibG9ncy9jb25zdHJ1Y3Rpb24vc3VwcG9ydGluZy13b21lbi1jb25zdHJ1Y3Rpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

In addition it eliminates the extreme workload pressure in the healthcare ecosystem especially in pharmacy stores.

Automation in pharmacy means peace of mind to patients staff members and stakeholders.

The real meaning of automation in pharmacy

People think that automation is all about robots taking charge.

But in reality it’s more than just a robot.

Automation in pharmacy is an advanced system or software solution that automates repetitive tasks to eliminate manual errors streamline workflows speed up the process ensure operational efficiency and save time costs and resources.

Repetitive tasks include

Manual data entry

Inventory management

Prescription refill

Patient data management

Billing and accounting

This means the ultimate goal of the pharmacy automation system is to make life easier for pharmacists using robust tech.

A rise of the new era. The lucrative market is the proof itself.

As per the exclusive report from the Globe News Wire “The Global Pharmacy Automation Market size is valued at USD 5083 Million in 2021 and is expected to reach USD 10402 Million by 2030.”

For pharmacies improving efficiency and accuracy has always been a significant headache.

When we look at the past the early forms of the automation system were expensive for pharmacies.

But the current scenario is entirely different. Pharmacies can now quickly implement advanced and robust automation software and machines at an affordable expense.

The adoption of automation is rising at a rapid pace in pharmacies or drug stores.

For instance automated data-entry and dispensing systems auto-refill storage and retrieval systems are standard automation solutions in pharmacies.

Automation has made a positive impact on the productivity performance and efficiency of the pharmacy.

The rising demand for lower medication or human errors will drive the entire pharmacy automation market.

How does automation perform in the pharmacy ecosystem? A technical context

The aim is to automate repetitive tasks. So let’s explore what cooks behind the doors.

1. Tech scenario

RPA (Robotic Process Automation) drives manual workflows in autopilot mode.

It helps in creating and managing software robots.

Software robots are advanced tech solutions that perform tasks just like humans.

For instance it understands manages and completes the data entry process faster and more efficiently.

2. Now RPA tools are in action

You can’t build or deploy software robots into the pharmacy system without RPA tools.

UiPath (uipath dotcom) is one of the top RPA platforms to build RPA tech to automate repetitive tasks.

After creating a program you can download it as a .exe file.

But remember there are two ways – attended and unattended programs.

Attended means a manual start is needed while unattended the program automatically starts as per the scheduled time.

3. Now it’s time to install

Install a .exe file into the computer. Now your computer-based repetitive task is in autopilot mode just like Tesla.

Pharmacy areas that are experiencing the positive outcomes of the automation

One can automate the following computer-based repetitive tasks in the pharmacy.

Auto-refill to reduce the hassle of patients’ calls and text messages

Automated inventory management to avoid the headache of the time-consuming and costly processes

Automatic billing and invoicing to eliminate tedious procedures and manual errors

Email and SMS automation to notify the patients about their refills and other things

Automated pharmacy management to keep everything under the same roof

Automated patient data tracking system

Remote dispensing system

Automation brings happiness in the true sense

Automation opens endless possibilities for patients pharmacy staff and stakeholders to eliminate their headaches with ease.

Efficient and streamlined workflows

It makes the pharmacy ecosystem faster and more flexible

Allows pharmacists to focus on other key areas

Humans make mistakes. Automation doesn’t

It improves the work productivity of the staff.

Reduces the patient data management hassle

Helps in avoiding the mess of the inventory management

Auto-refills prescriptions that save time and resources

Improves patient care experience and satisfaction

Eliminates the human errors that enhance the patient safety

Faster and efficient communication

Ensures operational efficiency

Improves the accuracy of the workflows

Technologies in the automation systems

1. RPA (Robotic Process Automation):

We both are familiar with how RPA is becoming a helping hand for the pharmacy. It reduces the work burden of the staff and gives them peace of mind in the true sense.

But there are still limitations of the RPA.

It cannot think for itself and performs the task based on the analysis. This means it performs input for the fixed output.

In addition to this it also requires well-structured data to perform tasks more efficiently.

2. OCR (Optical Character Recognition):

OCR has emerged as the revolutionary tech solution in almost every sector.

The advanced technology automatically extracts the data from the image PDF and written text and converts it into a readable and editable format.

Automating the prescription ordering process is one of the drug store’s most common use cases of OCR.

However it also needs a well-structured data formation to give an accurate output.

3. Artificial Intelligence:

With zero doubt AI is now an integral part of the entire healthcare ecosystem.

From improving patient care experience to reducing the burnout of the clinical staff AI in healthcare has shown positive results in almost every corner.

AI enables the pharmacies to make data-driven decisions and automate manual tasks such as personalized messages to patients etc.

What makes it exceptional from the rest is that AI holds the potential to think for itself for the given task or change in the output.

Lastly an AI-based OCR system also helps get the ideal outcome even from the unstructured data format.

The future of the pharmacy automation

The pharmacy market is experiencing a growing trend of automation adoption.

RPA AI OCR and ML are creating new opportunities in almost every inch of the pharmacy.

But still pharmacists are performing double-checking systems on the prescription as automation is still in development.

However the advancement of these technologies in pharmacy app development and software development has the potential to bring 100% accuracy in the next few years.

More importantly AI harnesses the true power of big data that allows pharmacists to analyze risk patterns.

Here are some of the future needs for automation in pharmacy.

Faster and more efficient medication dispensing

More effective and outcome-driven patient data management

Better management system for the inventory and resources

100% accuracy in the repetitive tasks

To sum it up

Automation is bringing flexibility scalability and affordability into the pharmacy sector.

It adds result-driven value to the everyday task of the pharmacy team by allowing them to keep an eye on the other vital aspects of the ecosystem.

As a result pharmacies can now achieve their business goals without compromising costs labor and time.

The aim is to bring magic into the life of the patients pharmacists and stakeholders and automation is doing wonders for the same.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2h0YXJnZXQuY29tL3NlYXJjaGJ1c2luZXNzYW5hbHl0aWNzL2ZlYXR1cmUvQWNjb3VudGluZy1naWFudC1ib29zdHMtZWZmaWNpZW5jeS13aXRoLUFsdGVyeXgtYXV0b21hdGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Accounting giant boosts efficiency with Alteryx automation,"In the nearly two years since it first began using automation capabilities from Alteryx BDO USA has gained efficiencies that have led to cost savings and developed applications that it now sells to third parties.

Binder Dijker Otte is an international accounting tax and consulting firm founded in 1964 and based in Belgium with a presence in countries such as Australia China and the United Kingdom. Its U.S. operation -- BDO USA -- is based in Chicago.

Alteryx meanwhile is a data and analytics vendor founded in 1997 and based in Irvine Calif. whose platform is designed to automate much of the data preparation process.

The vendor rebranded its suite of tools in 2020 to reflect its focus on automation and it is now called the Alteryx Analytics Automation Platform. Alteryx formed a partnership with robotic process automation vendor UiPath in 2021 to further its automation capabilities.

Simultaneously Alteryx has been transitioning its platform to the cloud releasing its first cloud-native capabilities in February 2022 and remaking its C-suite to include leaders with cloud experience.

A new direction Two years ago BDO USA wanted to build customized applications for its tax data to both use internally with its own clients and sell to external organizations. At the time the company's different departments were using different data management and analytics platforms for preparing and analyzing data and developing analytics applications but hadn't standardized operations on one platform according to Dan Fuller managing partner of tax automation and innovation at BDO USA. And few of its operations were automated meaning that the company had to do repetitive time-consuming data preparation tasks manually. In 2019 BDO USA acquired TAXPE a firm whose tools automate aspects of the income tax reporting process for large firms. That acquisition served as an impetus for BDO USA sparking interest in automating more processes and beginning its search for a platform that could enable more automation. Industrywide the number of CPAs is declining meaning that the talent needed for an organization like BDO USA to continue growing is becoming harder to find. And that decline in the talent pipeline also contributed to the firm's interest in process automation -- particularly with low-code tools -- potentially completing more work with fewer people. ""During that time we evaluated what we wanted to do strategically. And as we were looking out there and talking to [vendors] we could see that low-code/no-code is where the future was going"" Fuller said. Fuller and his team narrowed their choice down to Alteryx and the Microsoft Power Platform which includes Microsoft Power Automate to enable process automation. Ultimately the low-code/no-code focus of the Alteryx APA led BDO USA -- which wanted a tool that was easy to use and easy to be trained on -- to choose the vendor. The firm began a pilot program with Alteryx in 2020 and fully deployed the data and analytics vendor's tools in September 2022 with expanded use of Alteryx Designer Server and Intelligence Suite. ""What we were trying to home in on was our technology strategy and from a low-code standpoint Alteryx is [platform] that you can pick up very quickly"" Fuller said. ""And from an efficiency standpoint it allows us to understand the value stream in a clear and concise way. What we're trying to do is cut out the routine tasks that lead to high turnover."" One example of a routine task BDO USA targeted for automation in hopes of increasing efficiency and reducing staff turnover was filing K-1 tax forms to report an organization's finances which involves uploading of data data entry and a slew of calculations. A screenshot displays a workflow combining Alteryx's Analytic Process Automation platform with robotic process automation capabilities.

Results In the nearly two years since BDO USA first began using Alteryx on a trial basis the firm has accomplished what it hoped for when it first chose the data and analytics vendor's tools over the Microsoft Power Platform according to Fuller. By automating what were previously manual tasks the firm has saved about 100000 work hours Fuller said. Alteryx has essentially taken over BDO USA's data management letting the firm transition its focus away from mundane accounting tasks and make technology that leads to efficiency and a new focus. ""We're no longer a tax firm that uses technology -- now we're a technology firm that does taxes"" Fuller said. ""That's a real statement about what we're looking to do. We have to operate in a [technologically advanced] environment and we have to think in technological terms."" Those technological terms include a strong development operations program and a focus on enabling agile decision-making. ""Understanding data is critical and we have so much data as an accounting firm"" Fuller said. ""We want to harness the power of that data to create efficiencies."" In addition to increasing efficiency BDO USA has used Alteryx to build applications it is now selling to third parties. The firm has a partnership with Thomson Reuters which – despite being a media conglomerate -- also builds tax and accounting software. The companies have worked together to build tax automation products with the Alteryx platform that they're now selling to third parties resulting in about $2 million in extra revenue according to Fuller. ""We've used [Alteryx] in that space and continue to grow that space now that we have the knowledge base"" Fuller said. We're no longer a tax firm that uses technology -- now we're a technology firm that does taxes. That's a real statement about what we're looking to do. We have to operate in a [technologically advanced] environment and we have to think in technological terms. Dan FullerManaging partner of tax automation and innovation BDO USA Meanwhile use of Alteryx is growing quickly throughout BDO USA. Despite only deploying the platform on a pilot basis until September Fuller estimated that about 15% of BDO USA's employees are already using Alteryx. The low-code/no-code structure of the platform makes it easy to learn as has Alteryx's willingness to work with BDO to train the firm's employees on use of the platform's automation capabilities by setting up an Alteryx university to educate its userbase according to Fuller. ""Their willingness to educate us was one of the big wins for us and one of the things that attracted us to work with Alteryx"" he said. Eventually within the next 18 to 24 months Fuller hopes that about 50% of BDO USA's employees will be using Alteryx as part of their normal workflows. The firm is just beginning to train what will become a group of ""Alteryx champions."" Those employees will then become analytics and automation leaders within their departments and train others. ""With the success of [training] our goal is to ramp up extremely fast"" Fuller said."

The firm’s thesis is to invest in technologies and businesses that have the potential to transform large enterprises across both software and hardware.

People often underestimate the power of places outside Silicon Valley in venture capital. The advantage of Ridgeline is their relationships with their strategic corporate limited partners (LPs) —including Fortune 500 companies FedEx AutoZone and Dollar General all headquartered in Tennessee—representing foundational industries that impact the lives of many Americans every day. These strategic corporate LPs through investing with Ridgeline intend to drive innovation in their organizations by conducting meaningful pilots and proofs of concept with the firm’s portfolio.

“Ridgeline's thesis is shaped by the digital transformation they have witnessed over successful careers in the military and in the corporate world” said Frederick W. Smith Founder and Executive Chairman of FedEx Corporation and Bill Rhodes Chairman President and CEO of AutoZone in a jointly written letter. “They understand a business's need to analyze data at scale incorporate machine learning into data flows and integrate autonomy and robotics into operations. This value chain provides a great early-stage investment opportunity as it creates the ability to solve complex and costly business problems in an accelerated way creating value for both customers and shareholders alike.”

“At Dollar General we are supportive of new and innovative ways to meet the needs of our customers and better serve our local communities” said Todd Vasos Dollar General’s CEO. “We look forward to combining the experience and technologies Ridgeline will bring with our unique store footprint and reach across the country in an effort to further enhance our operations supply chain and both the employee and customer experience.”

Additional LPs include Staley Cates' community foundation donor-advised fund; Kevin Ryan CEO AlleyCorp and co-founder of MongoDB; and Ray Rothrock CEO of FiftySix Investments and former General Partner at Venrock. Advisors include Kevin Compton Co-Founder and Partner at Radar Partners; and Michèle Flournoy Co-Founder and Managing Partner of WestExec Advisors.

Ridgeline’s portfolio highlights so far include:

Wallaroo—providing a simple secure and scalable deployment capability for last-mile machine learning. Ridgeline invested in Wallaroo in January 2020 helping the company grow its revenue across multiple government and commercial customers. The company raised a $25m Series A from M12 in January 2022.

PlanetWatchers—bringing the analysis of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to the commercial world with use cases in agriculture climate and insurance. Ridgeline invested in PlanetWatchers in June 2021 helping the company gain traction with government customers starting with the USDA. In August 2022 the company raised a $11m Series A led by Seraphim Space and Creative Ventures.

Ridgeline was established to identify partner with and serve founders as they prepare to go to market. The firm leverages its expertise and deep network to surround founders with the resources and relationships they need to navigate the fraught terrain between product potential and product market fit. Early-stage technology companies that receive investment from Ridgeline notably gain meaningful access to FedEx AutoZone and Dollar General.

All of Ridgeline’s founding partners come from a background of service and realized it was faster to solve problems in national security from the private sector. Ryan Clinton and Ben Walker are graduates of West Point and served together in combat operations overseas. Andrew McMahon is a former Obama Administration appointee. Prior to Ridgeline Clinton was a lead for growth and business development at Anduril and head of strategy and business development for the Brand Development group at Comcast NBCUniversal. Walker helped to build Deloitte’s Silicon Valley practice and was a co-founding Partner at Harpoon Ventures. After his government service McMahon was Chief Revenue Officer of The Dcode Group a business development consulting firm serving growth stage start-ups.

Ridgeline plans to invest in early-stage enterprise software and hardware companies at the seed and Series A stages. The firm has made 17 investments in Fund I to date and expects to invest in up to 30 companies throughout the life of the fund.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnZlc3RvcnMuY29tL25ld3MvbWFuYWdlbWVudC9sZWFkZXJzLWFuZC1zdWNjZXNzL21hcnktYW5kZXJzb24td2hvLWludmVudGVkLXRoZS13aW5kc2hpZWxkLXdpcGVyLWhpbnQtaXQtd2FzbnQtYS1tYW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mary Anderson: How She Invented Windshield Wipers Despite The Odds,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/mary-anderson-who-invented-the-windshield-wiper-hint-it-wasnt-a-man/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnZlc3RvcnMuY29tL25ld3MvbWFuYWdlbWVudC9sZWFkZXJzLWFuZC1zdWNjZXNzL21hcnktYW5kZXJzb24td2hvLWludmVudGVkLXRoZS13aW5kc2hpZWxkLXdpcGVyLWhpbnQtaXQtd2FzbnQtYS1tYW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8wNC93aHktYS1tZW1waGlzLXZjLWlzLWJldHRpbmctNTJtLW9uLXN0YXJ0dXBzLXNlbGxpbmctdG8tY29tcGxleC1vcmdzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why a Memphis VC is betting $52M on startups selling to complex orgs,"Ridgeline is a new VC firm that invests in B2B companies with a specific goal in mind: helping its portfolio companies sell to complex organizations that are hard to crack but can be great customers if you break into them.

The Memphis Tennessee-based firm was started in 2020 by Ben Walker Ryan Clinton and Andrew McMahon — three individuals who each know a thing or two about complicated entities that need better tech solutions from their time working in government orgs. Walker and Clinton met at West Point before being deployed to Iraq together while McMahon’s background includes time spent with the General Services Administration.

Ridgeline isn’t just focused on companies that could sell to the government — which has become a popular strategy lately — but does think their experience navigating that process could prove to be useful for some of their portfolio. Instead it’s looking to back companies that could help any complex legacy entity from the feds to FedEx.

“The corporate world has the same technology problem that the federal government does” Walker told TechCrunch. “We are trying to drive our portfolio into complex organizations really regardless of whether they are in the federal space or the commercial space. I think that dual focus is something that is unique about Ridgeline.”

Ridgeline raised an oversubscribed debut fund of $52 million to back enterprise tech companies at the seed and Series A stages. The firm aims to take 5% to 10% ownership in its companies and plans to write checks of up to $5 million McMahon said. The firm is about halfway through deploying its capital and looks to invest in up to 10 more companies.

Despite being oversubscribed the fund was impacted by the market uncertainty earlier this year and had a few investors pull out at the end Walker said. But the LPs the firm ended up with including large consumer conglomerates like FedEx Dollar General and AutoZone prompted the firm to move to Memphis.

“The opportunity to partner with them is to bolster their innovation efforts in a lot of ways” Clinton said. “We took it one step further to establish a headquarters here to take full advantage of these relationships and drive value for our portfolio companies.”

Walker added that the fact that many of the firm’s LPs are based in middle America means they are largely overlooked by both coastal VCs and companies as potential customers for new technology despite having many of the same problems other legacy corporations have.

“[Working near these companies] ends up being a massive differentiator to source and win deals” Walker said. “It was one of the main reasons we moved to Memphis. You can’t fake that. You can’t have that as a narrative and not be in Memphis and make that happen. It’s still difficult to get an enterprise deal done anywhere.”

Ridgeline is targeting companies in sectors like manufacturing supply chain logistics retail tech and data analytics among others. The firm has made 18 investments thus far which include geospatial intelligence company PlanetWatchers and machine learning startup Neural Magic.

And while Ridgeline hopes to help some of its portfolio companies land contracts with the federal government McMahon said they aren’t looking to push their companies in that direction. It is a lengthy process that isn’t for all startups and timing of when to pitch is key.

“It’s always a responsible approach to that market” he said. “It’s so big it can have its own gravitational pull. They can very quickly become largely defense from a revenue standpoint. We would much rather have companies have a large commercial and enterprise revenue stream and a similar proportion of that be revenue from the government.”

While it hopes it can help its startups succeed the firm founders also hope their efforts have a ripple effect on the companies and the people of the city of Memphis.

“It allows us to look for companies sprouting out of the South and this industrial belt that is often overlooked in VC” Walker said. “It’s going to allow us to see things before they pop up in the general radar. It’s something we feel like Memphis has provided and it’s allowed our portfolio to punch above its weight.”",,,,,,

Through this partnership businesses that use SAP technologies can access item-level insights from atma.io for their products from manufacturing to distribution to shelf. Transparency provides unique supply chain information enabling expiry date management and automation.

Driving these efficiencies is item-level data delivered to the SAP Analytics Cloud dashboard via atma.io and products tagged with unique digital Identification (ID) technology by Avery Dennison including radio frequency identification (RFID). It means retailers can experience accurate and timely analysis enabling them to automate food expiration management at the store. It also means that grocers can go deeper into their supply chain and implement ‘dwell time’ measurements to boost the speed with which items move through warehouses and distribution centers to arrive in stores with longer shelf lives.

The new partnership will benefit omnichannel retail and help retailers with Click & Collect (or BOPIS i.e. Buy Online Pickup In-Store) and home delivery where sending and delivering products with the right expiration date has been a challenge.

It can also help in certain ‘emergency’ situations such as when a product recall needs to be initiated quickly. During the FDA’s recent New Era of Smarter Food Safety Summit on E-Commerce it was emphasized that omnichannel food would need to meet the same high standards of food purchased in person. On November 7 2022 the FSMA 204 rule for Food Traceability will be published with an expected compliance date by 2025. Compliance requires all supply chain members to respond electronically within 24 hours with the product ID relevant date and a lot code for products covered by the legislation.

Max Winograd vice president of connected products at Avery Dennison Smartrac said: ‘Accurate real-time supply chain management is more important than ever and we’re pleased to partner with SAP to help businesses manage their supply chain operations. Food waste is a global problem impacting people the planet and profits and we’re greatly encouraged by the remarkable results digital ID technology and atma.io has already achieved with some of our existing retail customers and look forward to working with SAP so that more can reap these benefits.’

Mike Wells RVP SAP BTP monetization partner ecosystem success at SAP added: ‘This partnership provides businesses using SAP Analytics Cloud with a turnkey integration for expiry date automation and management. Introducing item-level tracking via RFID and atma.io into our ecosystem will help provide customers with increased simplicity speed efficiency accuracy security and reporting capabilities. We look forward to working with Avery Dennison to eliminate the huge issue of food waste.’",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMubWFzc2xpdmUuY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvbWFzc2xpdmUvbmFtZS9tYXJnYXJldC1idXJrZS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNjcwNTU3MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Margaret Burke Obituary (2022) - Holyoke MA - The Republican,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://obits.masslive.com/us/obituaries/masslive/name/margaret-burke-obituary?id=36705572 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMubWFzc2xpdmUuY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvbWFzc2xpdmUvbmFtZS9tYXJnYXJldC1idXJrZS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNjcwNTU3MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjQ5ZXJzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RoaXMtZGF5LWluLXRoZS1iYXktbWNlbGhlbm55LXNldHMtdGVhbS1yZWNvcmQtYXMtYS1yb29raWXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Day in The Bay: McElhenny Sets Team Record as a Rookie,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvdGhlc2UtZGF5cy1zYXRpbi1ibGFjay1pcy10aGUtbmFtZS1vZi10aGUtbXVyZGVyZWQtb3V0LWNhZGlsbGFjLWVzY2FsYWRlLWdhbWUtMjAwMzQwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These Days Satin Black Is the Name of the Murdered-Out Cadillac Escalade Game,"Not long ago the Cadillac Escalade luxury full-size SUV had little to no competition when it came to outrageous aftermarket builds. Now one needs to think outside the box to stand out in a custom crowd.

SUV

From the off-road-passionate Mercedes-Benz G-Class to the ritzy yet still capable Range Rover there is never a shortage of mall crawlers. Alas someone from America who values tradition above all else will only have eyes for GM’s Cadillac Escalade . And do not even dare to think that the novelty of the fifth-generationhas already worn out.Not when it comes to aftermarket transformations at least. And no worries there is no need to take our word for granted. Instead we have a trio of examples. An initial good case in point could be made by the good folks over at Miami Florida-based MetroWrapz  whose experts are some of the craziest car vinyl wrap artists out there even when it comes to portraying a client’s tame vision.Such was the case recently with a dark gray Caddy Escalade that got a nice finishing touch by way of a 3M Films Gloss Black chrome delete complete with a grille wrap and an abundance of accenting all around. But this subtle makeover was soon eclipsed by a second luxury SUV that showed the new murdered-out style isn’t orange but rather Satin Black.And of course they did that with help from some Avery Dennison Graphics vinyl with the Satin Black color change doubled with the usual chrome delete plus accenting on the door and trunk jambs among others. By the way just in case you were wondering how all that works there is also a cool behind-the-scenes making-of video embedded below. But what happens if you’re into Gloss Black murdered-out?Well courtesy of Sacramento California-based vehicle specialist Diamond Autosport and Forgiato Designs  there is always a solution for that as well. The latest one comes in the form of this menacing Caddy Escalade riding posh on humongous aftermarket wheels.

Scott's vision was ""to unite the City with this unique event while supporting local economic and cultural development of our City"" he said in a statement. ""While LITFest is now canceled for this weekend it is my desire to see it move forward in the future.""

Although Scott had promoted the idea of a new festival as early as March 2021 LITFest fell apart just days before it was supposed to debut.

The city made the decision earlier this year to partner with a public-affairs firm called Think Rubix in order to produce the festival.

The firm announced it had hired Scott's former chief of staff Charles Blake a week before Little Rock revealed the firm had been selected for LITFest.

On Monday Little Rock City Manager Bruce Moore informed Think Rubix that he was terminating the agreement for unspecified contract violations.

""As of October 3 2022 no City funds have been deposited by Think Rubix and a stop payment procedure has been initiated by the City of Little Rock for the check issued by the City in the amount of $30000"" Moore wrote in a letter addressed to Think Rubix Managing Principal Tristan Wilkerson. ""No further payments will be forthcoming.""

Under the agreement Think Rubix was set to receive up to $45000 from the city.

Because the contract was the subject of a competitive bid and the amount fell below $50000 the agreement only needed Moore's approval and never went before the Little Rock Board of Directors. Moore signed the contract June 9.

Ahead of the festival's cancellation new documents shed light on Blake's involvement with Think Rubix's bid. They also revealed prior discussions among officials about LITFest's financial architecture.

A cache of records obtained by local attorney Matthew Campbell author of the ""Blue Hog Report"" blog showed Blake participated in conversations at Think Rubix regarding the firm's bid contradicting Little Rock's initial assertion that the former chief of staff was not involved.

And the records indicated officials such as Kendra Pruitt Scott's current chief of staff had discussed routing additional dollars from sponsors to a nonprofit group tied to Think Rubix with the idea that the nonprofit -- called the Foundation for Social Impact -- would keep a percentage of the proceeds.

In a letter to city officials Friday Little Rock City Attorney Tom Carpenter referred to a videoconference meeting in which Pruitt expressed a desire to avoid the city board's review by using sponsorship money to fund LITFest. ""The video creates serious legal concerns about this contract"" Carpenter wrote.

The city manager canceled the agreement three days later.

City officials did not respond to specific questions Tuesday regarding money collected by the Foundation for Social Impact and Think Rubix whether Little Rock would attempt to claw back money and if they believe Little Rock or any employees could face legal exposure as a result of LITFest's financial arrangements.

""Throughout this process both Think Rubix and the City have acted legally and within the normal bounds of contracting and procurement"" Scott said in his statement. ""Think Rubix is a reputable company with a strong background in event planning and management and despite heavy scrutiny it had been implementing plans for LITFest on behalf of the City since the contract took effect June 9.""

The LITFest contract prepared by the city attorney's office ""was not optimized for the scale and scope of this music festival"" Scott said. ""I'm disappointed that divisive politics negatively affected the vision and impact of this inaugural festival.""

Shortly before Scott announced the festival's cancellation Wilkerson deferred to the city in a statement issued on behalf of the public-affairs firm. ""Think Rubix does not have the authority to cancel or postpone LITFest"" he said.

The firm had received no compensation from Little Rock under the contract Wilkerson said.

""Per industry standards and as requested by the City of Little Rock a fiscal sponsor was secured. Think Rubix has not received any compensation from sponsorship funds and the fiscal sponsor did not retain any fees"" he said. ""We requested instructions from the city on where and to whom to direct the remaining sponsorship funds. A final accounting and project report is being prepared for the city following the terms of the agreement.""

At one point Think Rubix officials advised the city to have LITFest occur at a later date Wilkerson noted.

In a phone interview Tuesday Wilkerson declined to provide additional comments on the record with regard to Moore's termination of the contract and the amount of sponsorship funding that was collected.

However Wilkerson confirmed the ""fiscal sponsor"" mentioned in his statement was the Foundation for Social Impact.

As of last week the singer Ashanti was set to perform at the Robinson Center on Saturday as the LITFest headliner. Other events under the LITFest umbrella included a River Market block party and a gathering of performers and vendors on 9th Street.

After the mayor's announcement Tuesday Libby Lloyd a spokeswoman for the Little Rock Convention and Visitors Bureau which manages the Robinson Center said officials had not received any word about Ashanti's performance.

Two concerts that were scheduled for The Hall prior to LITFest and were later looped into the festival are still set to take place according to Jeremy Hicks communications director for the venue.

Lucero will perform Thursday followed by BoomBox on Friday.Panel discussions that were scheduled for The Hall on Saturday will not occur Hicks said.

LITFest's presenting sponsor was Axon Enterprise a company that produces the Taser as well as police body cameras and software.

In response to a request for comment via email Tuesday Axon's press office said ""Given that the event has been canceled Axon has withdrawn our sponsorship.""

In his letter to city officials late last week Carpenter noted that a video in which officials discuss LITFest ""has also been provided to the prosecuting attorney's office as part of its continuing investigation of how the City handles AFOIA [Arkansas Freedom of Information Act] issues.""

When asked about Carpenter's comment and LITFest in an email Tuesday Prosecuting Attorney Larry Jegley of the 6th Judicial District wrote in an email ""We are currently evaluating several matters of concern regarding FOI and other things with the City of Little Rock.""

On a drizzly stretch of B.C. coastline at the head of the Douglas Channel Canada’s first natural gas export terminal is taking shape.

The sprawling site on the traditional territory of the Haisla Nation teems with more than 5000 construction and trades workers working around the clock to bring the $40-billion Shell Plc.-led LNG Canada terminal to completion.

The latest piece of the puzzle: a colossal 3000-ton Baker Hughes compressor that arrived in Kitimat by boat from Italy on Sep. 20 the first of four that will form the powerful jet engine of the terminal’s liquefaction process. Its arrival puts the project — and the country — one important step closer to seeing the first cargo of liquefied natural gas depart from its shores.

Already more than 70 per cent complete LNG Canada could be operational by the middle of the decade and promises to unlock the full economic potential of Canada’s rich gas reserves for the first time.

It’s a change that will take some adjusting to in the oilpatch. Despite being the fifth-largest supplier of natural gas in the world Canada’s energy sector has long seen its production hemmed in by pipeline constraints and market conditions in the United States.

An export terminal on the West Coast providing access to global markets would be a game-changer for Canadian producers who have been maxing out the volumes they can push into the U.S. Midwest and Eastern Canada said Richard Frey an analyst with S&P Global Commodity Insights. In 2021 Canada exported an average of 7.6 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of natural gas to the U.S. and imported 2.2 Bcf/d.

“There’s really not a whole lot of room to do anything more beyond what they’re sending right now” Frey said. “So this will be an additional outlet and a large outlet at that too. If North American prices remain high … it could easily grow production by two (billion cubic feet of natural gas) per day.”

Hundreds of kilometres inland veteran oilpatch leaders in landlocked Alberta have watched as more than a dozen West Coast LNG ventures were shelved or cancelled over the years as regulatory delays or market conditions battered proposals and soured investors — all while nascent LNG export industries took off in Australia and the U.S.

Story continues

Now those same oilpatch veterans are urging Shell and its partners to quickly green-light a second phase of the project effectively doubling the export capacity of the plant from 14 million tonnes of LNG per year in the first phase to 28 million tonnes a year.

A view of the LNG Canada site.

“We had an opportunity that required us getting after these projects 10 to 15 years ago. We didn’t for all kinds of reasons” said Tourmaline Oil Corp. chief executive and founder Mike Rose. “Fortunately we have a second crack at it. So I’d like to see more than just LNG Canada phase one — we’d like to see both phases of LNG Canada and more projects on the West Coast.”

Experts in the sector say Canada’s advantages as a West Coast LNG exporter are considerable. They include the significant low-cost supply from western gas fields such as the giant Montney formation that straddles the border between Northern B.C. and Alberta shorter shipping distances to Asian markets access to renewable hydroelectricity and a colder climate than U.S. Gulf Coast competitors who must expend more energy to cool gas through the liquefaction process. In combination these factors mean LNG Canada’s facility in Kitimat will have one of the lowest carbon intensities of any LNG project in the world.

The $40-billion facility is furthest along of a small pack of proposed West Coast projects that have benefited from the fresh interest in Canadian LNG brought on by the global energy crunch following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

In Kitimat work can’t progress fast enough for LNG Canada’s investors even as massive new pieces of equipment and machinery arrive almost weekly. A 56-meter-high circular tank — the second-largest LNG tank in the world — is also nearing completion and will eventually store the super-chilled natural gas until tankers arrive to carry it away.

The LNG Canada terminal under construction in Kitimat B.C. on Sept. 28 2022.

But despite the current enthusiasm for Canada’s LNG potential there are disadvantages to being a late entrant in a crowded global LNG market.

The long-term nature of investments in LNG present a risk if global demand for natural gas declines faster than expected. One of Shell’s own recently published climate models suggests that it is conceivable that global gas demand could peak in the 2030s as governments around the world switch to low-carbon energy sources — a timeline that has been vociferously contested on both sides of the climate debate.

“It doesn’t really make sense to build a facility if you don’t think you’re going to get a lot of good use out of it for at least a decade if not two decades” Frey said. “There’s a lot of questions right now about natural gas’s role in the future energy mix. So that’s what I would be the most concerned about: It looks great right now but what does it look like in 2045?”

Among the factors helping to bolster local enthusiasm for Canada’s prospects as an LNG exporter is the energy sector’s growing relationship with Indigenous communities.

It looks great right now but what does it look like in 2045?

Richard Frey

In a reversal from the industry’s old pattern in dealings with Indigenous peoples in Western Canada the focus now is on consultations and carefully negotiated benefit agreements with communities affected by the energy sector’s activities.

In the case of LNG Canada built on Haisla Nation territory the project has brought revenue employment opportunities and more than 20 joint-venture partnerships with related businesses. Haisla Chief Councillor Crystal Smith said she has urged members of her nation to take advantage of training and career opportunities to propel their careers long after construction on the LNG Canada mega-project begins to taper off.

“That is the reason we wanted and supported this project” Smith said. “I’m not saying that everything has been perfect” Smith added pointing to the area’s housing shortage and the difficulty in attracting and retaining teachers and an addictions counsellor.

“But for the most part what we’re experiencing now is what we wanted for our people in our community and our region.”

Even better Smith said is the promise of the proposed $3-billion Cedar LNG project which would neighbour LNG Canada in Kitimat and be majority-owned by Indigenous groups. The project is currently awaiting a decision under B.C.’s environmental assessment process.

“I often describe our journey as one that started with not having a share or a say in any opportunity that occurred in our territory to being active at-the-table decision makers helping LNG Canada become successful. Now we are ‘the’ decision makers in Cedar LNG and that in itself is a huge legacy” Smith said.

It’s unclear how many LNG projects will ultimately be approved by Canadian regulators.

LNG Canada chief executive Jason Klein.

Project proponents and investors will be watching closely as the governments of Canada and B.C. prepare to roll out more detailed plans to cut emissions from the oil and gas industry. Some oilpatch leaders and Indigenous groups with ambitions to invest in energy projects have warned that the introduction of a sector-specific emissions cap could thwart further investments in LNG.

Still LNG Canada CEO Jason Klein said he remains optimistic about the economics of Shell’s project and the sector’s potential to endure as the global energy transition unfolds.

Pointing to the company’s 40-year permit to operate in Kitimat Klein said he believes there is starting to be an acknowledgement that not all LNG projects are created equal.

“The cleanest molecule is going to be the last molecule standing” Klein said. “That’s one of the reasons why I feel so good about LNG Canada because we are that clean molecule. And when people start getting really picky whether driven by carbon price or otherwise the cleanest LNG will be the last LNG — which right now in the world that’s right here.”

A billion dollars sure is a lot of money. How 24 of the deepest pockets in town are shaping the city—and our lives.

Get a compelling long read and must-have lifestyle tips in your inbox every Sunday morning — great with coffee!

Stunning wealth is nothing new to Boston. In fact it’s been part of the city’s fabric for centuries. The Cabots and the Lowells preceded Fidelity’s Johnson clan and the Patriots-owning Kraft dynasty has nothing on surnames such as Saltonstall Forbes Gardner Wigglesworth Amory and Perkins. What is new is the growth of individual riches in this city and how the folks who have money got it.

Today’s local billionaires in fact are the farthest thing from your Brahmin ancestor’s merchant magnates. Most didn’t have the benefit of family wealth. Several are immigrants or first-generation Americans. And the number of members in the city’s most exclusive club has only increased over the past few years in lockstep with global trends: The world’s population of three-comma-net-worth individuals expanded during the pandemic with the U.S. alone closing in on 1000 of them according to Wealth-X an Altrata company which maintains a proprietary collection of research on the well-to-do. To come up with the roster of 24 names you’ll find on this list we partnered with Wealth-X to identify those they consider billionaires and we consider Bostonians.

Twenty-four billionaires in a city of nearly 700000 might not seem like that many. But the ever-increasing concentration of money—roughly $85 billion at press time—among the Hub’s wealthiest is a striking trend particularly as the skyrocketing cost of living shines a spotlight on our ever-widening wealth gap. Consider that Boston ranks among the top 10 cities for income inequality in the nation with our highest-earning households earning a whopping 15 times more than the lowest-earning households in 2016.

At least the city isn’t yet home to any “super billionaires”: the 20 individuals who have a net worth of at least $50 billion and collectively hold a stunning 17 percent of all billionaire wealth. In fact Fidelity CEO Abigail Johnson with some $20 billion and Patriots CEO Robert Kraft with $10.6 billion are the only Bostonians to top $10 billion or to even come close to that 11th digit.

Just a word about wealth estimates: They fluctuate. Wealth-X did not provide them and it’s worth using caution when considering figures from Forbes Bloomberg and others. That’s because the recent wild fluctuations of the stock market real estate and even cryptocurrency quickly render any dollar figure placed on assets obsolete. Moderna’s Stéphane Bancel for instance was reported last autumn to be worth more than $12 billion; this spring the figure cited was $4 billion. Jim Koch the founder of Boston Beer Company debuted on the Forbes 400 list in 2020 thanks to the soaring value of shares in his company. The value of those shares has since plummeted and Wealth-X does not consider him a billionaire.

Regardless of individual net worth the one thing this group of deep-pocketed Bostonians does have in common with the Brahmins of yore is their commitment to carrying on the community-oriented examples of the barons who gave us the MFA Mass General and WGBH. Today’s billionaires are not only supporting many of those same institutions but are also transforming the region with new buildings and developments making medical breakthroughs and backing more contemporary efforts to promote equity and racial justice.

In other words they affect the quality of our lives in ways big and small every day. We’ve relied on them to put together a good Pats team create a new neighborhood and rail station in Brighton and preserve our hometown newspaper and baseball team. And that certainly makes it worth knowing a little about them.

Abigail Johnson

Chairman and CEO Fidelity

Age: 60

Lives In: Milton

How She Made It: It’s the classic story of a multigenerational family business: Grandpa started the company Dad grew it into a big success and Abby spent years learning and working her way up through its ranks. It so happens that the family business is one of the world’s largest financial service firms and Abby owns a quarter of the stock.

How She’s an Ordinary Person: By all accounts Johnson just likes to stay home with her husband healthcare entrepreneur Christopher McKown.

How She’s Not an Ordinary Person: She lost an estimated $10 billion of personal wealth over the course of four months this past winter according to Bloomberg. She’s already recovered most of that and that publication believes Johnson is currently worth roughly

$20 billion.

She Uses Her Money for Good When She: Supports arts education and youth development. The Johnson family has a reputation for very generous philanthropy which Abby is said to continue. She is of course a director of the mammoth Fidelity Foundation which has well over a billion dollars in assets and hands out some $50 million a year in grants.

Signature Look: Those iconic heavy-rimmed glasses although she has said that she goes unrecognized on the sidewalks of Boston.

Fun Things She Owns: A five-bedroom 5500-square-foot seaside cottage on Nantucket’s Brant Point bought for $9 million and currently assessed at more than $16 million.

Her Politics: Johnson has made campaign contributions to candidates on both sides of the aisle often to moderates. Not usually a major giver (for her wealth bracket) she did open her wallet to give $220000 to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 election campaign after her preferred candidate Jeb Bush dropped out.

Why She Flies Under the Radar: Johnson maintains—and even exceeds—her father and grandfather’s tradition of excessive privacy especially regarding the news media. (Although she has started to grant some industry interviews over the past couple of years.)

Robert Kraft

Chairman and CEO Kraft Group

Age: 81

Lives In: Brookline

How He Made It: First he married well. Then after expanding his in-laws’ packaging business he parlayed that into ownership of a football stadium which he used as leverage to eventually buy the team playing there. He then turned the New England Patriots into one of the world’s most valuable sports franchises: Forbes estimates the team is worth $5 billion of Kraft’s overall $10.6 billion net worth.

How He’s an Ordinary Person: Just watch him in the owner’s box—he goes through every emotion you do during a Pats game.

How He’s Not an Ordinary Person: Kraft gets his pal Elton John to play at his private parties—and attends John’s parties in Hollywood.

Superstar Moment: Early in the COVID crisis with personal protective equipment in short supply Kraft used the Patriots team plane to fly in 1.2 million N95 masks from China.

He Uses His Money for Good When He: Supports community health—and a host of other causes and institutions—through the Kraft Family Foundation.

Signature Look: Blue jacket red tie sneakers.

Fun Things He Owns: The New England Revolution and six Lombardi trophies.

His Politics: His close connection with Donald Trump has been the headlining story but Kraft actually tends to give more of his money to Democrats than Republicans.

Jim Davis

Owner and chairman New Balance

Age: 79

Lives In: Newton

How He Made It: Manufacturing shoes and athletic apparel. He was still in his twenties when he purchased the 66-year-old New Balance shoe company for $100000 on the day of the Boston Marathon in 1972. Just in time for the running craze of the mid-1970s Davis introduced new styles and increased capacity and the rest as they say is history. Although he stepped down as CEO in 2007 he has kept the company private and he and his wife Anne remain chairman and vice chair.

How He’s an Ordinary Person: He couldn’t cut it as a pre-med student. Davis studied biology at Middlebury College until he was told that perhaps his talents lay elsewhere.

How He’s Not an Ordinary Person: Davis who Forbes estimates is a four-times-over billionaire has been dubbed “The richest Greek on the planet.”

His Fingerprints on the City: Davis almost single-handedly created a new Boston neighborhood Boston Landing around the headquarters he opened there in 2015. It has the Celtics’ training facility an ice rink a concert hall a commuter-rail station office and lab space and very little of the desolate landscape many of us remember.

Fun Things He Owns: A growing real estate empire in Gloucester including his $3 million Bay View summer home and the $25 million Beauport Hotel.

His Politics: Davis is a GOP bankroller having supported both Mitt Romney and Donald Trump. In last year’s nonpartisan Boston mayoral election he spent more than a million dollars trying to get Annissa Essaibi George elected.

John Henry

Founder and principal owner Fenway Sports Group

Age: 73

Lives In: Brookline

How He Made It: Commodities trading then hedge fund management and now sports ownership has allowed Henry to amass what Forbes says is a $4 billion fortune.

How He’s an Ordinary Person: As a teenager Henry played guitar in a prog-rock band.

How He’s Not an Ordinary Person: Henry and his wife—Boston Globe CEO Linda Pizzuti Henry—host an elaborate themed summer solstice party at their Brookline home for the locally rich and fabulous every year.

Good Luck Charm: Did Henry break the Curse of the Bambino? One could certainly make the argument given that the Red Sox won the World Series just two years after he bought the team.

He Uses His Money for Good When He: Gives to healthcare and educational charities through his family foundation including BostonSight Boston Healthcare for the Homeless Program the Meadowbrook School in Weston and the Fessenden School in West Newton.

Signature Look: Everybody in Red Sox Nation knows Henry’s dark-rimmed rectangular glasses.

Fun Things He Owns: The Boston Globe and a Daytona 500–winning racing group. Also a fabulous 35000-square-foot home in Brookline—on the previous site of Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt’s much smaller place which Henry tore down after buying the property in 2007.

His Politics: He has mostly steered clear of politics with the exception of supporting the 2004 presidential candidacy of Red Sox devotee John Kerry.

Amos Hostetter Jr.

Chairman Pilot House Associates

Age: 85

Lives In: Beacon Hill

How He Made It: Hostetter established a company in 1963 with his college buddy Irv Grousbeck—now co-owner of the Boston Celtics with his son Wyc—on the belief that TV viewers wanted more options. Over time Continental Cablevision became the third-largest cable-television provider in the country eventually selling in 1996 for more than $5 billion. He is currently worth a little more than $3 billion according to Forbes.

How He’s an Ordinary Person: He’s constantly trying to protect his properties from New England’s unforgiving climate—although in his case that has meant spending millions trying to forestall the collapse of his Nantucket home on Sconset Bluff.

How He’s Not an Ordinary Person: Hostetter lives in the Beacon Hill house built in 1800 by then-U.S. Representative Harrison Gray Otis one of the wealthiest Bostonians of the time.

He Uses His Money for Good When He: Supports education arts and most recently climate initiatives through the Barr Foundation chaired by his wife Barbara and assessed to have a stunning $2 billion in assets.

His Politics: Hostetter and Barbara are longtime high-dollar Democratic donors contributing millions in the 2020 election cycle alone.

Ted Alfond

Former executive vice president Dexter Shoes

Age: 78

Lives In: Weston

How He Made It: Through the worst deal Warren Buffett ever made—according to Buffett himself. Ted’s father Harold Alfond built a successful shoe business in an old Maine wool mill. In 1993 when Ted was an executive with the company Harold sold it to an overeager Warren Buffett for 25000 shares of Berkshire Hathaway stock—worth $439 million then and around $10 billion in 2022. Alfond is worth an estimated $2.3 billion today according to Forbes.

How He’s an Ordinary Person: He enjoys spending his summers on a Maine lake.

How He’s Not an Ordinary Person: With his wife Barbara Alfond is considered one of the country’s premier art collectors. They maintain a major contemporary collection at their alma mater Rollins College in Winter Park Florida. Closer to home you can visit the Alford Auditorium at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.

He Uses His Money for Good When He: Promotes education healthcare and youth development mostly through the Harold Alfond Foundation.

Fun Things He Owns: The oldest house in Weston dating to the 17th century. Also a slice of the Boston Red Sox.

Why He Flies Under the Radar: The Dexter Shoes brand the origin of his fortune ceased production 20 years ago.

Frank Laukien

President Chairman and CEO Bruker

Age: 62

Lives In: The Back Bay

How He Made It: By growing his father’s scientific instruments company along with his three siblings. The company’s high-tech equipment does everything from magnetic field research to greenhouse gas measurement. Laukien’s share of Bruker is a major part of his wealth estimated at more than $2 billion.

How He’s an Ordinary Person: Laukien’s interest in anti-cancer research is especially meaningful as his pioneering physicist father Günther Laukien died of cancer in 1997.

How He’s Not an Ordinary Person: He once paid his own brother nearly $20 million for a million shares of his stock in Bruker.

Innovations: Laukien is cofounding a new endeavor the Galileo Project to hunt for extraterrestrial technologies traveling or floating through space.

He Uses His Money for Good When He: Leads major anti-cancer efforts including the American Association for Cancer Research’s Cancer Evolution Working Group.

His Politics: Not historically a huge political donor Laukien has contributed to Republican Governor Charlie Baker and the Massachusetts Republican Party in general.

Why He Flies Under the Radar: Born in Stuttgart Germany and educated at MIT and Harvard Laukien mostly keeps his head down working on cutting-edge scientific initiatives rather than running up impressive wine tabs at the city’s finest restaurants.

Robert Langer

Institute Professor Langer Lab MIT

Age: 73

Lives In: Newton

How He Made It: Over the course of an extraordinary career in scientific research. Having founded or invested in many companies including Moderna Langer has been called “the Edison of biomedical engineering.” He came to prefer startups because he found Big Pharma companies frustratingly slow in developing his ideas.

How He’s an Ordinary Person: He is fascinated by magic and does tricks for classes and presentations (see: the TikTok of him pulling a very very long series of colored papers from his mouth).

How He’s Not an Ordinary Person: In addition to an estimated net worth of nearly $2 billion he has more than 1400 patents issued or pending.

Innovations: Where to start? His research has led to advances in treating brain cancer reversing paralysis and much more.

Fun Things He Owns: A prestigious Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering for which Langer and his wife Laura got to hang out with the late royal and her family.

Why You May Not Have Heard of Him: He spends his time hunkered down at his beloved MIT with his students and his research.

Herb Chambers

Owner Herb Chambers Companies

Age: 80

Lives In: The Back Bay

How He Made It: Selling more than $2 billion worth of cars a year—which is coincidentally his estimated net worth according to Forbes.

How He’s an Ordinary Person: He grew up in a two-family house in Dorchester.

How He’s Not an Ordinary Person: Chambers builds cutting-edge luxury yachts (all named Excellence) which he then sells before starting on the next one.

He Uses His Money for Good When He: Supports well-known Boston-area nonprofits—including Mass Eye and Ear the Boston Foundation and Camp Harbor View—through his charitable foundation.

Signature Look: Tortoiseshell glasses and slicked-back hair at work or out and about with his longtime girlfriend Melissa Lees.

His Politics: Although Chambers has frequently supported local Democrats—including Ed Markey and Lori Trahan—he used to write his biggest checks to the national and Massachusetts Republican Party committees. That changed in 2020 when he funded Joe Biden and the Democratic National Committee.

Noubar Afeyan

Founder and CEO Flagship Pioneering

Age: 60

Lives In: Lexington

How He Made It: Born in Lebanon and educated in Canada Afeyan has helped found dozens of life sciences companies since getting his Ph.D. from MIT in 1987 for biochemical engineering. One of them is Moderna which struck gold with a COVID-19 vaccine in 2020 pushing his net worth to an estimated $2 billion according to Forbes.

How He’s an Ordinary Person: Afeyan is a die-hard Boston Celtics fan.

How He’s Not an Ordinary Person: George Clooney is on the selection committee for an award program Afeyan cofounded the Aurora Prize for Awakening Humanity.

He Uses His Money for Good When He: Works to support Armenia from which his family hails. That includes donating a large sum toward a building for the St. Stephen’s Armenian Elementary School in Watertown and co-founding the Foundation for Armenian Science and Technology.

Signature Look: He’s seldom seen without a dark blazer; rarely however with a tie.

His Politics: Not a big political donor Afeyan has given almost exclusively to Democrats.

John Fish

Chairman and CEO Suffolk Construction Co.

Age: 62

Lives In: The Back Bay

How He Made It: Fish joined his father’s construction business after college and built it into a multibillion-dollar national behemoth. Encore Boston Harbor? He built that. Millennium Tower the BU “stack of books” computing center Four Seasons One Dalton Street…yeah he built those too. He is worth just over $1 billion primarily from the estimated value of his company.

How He’s an Ordinary Person: Fish is known to be unfailingly gracious: He sends prompt thank-you notes and often ends phone calls by asking “Is there anything I can do for you?”

How He’s Not an Ordinary Person: For PR maven George Regan’s Cape Cod wedding this summer Fish graciously provided his refurbished tugboat the SS Lollipop to ferry the bride Elizabeth Akeley to her groom and officiant Charlie Baker.

Taking the Lead: There hardly seems to be a significant board in Boston that Fish hasn’t served on if not chaired: Massachusetts Competitive Partnership Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Brigham Health Boston College and the list goes on.

He Uses His Money for Good When He: Donates to Brigham and Women’s Hospital: John and his wife Cynthia have given nearly $20 million to the institution over the years including $2.5 million to start a COVID-19 caregivers’ initiative.

Signature Look: He’s never seen without a tie on even at the ridiculously early hour he is said to start working.

Seth Klarman

CEO Baupost Group

Age: 65

Lives In: Chestnut Hill

How He Made It: At age 25 one of Klarman’s Harvard Business School professors invited him to join a new investment management firm Baupost Group. He was soon bringing 20 percent annual returns to wealthy clients amassing a personal fortune now estimated at $1.5 billion in the process.

How He’s an Ordinary Person: Klarman met his wife Beth on a Boston Harbor cruise. He coached his daughters’ soccer teams.

How He’s Not an Ordinary Person: Legendary football coach Bill Parcells once cited Klarman’s Margin of Safety as the last book he’d read.

Giving from the Heart: After his daughter suffered from an eating disorder Klarman wrote a $2.5 million check for a treatment center at McLean Hospital in addition to providing grants for scientific research on anorexia nervosa. This was through the Klarman Family Foundation which has more than half a billion dollars in assets. The Klarmans are also supporters of Israel and Jewish philanthropies.

Signature Look: Klarman is recognizable in his glasses and trimmed beard.

Fun Things He Owns: Two Preakness-winning horses.

His Politics: He’s a longtime Republican described as fiscally conservative and socially liberal—but so anti-Trump that he has shifted from a major GOP donor to an even bigger Democratic one in recent years including giving thousands to Democratic state parties from Arizona to Florida.

Arthur Winn

Founder WinnCompanies

Age: 83

Lives In: Brookline

How He Made It: Steered toward real estate by a Harvard Business School professor in 1971 Winn stepped into the emerging field of government-subsidized affordable housing and grew one of the biggest companies in the business. His legacy of buildings—mostly for low-income residents—maintain their daily presence in Boston throughout the region and in 23 states across the country.

How He’s an Ordinary Person: According to friends Winn can recite extensive scenes from his favorite films: The Godfather trilogy.

How He’s Not an Ordinary Person: As a student at the University of Massachusetts he launched a business selling formal wear for fraternity functions—which he soon expanded to include corsage sales. fingerprints on the city: Winn’s company transformed Boston’s Mission Main property into a national model for low-cost public housing. He has earned praise throughout his career for developing affordable housing that becomes a part of the community rather than cookie-cutter barracks-style structures.

He Uses His Money for Good When He: Gives to Jewish organizations and causes among other philanthropic activities.

Fun Things He Owns: Red Sox season tickets behind home plate.

His Politics: Winn has been a Republican supporter for decades but has mostly donated to Democrats in recent election cycles.

Why He Flies Under the Radar: His friend and fellow philanthropist Lenny Zakim got a bridge named for him; he didn’t.

Stéphane Bancel

CEO Moderna

Age: 50

Lives In: Beacon Hill

How He Made It: In 2011 not yet 40 years old the France native was hired to run an ambitious Cambridge startup that was trying to use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology to produce new types of medicine. When that company brought forward a successful COVID-19 vaccine Bancel’s already valuable shares in the company soared; he’s now worth $4.6 billion according to Forbes.

How He’s an Ordinary Person: Bancel credits his success to being raised and taught by Jesuits.

How He’s Not an Ordinary Person: Earlier this year he was made a chevalier of the Légion d’Honneur—a knight essentially and France’s highest meritorious honor.

He Uses His Money for Good When He: Funds Boston-area community-focused charities through the Bancel Foundation. His wife Brenda who studied at Harvard’s Divinity School recently launched a second foundation called Champions of Love. And that’s all before the couple announced this year that they will exercise hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of stock options—and sell them all giving the money to charity.

Signature Look: Bancel is usually seen in rimless glasses tailored suits and a buzz cut.

Why You May Not Have Heard of Him: For years Bancel toiled quietly—secretively some say—to turn the promise of mRNA vaccines into a real tested product. Clearly it was a success.

Joshua Bekenstein

Cochair Bain Capital

Age: 64

Lives In: Wayland

How He Made It: Bekenstein was one of the original people from Bain & Company chosen by founder Bill Bain and partner Mitt Romney to start Bain Capital which became one of the most successful investment firms in the country. Much of his wealth comes from his holdings in companies that Bain Capital bought over the years including the Bright Horizons childcare company Waters Corp. Burlington stores and Michaels.

He Uses His Money for Good When He: Backs climate change awareness and mitigation efforts along with his wife Anita. Bekenstein has also funded New Profit a nonprofit that supports “breakthrough social entrepreneurs who are advancing equity and opportunity” especially Black indigenous and Latinx grantees who are often overlooked by philanthropists.

All in Good Fun: As a young man he and other Bain Capital founders goofed around during a photo shoot taking a picture with dollar bills in their hands and mouths. Unfortunately the photo was widely seen years later when the young man in front of Bekenstein—Mitt Romney—was a candidate for president.

Fun Things He Owns: When the Bekensteins get the itch to leave their 10000-square-foot home in Wayland (with stables and a tennis court) they can stretch out at their $18 million house on 14 beachfront acres on Nantucket.

His Politics: The couple are huge funders of Democratic and liberal candidates and committees.

Why He Flies Under the Radar: Bekenstein has never craved attention leaving the spotlight to his former boss Mitt Romney and current cochair Steve Pagliuca.

Niraj Shah

Cofounder Wayfair

Age: 48

Lives In: The Back Bay

How He Made It: The son of immigrants from India Shah attended public high school in Pittsfield before meeting his future business partner Steve Conine at Cornell University. The two eventually went on to create the multibillion-dollar online home furniture store Wayfair. They are each worth an estimated $1.5 billion.

How He’s an Ordinary Person: He furnishes his home with Wayfair purchases of course.

How He’s Not an Ordinary Person: Shah sat on the board of the Boston Fed was once on Fortune magazine’s “40 under 40” list and has been Ernst & Young’s “Entrepreneur of the Year.” He and his wife Jill have also purchased seven adjacent properties at Little Parker’s Pond in the Osterville Village section of Barnstable to develop into a family compound.

He Uses His Money for Good When He: Helps fund public education and healthcare access through the Shah Family Foundation primarily run by Jill. Although it just launched in 2017 the organization is quickly becoming an influential player in Boston.

Signature Look: Round clear-framed glasses and a slightly graying beard.

His Politics: Shah has given extensively to Democrats nationally including six-figure contributions to support Joe Biden in 2020.

Timothy Springer

Investor and immunologist Harvard Medical School

Age: 74

Lives In: Newton

How He Made It: After several other investment successes—he reportedly made $100 million from an earlier drug-development startup LeukoSite—Springer was approached by a colleague for advice on raising capital for a new company. Springer put in $5 million himself which turned into $400 million by the time that company Moderna went public in 2018. Now he’s worth more than $2 billion according to Forbes.

Other wins: Springer has helped create treatments for cancer multiple sclerosis Crohn’s disease and more. He also cofounded (and funded) the Institute for Protein Innovation located at Harvard Medical School which is designing synthetic antibodies for potential scientific research.

Signature Look: Casual. Known to bicycle to work in jeans Springer recently conducted a Zoom interview with this magazine from his office while wearing a white T-shirt.

Fun Things He Owns: He collected several large gongshi rocks from China one a massive 23 tons to decorate the home he built in Newton.

His Politics: After supporting Barack Obama in 2008 Springer had no record of political giving until the 2020 election cycle when he contributed to Jake Auchincloss in his local district’s congressional race. Auchincloss’s parents are both prominent alumni of Harvard Medical School.

Why He Flies Under the Radar: Noubar Afeyan and Stéphane Bancel have gotten most of the Moderna media attention.

Terry Ragon

Founder and CEO InterSystems

Age: 73

Lives In: Cambridge

How He Made It: Way back in 1978 Ragon launched a company to produce data-management software for banks and hospitals. More than 40 years later InterSystems continues to thrive as a privately held company with Ragon as CEO and his wife Susan as VP.

How He’s an Ordinary Person: He and Susan ran their first Boston Marathon as “bandits”—without credentials—in 1993.

How He’s Not an Ordinary Person: The couple just spent a reported $93 million to buy three beachfront properties—two of which were not officially on the market—to build a new Florida home.

He Uses His Money for Good When He: Gives to Mass General including $100 million for AIDS research. And that’s not all: The Ragons have taken the “Giving Pledge” to give away the majority of their money—which totals nearly $2 billion—through philanthropy.

His Politics: The Ragons have contributed more than $6.5 million over the years almost all to Democrats or Democrat-supporting committees. This spring Ragon gave a cool million to the committee working to keep the Democrats’ majority status in the U.S. Senate.

Why He Flies Under the Radar: InterSystems is almost obsessive about being Boston’s quietest major corporation—something that’ll become much more difficult when it moves into its new 420000-square-foot space at the new One Congress Tower.

Steve Conine

Cofounder Wayfair

Age: 50

Lives In: The South End

How He Made It: Partnering in entrepreneurship with Niraj Shah.

How He’s an Ordinary Person: Conine can often be spotted riding his bicycle around Boston.

How He’s Not an Ordinary Person: He competes worldwide in mountain-bike races.

Innovations: Conine has been trying for years to create an AI-driven augmented-reality shopping experience for Wayfair customers.

He Doesn’t Need His Name in Lights: He and Shah recently gave $10 million to build a new computing and information science building at their alma mater Cornell University—but the building will be named for Apple exec Ann Bowers not themselves.

Fun Things He Owns: A brass-and-copper clock that he made himself among other handcrafted pieces.

His Politics: Conine’s largest contributions have been to the national and state GOP but he’s also given to some local Democrats—including Deval Patrick during his brief 2020 presidential campaign.

Alan Trefler

CEO Pegasystems

Age: 66

Lives In: Brookline

How He Made It: The software company he launched at age 27 (with a helpful loan from his mother) is doing more than $1 billion in annual revenue some 40 years later—with him still running it and owning about half the shares.

How He’s an Ordinary Person: Trefler enjoys an occasional game of good old-fashioned Ping-Pong.

How He’s Not an Ordinary Person: He achieved chess-master status and won a world chess championship while still in college.

He Uses His Money for Good When He: Helps kids in underserved communities succeed by supporting STEM education and healthcare needs. He and his wife Pam created the Trefler Foundation in large part to tackle the inequities she observed while teaching math at Dorchester High School (they later gifted $1 million to the school).

Signature Look: He sports a well-trimmed beard that he’s worn since college and prefers a casual jeans-and-polo-shirt getup.

Elizabeth Johnson

Owner Louisburg Farm

Age: 59

Lives In: Beacon Hill

How She Made It: Johnson owns roughly 5 percent of Fidelity the investment management firm created by her grandfather and currently run by her sister Abigail.

How She’s an Ordinary Person: Johnson is constantly being judged in relation to her supposedly more accomplished sibling.

How She’s Not an Ordinary Person: Fidelity created a new investment firm Volition Capital for Johnson’s husband Rob Ketterson to be a founding partner of.

She Uses Her Money for Good When She: Makes considerable charitable contributions directly and via her family’s Edward C. Johnson Fund. She also donates to Boston’s Society of Arts & Crafts.

Fun Things She Owns: An equestrian training facility in Wellington Florida named Louisburg Farm after the tony square where she resides in Boston. When the farm held a fundraiser for U.S. Olympic equestrian teams Bruce Springsteen—whose daughter is an equestrian competitor—cochaired the event and played an impromptu set on a Fender guitar being auctioned off.

Why She Flies Under the Radar: Beth is the Johnson sibling least involved in the family business. She is also the least wealthy according to Forbes hovering above the $5 billion line this summer.

Edward Johnson IV

President Pembroke Real Estate

Age: 57

Where He Lives: The North End

How He Made It: As the brother of Fidelity chief Abigail Johnson Ed IV owns roughly 5 percent of the huge investment management firm—and runs a subsidiary of the empire.

How He’s an Ordinary Person: He majored in “recreational and leisure studies” at Northeastern University.

How He’s Not an Ordinary Person: He manages 2.2 million square feet at Seaport Place which is owned by his real estate company a branch of—surprise surprise—Fidelity.

Signature Look: His cherubic red hair.

Why He Flies Under the Radar: Johnson who is reportedly worth upward of $6 billion is just as media-averse as his namesake father and grandfather as well as his powerful sister Abigail. And without that top position at Fidelity he has far fewer people trying to put him in the spotlight.

George Sakellaris

Chairman and CEO Ameresco

Age: 76

Lives In: Milton

How He Made It: Sakellaris amassed a fortune in the 1980s and 1990s retrofitting other companies’ buildings for energy efficiency and getting paid out of their resulting savings.

Fun and Games: He reportedly participated in an annual $1 million fantasy football league with nine other rich guys.

He Uses His Money for Good When He: Shares his wealth with a wide range of local institutions including Big Brothers Big Sisters and the Institute of Contemporary Art.

Claire Hughes Johnson

Corporate officer and Adviser Stripe

USCHO Weekend Review What did we learn from the first weekend of the 2022-23 season?

Marquee Matchup?:

Plenty of eyes will be on the “State of Hockey” this weekend when second-ranked Minnesota and fifth-ranked Minnesota State square off in a non-conference home-and-home series. It will be the first regular-season action of the season for Minnesota State which opened the year with an exhibition loss at Omaha last Saturday. The Gophers meanwhile opened 2022-23 with a home sweep of Lindenwood last weekend at 3M Arena at Mariucci.

Breaking the Ice:

This weekend’s annual Ice Breaker Tournament will be co-hosted by Air Force and top-ranked Denver at Cadet Ice Arena and Magness Arena respectively. It’s the first time in the tournament’s 26-year history that multiple schools will serve as hosts. Maine and No. 9/11 Notre Dame are also participating in this year’s tournament.

Lindenwood Lore:

One of the two newest teams on the Division I men’s hockey scene Lindenwood took to the ice for the first time as a DI program last weekend at defending Big Ten regular-season champion Minnesota.

The Lions dropped a 4-0 decision Saturday before following up with a 6-4 setback the following night. Sophomore forward Kyle Jeffers (Oviedo Fla.) scored the first Division I goal in program history when he struck on the power play late in the opening period. Classmates David Gagnon (Halifax Nova Scotia) and Caleb Price (Hooksett N.H.) drew the assists on the historic goal.

The Lions will face another Big Ten test this weekend when they return to the road at No. 6/7 Michigan.

Very Nice to Sea You:

Following a two-year program hiatus Alaska Anchorage returned with a flourish last weekend defeating No. 12/14 Western Michigan 3-1 on Friday. The Seawolves were the only team in the country last weekend to claim a win over a nationally ranked opponent the program’s first-such victory since the 2015-16 campaign.

“The win tonight was for all the people who helped bring the program back” said UAA head coach and Seawolf alum Matt Shasby.

Stonehill to Make DI Debut:

Stonehill College the other new Division I men’s program this season will make its debut Saturday when the Skyhawks host Long Island at Bridgewater Ice Arena. Stonehill led by head coach David Borges (UMass Lowell ’85) will compete as a Division I independent in 2022-23.

Josh Ciocco

The college hockey community is mourning the passing of Merrimack assistant coach and former New Hampshire captain Josh Ciocco who also spent time as an assistant coach at Brown and Alaska Anchorage. Josh was a very good friend of College Hockey Inc. and a wonderful person. Our hearts go out to Josh’s family and friends.

Fries at the Bottom of the Bag:

A trio of first-year Division I head coaches earned their first collegiate victories in their debuts last weekend: UAA’s Shasby Boston University’s Jay Pandolfo (vs. Bentley) and Union’s Josh Hauge (vs. RIT) … More than four dozen sons of former NHLers are playing NCAA Division I hockey in 2022-23.

The contract announced Tuesday is worth up to $176 million and the satellites are set to fly beginning in 2024.

NExT is not part of the NDSA Tranche architecture but will demonstrate low-latency data transport and beyond line-of-sight command and control. NExT will experiment with the infrastructure established by the Tranche 1 Transport Layer (T1TL) to field and connect additional space vehicles with different mission payload configurations. According to the program solicitation the satellites will include optical communications terminals.

SDA said the experimental testbed will be used to demonstrate the utility of “emerging mission partner payloads” before they are potentially incorporated in future tranches of the NDSA. SDA Director Derek Tournear commented that NExT will advance future tranches of the NDSA.

Ball Aerospace is the prime contractor on the project and Ball will integrate government-furnished payloads and operate the NExT satellites from the company’s facilities in Colorado.

“Ball Aerospace is leveraging our heritage and proven experience of assembly integration and test of complex payloads while bringing together an innovative industry team to quickly deliver needed capabilities to ensure SDA mission success” commented Dave Kaufman president Ball Aerospace.

The National Defense Space Architecture is an ecosystem of hundreds of satellites operating in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO). It will comprise seven capability layers for performing data communications tracking hypersonic and cruise missiles and providing enhanced battle management navigation ground support and deterrence from space.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEwL21pY2hhZWwtYmFsbC1hc3BlY3RzLW9mLWxvdmUtcmVpbWFnaW5lZC1hbmRyZXctbGxveWQtd2ViYmVyLW11c2ljYWwtbG92ZS1jaGFuZ2VzLWV2ZXJ5dGhpbmctMTIzNTEzNDg4NC_SAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC9taWNoYWVsLWJhbGwtYXNwZWN0cy1vZi1sb3ZlLXJlaW1hZ2luZWQtYW5kcmV3LWxsb3lkLXdlYmJlci1tdXNpY2FsLWxvdmUtY2hhbmdlcy1ldmVyeXRoaW5nLTEyMzUxMzQ4ODQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Love Changes Everything: Michael Ball Will Revisit ‘Aspects Of Love’ In A Reimagined Version Of Andrew Lloyd Webber Musical,"EXCLUSIVE: Three decades ago Michael Ball (Les Miserables) had teeny-bopper groupies waiting for him at the stage door — in London and on Broadway — thanks to a heartthrob role in Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical Aspects of Love. It didn’t hurt that Ball got to belt out “Love Changes Everything” which was a hit on both sides of the Atlantic.

Ball will star in a new production of the musical and will sing that song again.

Aspects of Love is set to open in May at London’s Lyric Theatre owned by Nimax Theatres a company controlled by Nica Burns and producer Max Weitzenhoffer. Burns will produce.

Ball is the first to acknowledge that he no longer can play the youthful Alex Dillingham the part he created in the original production in 1989 at the Prince of Wales Theatre. During a recent reception at that very same theater Ball told Deadline that while he won’t take on Alex again he will play the part of George his aristocratic uncle.

The men both have affairs with Parisian actress Rose Vibert and there are further episodes of troubled desires and tangled emotions hence its title.

”I’m playing George and I’m going to sing ‘Love Changes Everything’” Ball told us.

How so?

”It’s going to be a completely reimagined show” he said. “You won’t recognize it.”

Lloyd Webber might write a new song for the reimagined production.

Jonathan Kent who directed Imelda Staunton (The Crown) and Ball in an award-winning production of Stephen Sondheim’s Sweeney Todd will direct the new Aspects of Love.

Producer Burns will arrange for Kent Ball Lloyd Webber and the show’s songwriters Don Black and Charles Hart to gather for a workshop in London before the end of the year. Under Kent’s direction it will explore how to reassess Aspects of Love including how to structure the piece so that Ball as George can perform “Love Changes Everything.”

Lloyd Webber wrote the musical’s original book adapted from David Garnett’s 1955 novella. Ball and Kent are keen to strip it of its more saccharin moments that were fine 30 years ago but would sink it now.

Along with Ball the original 1989 company included Ann Crumb as Rose and Kevin Colson as George.

Colson was a last-minute replacement for Roger Moore who had been picked by Lloyd Webber and original director Trevor Nunn to play George. However during rehearsals it became clear that Moore couldn’t carry a tune and couldn’t possibly carry on with the show. He withdrew and went off skiing in the Swiss Alps.

Aspects of Love will preview at the Lyric Theatre on London’s Shaftesbury Avenue from May 12 and opening night will be May 25. The show has been booked to run for 26 weeks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvbGxpbmdzdG9uZS5jb20vbXVzaWMvbXVzaWMtZmVhdHVyZXMvcm9nZXItd2F0ZXJzLXVrcmFpbmlhbi1raWxsLWxpc3QtMTIzNDYwNDA4MS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Roger Waters Says He Is on 'a Ukrainian 'Kill List',"Roger Waters does not want you to ignore his politics. The 79-year-old’s This Is Not A Drill Tour opens with Waters imitating a plummy British announcer and telling the audience: “If you’re one of those ‘I love Pink Floyd but I can’t stand Roger’s politics’ people you might do well to fuck off to the bar right now. Thank you and please enjoy the show.”

Waters certainly has a lot of politics. He is a vocal supporter of a free Palestine and Black Lives Matter and has spoken out against right-wing demagogues including Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and former U.S. President Donald Trump.

He has also accused the Syrian rescue group the White Helmets of being “fake” against all evidence to the contrary; said the Syrian opposition faked chemical attacks by Bashar al-Assad a contention no credible independent expert agrees with; and recently wrote an open letter to the Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska calling on her to encourage her husband to sue for peace with Russia — a move that would be tantamount to acquiescing to Putin. (In our interview he dismisses well-documented accounts of Russian war crimes in Ukraine as “lies lies lies.”)

What he sees as his advocacy for Palestine has for some crossed the line from legitimate criticism into bigotry whether deliberate or otherwise. Waters’ previous shows have had for example giant pigs emblazoned with the Star of David alongside other symbols. Waters has repeatedly insisted his problem is Israel not with Jews more broadly. However as we discuss the subject during our interview Waters argues that some Jewish people in the U.S. and U.K. bear responsibility for the actions of Israel “particularly because they pay for everything.” Editor’s picks

Waters wants his public to accept him — his music politics and all and to take it seriously — and so Rolling Stone dispatched me an investigative journalist to interview him. (To hear an audio version of the full interview press play above or listen on Apple Podcasts or Spotify.)

Waters says most of us are fed our narratives instead of being able to independently come to our own conclusions by the “completely controlled” media which is “monopolized by the powers that be and by the government … oh my God Rolling Stone must be part of it.”

That compliant media he continues feeds us the idea that Russia and China are evil and we by contrast are good. He sees things very differently.

“Of course we — when I say we I’m now speaking as a taxpayer in the United States — are not. We are the most evil of all by a factor of at least 10 times” he says. “We kill more people. We interfere in more people’s elections. We the American empire is doing all this shit.”

This factor of 10 idea I suggest might not play all that well to any citizen of Ukraine right now — especially given the mounting evidence of war crimes we’ve seen including mass graves the use of rape as a weapon of war targeting humanitarian convoys and more.

“You’ve seen it on what I’ve just described to you as Western propaganda” he retorts. “It’s exactly the obverse of saying Russian propaganda; Russians interfered with our election; Russians did that. It’s all lies lies lies lies.”

I try to push gingerly through Waters’ brick wall. I haven’t just seen things via corporate media I say — I’ve got friends in Ukraine and friends who went to Ukraine as journalists. I’ve even got friends who are Ukrainian journalists. I’m relying on testimony of people I know who’ve seen things with their own eyes. And it’s not only Ukrainian officials and Western media reporting atrocities — there are war crimes investigations already underway.

This does not go far with Waters. “Maybe…” he wonders before throwing a curveball. “Don’t forget I’m on a kill list that is supported by the Ukrainian government. I’m on the fucking list and they’ve killed people recently.… But when they kill you they write ‘liquidated’ across your picture. Well I’m one of those fucking pictures.”

“And when I read stuff which I have done in blogs and things criticizing me for my … I always go and look and see where it came from. And it’s amazing how often when I’ve done the hunt and hunted it down it is da da da.ukraine.org” he says making up a hypothetical Ukrainian web address.

Waters’ claim isn’t true but it isn’t completely false either. There is a list maintained by a far-right Ukrainian organization that contains hundreds of thousands of enemies of Ukraine from alleged members of the Wagner private military company to journalists accused of cooperating with puppet governments in the Donbas region. The site which has been roundly internationally condemned — but not taken down by the Ukrainian government itself — claims not to be a kill list but rather “information for law enforcement authorities and special services.”

The impressive visuals for Waters’ tour at one point flash up the message “You can’t have occupation and human rights.” “I want[ed] to put ‘Fuck the Israeli occupation’ he says … and then ‘Oh no the words are too long.’” – Given that message what is it that makes opposing Israel’s occupation of Palestine a worthy cause but Ukrainian resistance against Russian invasion a bad one?

“Because it’s an unnecessary war” he says. “And those people should not be dying. And Russia should not have been encouraged to invade the Ukraine [Waters insists he is not making a political point by saying “the Ukraine”] after they tried for 20 years to avoid it by suggesting diplomatic measures to Western governments.”

In other words it’s NATO’s fault that Putin decided to invade Ukraine.

We’ve reached an impasse and I’m left no more sure whether resisting Russia’s invasion is wrong because it risks nuclear escalation — suggesting human rights are only worth fighting for when it’s low-risk — or whether it’s wrong because Russia should be allowed its sphere of influence which seems a return not just to imperialism but also to Great Game politics.

We need to move on I suggest because it’s important to talk about Syria too. Waters has repeatedly condemned U.S. intervention in Syria which was initially based on not only tackling ISIS but also supporting secular resistance to Bashar al-Assad. I note that by 2017 the U.S. had carried out 11235 strikes on Syria — but during the same period Russia admitted to 71000 strikes.

“There’s a slight difference in that they were there at the invitation of the Syrian government” Waters quickly notes. I wonder aloud whether the government of Bashar al-Assad which was elected with 95.1 percent of the vote in the latest ‘election’ is really a legitimate one. Predictably Waters has a counterpoint: “I mean there’s no fair elections in the United States because it’s all bought and paid for because of Citizens United.”

Reminding myself that Waters professes that the core of his political philosophy is the U.N. declaration of human rights I try again. “A friend of mine who lives here [in the U.K.] now was beaten and tortured he was electrocuted in Assad’s cells” I tell Waters. “And most of the opposition in Syria is nothing like ISIS. It’s driven by secular people who want freedom. And Assad and Russia have bombed them into oblivion and tortured them and forced them out of the country…”

Waters demurs to the possibility that this happens and agrees to take it on trust that my friend was indeed tortured. But we are quickly back to the suggestion that chemical attacks in Syria against the opposition were staged — partly because Waters claims Assad would have no motive to do so as it would encourage the West to intervene even though in reality it didn’t. Waters has “spent a great deal of time studying it” and is satisfied with his conclusions.

“I can live with myself and go to sleep at night knowing that the story that is being sold by the Western media is propaganda and it is not the truth. I know the truth” he says. “And I’m sure I’m right about that. The rest of it your mate who was tortured I’m sure you are right. I’m not sure you are right but I would be prepared to believe you.”

As we flounder I ask Waters what his politics actually are — what unifies these often extreme and incongruent views? “Politically my platform is very small” he says. “It’s just the declaration of universal human rights in Paris in 1948. All 29 or 30 articles however many there are.”

Beyond the 30 articles of the U.N.’s declaration of human rights Waters professes only one more core political concept — that of “the bar” a “safe place” where people can “exchange our feelings and ideas freely and frankly without fear of retribution.”

If Waters and I are in the “bar” it’s a pretty fractious dive bar at best. Waters is charming and courteous but our conversation repeatedly generates into animated shouting and interruption — and that’s before we inevitably get to the issue of Israel.

“I’m absolutely not antisemitic absolutely not” Waters says. “That hasn’t stopped all the assholes trying to smear me with being an antisemite.”

What follows is a back-and-forth as we try to establish some basics. Waters doesn’t accept the standard IHRA (International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance) definition of antisemitism. Does the state of Israel have a right to exist? “Saying Israel does not have a right to exist as an apartheid state any more than South Africa did or anywhere else would is not antisemitic” Waters counters.

Waters says what he criticizes is “the fact that they are a supremacist settler colonialist project that operates a system of apartheid.” This quickly descends into ancient history — the Jewish people have a history in the region of Israel that goes back millennia I say. Doesn’t that make “settler” quite an offensive term? “No it’s not. Those people are not from there. They are not the descendants of indigenous people who’ve ever lived there.” This is not only untrue for many Israeli citizens it also serves to minimize the horror and suffering that came before the founding of Israel and the desire for a Jewish homeland that instilled.

I try to tackle one more question relating to Israel. In 2020 Waters sang the lyric “We’ll walk hand in hand and we’ll take back the land from the Jordan river to the sea.” Was Waters aware that “from the river to the sea” is a term often used to describe either the destruction of Israel or the relocation of all of Israel’s Jewish population to somewhere else — and thus received with horror by many Israeli people and Jewish people alike?

“No bollocks. It’s just a geographical description of the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. It has no connotation for me apart from that” he says. “Nobody’s suggesting that they all have to leave which is what they suggested to the indigenous people there in 1948.”

I wrap up the interview shortly afterwards — with neither of us having convinced the other of anything. Waters’ live show repeatedly flashes up one particular message that clearly compels him: “Control the narrative rule the world.”

I leave the interview thinking it’s almost the opposite: Waters is an example of how we can construct our own narrative and twist the world to fit in with no amount of mainstream media propaganda or even real-world facts and evidence able to let any light in. It leads us to a nihilistic place where we are only able to feel compassion for victims that fit our personal narrative minimising or even actively denying the suffering of others. It’s sufficiently bleak that I feel almost wistful for a world with a shared narrative even if it’s one controlled by a oh-so-malign media.

Roger Waters and I have managed to avoid having a bar fight. But as I leave I know one thing for sure: I really need a drink.

Lack of technical knowledge coupled with high upfront costs of implementation create barriers for family forest owners to access the carbon market. The Family Forest Carbon Program tackles these challenges by providing small landowners professional guidance educational support and financial assistance to actively engage in forestry practices that improve forest health and increase carbon sequestration and storage unlocking their financial potential in the carbon market. The program plans to adapt and grow its offerings in the Southern United States to ensure enrollment in the program mirrors the demographics of the counties in which it is operating.

“The Family Forest Carbon Program is mobilizing small woodlot owners to help expand the role of forests in tackling climate change” said Rich Brown Environmental Program director at Bank of America. “By supporting this program we are helping to expand this innovative initiative while also directly building more equitable solutions and economic opportunities for minority landowners. The goal is to enable minority landowners to be at the forefront of sustainability efforts and part of a larger carbon market solution.”

Thirty-nine percent of U.S. forests are owned by families and individuals the largest portion of our country’s woodlands with roughly seven percent (PDF) cared for by minority landowners. Bank of America’s support will help provide underserved family forest owners across the southern United States with financial support to improve forest health and help address climate change through their woodlands. The funds will be focused on research development and adaptation programs.

The Family Forest Carbon Program is currently enrolling landowners in Massachusetts Maryland New York Pennsylvania Vermont and West Virginia with plans to expand enrollment into the South in early 2023. The grant from Bank of America will support underserved family forest owners in North Carolina and South Carolina.

NEW YORK Oct. 4 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Today Merrill Wealth Management launched Merrill Advisor Match a research-based digital platform that connects people seeking financial advice with a Merrill financial advisor who best fits their preferences and needs.

Data shows there is a need for a modern approach for finding an advisor. A third of affluent Americans are not working with an advisor today. They cite the following reasons why:

Mobile screenshots of Merrill Advisor Match

22% say they don't know how to find the right advisor

14% say reaching out to an advisor is intimidating and

10% say they can't find one who understands their unique needs.1

Merrill Advisor Match solves for this need by offering a simple set of questions to answer serving up a personalized list of advisors and providing the option for the prospect to digitally schedule a meeting with the advisor of their choice.

""We've combined a century of bringing Wall Street to Main Street with a personalized digital experience that takes the guesswork out of finding the right advisor"" said Andy Sieg President of Merrill Wealth Management. ""Merrill Advisor Match is an industry-changing innovation that reflects our modern Merrill strategy helping to connect more investors to advice from the best advisors in the industry.""

According to a recent Merrill survey affluent Americans prioritize working with an advisor who matches their communication style (90%) and personality (83%) nearly as much as one who delivers financial results (93%).1

The intuitive questionnaire and technology behind Merrill Advisor Match were developed and informed by in-depth interviews focus groups and quantitative surveys with advisors and clients. The tool matches people to advisors based on multiple dimensions including:

Engagement preferences to understand how a prospective client would like to meet and interact with their advisor (e.g. frequency of meetings proximity to advisor level of proactivity);

to understand how a prospective client would like to meet and interact with their advisor (e.g. frequency of meetings proximity to advisor level of proactivity); Guidance style to assess prospective clients' preference on how they communicate with their advisor receive recommendations and how decisions are reached; and

to assess prospective clients' preference on how they communicate with their advisor receive recommendations and how decisions are reached; and Personality traits to inform the best client-advisor pairing (e.g. introvert vs. extrovert approach to problem solving).

""Recommendations from family and friends will forever be an important way people are introduced to an advisor. However most people who aren't working with an advisor 62% would be the first in their family to have an advisor relationship"" said Kirstin Hill Merrill Chief Operating Officer. ""For those who don't have a connection in their personal network Merrill Advisor Match uses research and qualitative analysis to break down barriers to professional financial advice.""

The new tool is becoming available at a time when the demand for financial advice is high. The combination of the global pandemic coupled with the most volatile markets in decades is accelerating the desire for affluent Americans to find an advisor they can trust to help them achieve their goals.1

1 Concentrix (an independent market research company) conducted a panel-sample online survey on behalf of Bank of America/Merrill from July 22 – August 4 2022. The survey consisted of 1095 affluent respondents throughout the U.S. Respondents in the study were aged 18 to 99 with investable assets of $250000 and above. For this purpose investable assets consist of the value of all cash savings mutual funds CDs IRAs stocks bonds and all other types of investments such as a 401(k) 403(B) and Roth IRA but excluding primary home and other real estate investments. The margin of error is +/- 2.96% reported at a 95% confidence level. Using the same survey Concentrix also oversampled of Black/African American Hispanic and LGBTQ+ respondents in order to achieve enough surveys to ensure a robust sample size for analysis. The total sample sizes of 484 Black/African American 340 Hispanic and 416 LGBTQ+ have a margin of error of +/- 4.45% 5.31% and 4.80% respectively.

Having run both businesses and client-relationship organizations Emily Portney chief financial officer of BNY Mellon brings a well-rounded vision to her oversight of the firm's finance functions which include tax treasury capital management and investor relations — where she regularly articulates and advocates the value of the franchise to the public.

Prior to becoming CFO in July 2020 Emily led the global client coverage organization for asset servicing BNY Mellon's largest business where she was responsible for end-to-end client experience and long-term revenue growth in diverse market segments such as hedge funds insurance companies pension plans and endowments.

BNY Mellon recently embarked on an effort co-sponsored by Portney targeted at reducing bureaucracy and increasing efficiency across the firm. The effort requires the entire 50000-person company to challenge and change how many areas operate by attacking old bureaucratic processes and ways of thinking. To assist with the program Emily and her co-sponsor took several dozen high-potential employees out of their day jobs for several months.

In an i nterview with Bloomberg  Portney said that the management of digital assets could create a meaningful source of revenue for BNY Mellon as early as 2023-24. However several regulatory hurdles that need to be overcome in the short term before her organization can ""lead the charge"" into the cryptocurrency business. ""There are proposals in front of the Securities and Exchange Commission that haven't yet been approved on whether ETFs can actually hold digital assets directly versus futures"" she said. She says she's optimistic regulators will provide better clarity to the markets in the near future.

Portney is a tireless advocate for talent development with an emphasis on diversity and teaching employees new digital and other skills.

She will soon be taking on a new role with BNY Mellon where she is set to lead the bank's treasury and credit services in addition to its clearance and collateral management functions. She will remain on the BNY Mellon executive committee and continue to report to the firm's CEO.

For the last 15 years Portney has been a leading supporter of Cycle for Survival which raises funds for rare cancer research at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. In 2021 she founded a global BNY Mellon team to participate in the then-virtual fundraiser and this year established the first in-person BNY cycling team.

Since 2017 she has been a board director of MarketAxess Holdings a leading electronic bond trading platform for institutional investors that has long been at the forefront in transforming and democratizing the global bond market.

Portney is a champion for greater access to higher education; this year she founded an undergraduate scholarship award at her alma mater Duke University in honor of her mother. The scholarship is designated specifically for exceptional students who are in need of financial aid.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtZXJpY2FuYmFua2VyLmNvbS9uZXdzL21vc3QtcG93ZXJmdWwtd29tZW4taW4tYmFua2luZy1uby03LWthcmVuLXBlZXR6LWNpdGlncm91cNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Most Powerful Women in Banking: No. 7 Karen Peetz Citigroup,"Enjoy complimentary access to top ideas and insights — selected by our editors.

When Karen Peetz joined Citi in 2020 she was returning to work after three and a half years of retirement from a career that included leadership positions at Bank of New York Mellon where she led the financial markets and treasury services group and at JPMorgan Chase where she had a variety of commercial lending sales and management positions.

Just four months into her new job Citi was hit with two consent orders and a $400 million civil penalty for its ""longstanding failure to establish effective risk management"" according to federal regulators.

In cooperation with newly appointed CEO Jane Fraser Peetz spent 2021 working to fix those problems to regulators' satisfaction. The effort called ""The Transformation"" is Citi's effort to modernize the bank across regions businesses and functions in ways that both address regulator concerns and make sense for Citi's ongoing businesses. ""We're building a better bank for the long term"" Peetz said. ""There are lots of moving parts and lots of big rocks to move.""

Peetz is leading a cross-enterprise effort to address the root causes of problems while also automating and simplifying company processes. Making sure that Citi has the proper controls in place is just one part of the job.

Improving data governance including evaluating existing data and labeling it consistently is also a significant part of the project. So is redesigning key processes. Before this effort began different parts of Citi's enormous operation had their own processes such as cross-border payments. Peetz's team is turning these multiple methods into single simplified end-to-end processes that score well against benchmarks. The business is also updating its systems and training teams on the new technology.

Citi is taking a double-pronged approach to how it manages risk going forward. On the one hand Peetz is creating a centrally-led discipline and structure to Citi's project management practices. On the other hand she's also working to reset the bank's cultural approach to employees by expecting workers to take ownership for managing risk and controls.

For Peetz the result has been an unexpected capstone experience.

""This is my 40th year in banking"" she said. ""There aren't too many other Citi leaders with that many years under their belts. I worked at Chase and at BNY Mellon I was on the board of Wells Fargo and then I came to Citi.""

When she came out of her 2016 retirement to take her current job with Citi it felt like a culminating experience for her. ""How could I not do it?"" she asked. ""It's been a way to pull together every experience I ever had in the prior 38 years. Who gets a chance to do that?""

As Peetz looks back on 2021 she says that she's most proud of how Citi employees both new and long established have come together to work as a single team. ""I'm a people person and I love human motivation focus teamwork and leadership"" she said. ""Work can be arduous but I get a buzz out of the people part of it. There's a fierce determination and a real never-say-die spirit.""

Peetz is confident that Citi will come out of this experience as a better more efficient organization. That's in part because her team has senior support and recognition she said including a transformation oversight committee and applause for each milestone met.

Peetz's confidence and self-assurance can be attributed in part to her early years as an athlete. ""I played field hockey and lacrosse during the first year of Title IX at Penn State"" she said noting that she had athletic scholarships for both sports. ""I started in 1973 and had quite a feminist coach for both sports. She felt that we were equal and by golly we would be treated that way. When the football team got new uniforms we got new uniforms. It created a sense in me of 'Why wouldn't I get to do the things I want to do?'""

It operates across more than 200 countries has 11000-plus financial institution clients and transmits some 8.4 billion financial messages every year. It is the global leader in cross-border bank-to-bank payments and recently played a key role in the West’s economic sanctions on Russia.

That doesn’t mean the Belgium-based cooperative is immune to disruption tremors however. Critics have long maintained the interbank messaging system founded in the 1970s is “old inflexible slow and increasingly prone to cyberattacks.” In May Mastercard CEO Michael Miebach cast doubt upon SWIFT’s ability to survive the next five years. Meanwhile it continues to be menaced by a rising tide of blockchain-based payment networks on one side and an expected torrent of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) on the other.

But last week in a sign that even entrenched legacy financial networks can (possibly) change their stripes SWIFT confirmed a proof-of-concept project with blockchain oracle provider Chainlink. If all goes well SWIFT’s bank users could easily access and transfer digital assets on multiple blockchain platforms. Days earlier SWIFT also announced it was using fintech-firm Symbiont’s enterprise blockchain platform to improve its messaging for corporate events like dividend payments and mergers.

These developments raise an intriguing question: Rather than engaging in a zero-sum struggle to the death are traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) firms actually converging — i.e. moving toward a common middle ground that includes tokenized assets DeFi interoperability and yes regulation?

Co-opting an existential threat?

“All financial goods will move across blockchain networks in the future” Matthew Hougan chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management told Cointelegraph. “It’s not surprising to see legacy firms looking to adopt and/or co-opt a technology that represents a fundamental threat to their existence; in fact it should be applauded.”

Of course this is just a pilot program. Hougan added “It’s not like SWIFT got blockchain religion overnight and is converting all their activities to DLT.” But it’s a start and for that the network should be applauded he suggested.

In this rapidly evolving technological world “there is no place for binary viewpoints that embrace an ‘I win you lose’ mentality” especially within its capital markets and finance sector Mark Smith CEO and co-founder of Symbiont told Cointelegraph further adding:

“Ultimately what ends up being the norm is usually a hybrid and we definitely see a melding unfolding that will borrow from the best that TradFi and DeFi have to offer.”

Jonathan Solé strategy director at SWIFT speaking at last week’s Smartcon 2022 convention in New York acknowledged an “undeniable interest” on the part of institutional investors in digital assets “whether these are stablecoins CBDCs or anything that you can tokenize on the capital markets space” including equities and bonds.

Banks and other TradFi institutions are looking to SWIFT to “bridge the gap” between their infrastructure servicers like exchanges custodians and clearing houses “and all of these new blockchains that are going to provide these services” for tokenized assets he added at a panel titled “Bridging Traditional Finance and DeFi.”

The session was moderated by Chainlink CEO Sergey Nazarov who noted that SWIFT possessed the TradFi world’s “largest private key infrastructure” adding:

“There is no reason to get rid of that private key infrastructure that already securely signs transactions to move around trillions of dollars in value. All of those standards can simply have an addition made to them that says: blockchain stuff.”

But SWIFT “doesn't necessarily want to build an integration with every single chain on the planet” added Nazarov which was why it was exploring Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) as a way for it “to become interoperable across all blockchain environments.”

Stephen Prosperi head of product management and digital securities management of DTCC which provides clearance and settlement services for U.S. securities markets — another TradFi heavyweight — seconded this point. Different digital currencies “will live across different chains” and firms like DTCC don’t want to build separate infrastructure to connect to each of the 100 blockchains that host desirable digital assets. A central point of entry like CCIP could therefore be useful.

Are cross-chain bridges secure?

The Smartcon panelists didn’t really address some of the challenges associated with cross-chain bridges however including security concerns. “Yes there are security risks with cross-chain projects” commented Hougan “which is why you need pilot projects like this.”

Cross-chain bridges are designed to solve the problem of interoperability between blockchain platforms. Blockchain networks today — Bitcoin Ethereum Solana and others — are like the railroad systems in the 19th century before track gauge sizes were standardized. Passengers and freight had to be offloaded to another train when incompatible rail lines met.

Cross-blockchain bridges are designed to solve these sorts of incompatibilities but the problem is they appear to be vulnerable to hacks. Some $2 billion has been stolen from bridges in 13 separate heists according to Chainalysis most of it this year. Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin too red-flagged cross-chain bridges recently suggesting they can enable 51% network attacks.

A key problem seems to be that the “bridges” tend to accumulate large amounts of “locked assets” from different blockchains some quite obscure and not always built with advanced security features according to Elliptic’s Cross-Chain Report 2022 released Oct. 4 which noted:

“This has made bridges an attractive target for cybercriminals. [...] From January to July 2022 $1.2 billion worth of cryptoassets were stolen across eight bridge compromise incidents.”

Chainlink presumably believes it will do a better job with security than cross-chain bridges have done in the past. Nazarov said as much in post-Smartcom interviews. “That is what CCIP seeks to solve. And I don’t think it’s an intractable problem. I think it’s a solvable problem” he told Fortune.

Are traditional institutions ready for tokenization?

Apart from the need for interoperability are there other commonalities that are bringing TradFi and blockchain providers closer together? Are the capital markets ready for tokenization for instance Nazarov asked panelists.

“Well it’s definitely here. It is not going to go away” answered Solé. “We have adopted all of our messaging standards so that we can make sure that we can cater for the information that is needed for tokenized assets.”

“We’re actually looking at tokenizing all different types of assets internally” Victor O’Laughlen managing director and head of enterprise tokenization at Bank of New York Mellon (BNY) told the panel. BNY’s broker-dealer and investment manager clients “don't want to segregate and manage their assets in different pools. They want to have one client experience.” Another attraction of blockchain-enabled tokenized assets is that they are accessible 24/7. O’Laughlen added:

“It’s the infrastructure that always stays up right? The crypto markets have really pushed the financial markets to think about that. And we need to be able to support our clients at any time zone in any location.”

Beyond interoperability and tokenization there was some interest among the TradFi representatives in DeFi projects proper — but with caveats. “If financial services want to go into DeFi mode there needs to be some sort of regulated DeFi” said Solé though some might view that as a contradiction in terms.

Prosperi echoed the need for a sort of “permissioned DeFi” one that had compliance baked in. “At the end of the day institutions need to feel like they're not going to get busted on KYC AML — that they know who they’re transacting with.”

BNY Mellon’s O’Laughlen saw some positives with DeFi protocols though. “DeFi could benefit intraday liquidity where liquidity is needed to sort of grease the wheels.” Institutions could begin with lending or borrowing assets or cash as “some of the more vanilla types of [DeFi] transactions that take place between counterparties and financial institutions would be a great first step.”

A boost to crypto adoption

Finally what if anything does all this have to do with crypto/blockchain adoption? Ecumenical panel discussions like what occurred at Smartcon are encouraging but will partnerships like SWIFT-Chainlink really “accelerate the adoption of DLT blockchains and benefit various institutions all over the capital markets” as Nazarov suggested?

“It’s positive news” Hougan told Cointelegraph. “Every time an entrenched incumbent recognizes that it has to think about the implications of blockchain technology it makes it easier for the next one to do so. This is another brick in the wall.”

“Chainlink has a strong competitive position in providing oracles and trustless data sources and it grows by integrating those tools into more capital markets and payments networks” Lex Sokolin head economist at ConsenSys told Cointelegraph. “The purposes of blockchains are different and varied. Generally I do think more integration implies more paths to adoption.”

Smith for his part sees a “real maturation” of blockchain technology across financial services viewing it as the “connective tissue” that will make both TradFi and DeFi successful. Blockchain technology was created originally to provide a better bank payment system and 13 years later it “continues to become more widely accepted and adopted among banks asset managers and global markets” Smith said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtZXJpY2FuYmFua2VyLmNvbS9uZXdzL21vc3QtcG93ZXJmdWwtd29tZW4tdG8td2F0Y2gtbm8tMTgtYm55cy1wYXVsZXR0ZS1tdWxsaW5ncy1icmFkbm9ja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Most Powerful Women to Watch: No. 18 BNY's Paulette Mullings Bradnock,"Enjoy complimentary access to top ideas and insights — selected by our editors.

The Baxter City Council met Tuesday Oct. 4 and discussed an improvement project that includes the reclamation of:



Clearwater Road from Inglewood to Edgewood drives

Cedar Scenic Road from Oakwood Drive to Memorywood Drive

Oakwood Drive from Cedar Scenic Road to Michelle Circle

1520 feet of Joler Road from Briarwood Lane

Forest Drive from Excelsior Road to Clearwater Road

1040 feet of Fox Road from Forest Drive

200 feet of Fox Place from Forest Drive.

Road reclamation is a lower cost method of improving roads. The process involves breaking down the road material already in place and recycling it into new pavement for the road involved.

There will also be an extension of two paved trails along the south side of Clearwater Road from Inglewood to Edgewood drives and along the north side of Cedar Scenic Road from Brownsville Circle to Memorywood Drive.

The proposed projects are all preliminary and residents in these areas are invited to an open house at 6 p.m. Thursday Oct. 20 to learn more about it.

The plans were originally presented to the council Sept. 20 with two council members absent. It was presented again on Oct. 4 in front of the whole council. Mayor Darrel Olson also encouraged all the council members to attend the open house if they could.

The potential trail extension on Cedar Scenic Road is depicted with a blue line in the map shown. Contributed

The roads affected would involve resurfacing the roads to the same width. The project roads will remain as rural ditch sections except for the east and west ends of Clearwater Road. Clearwater Road will have a curb and gutter in place instead of the rural ditch sections.

As of Oct. 4 no sanitary sewer and minimal water main improvements are necessary city officials noted. The trails being built are intended to be 10 feet wide and at least 20-25 feet offset from the curb of roadways.

At the end of the discussion regarding the trails it was decided the trail on Clearwater Road would have to be separated from the street if the city goes through with it. It is unclear if the trail on Cedar Scenic Road would be off the road or separated.

The preliminary assessment calculations are currently in the range of $8000-$12000 per estimated residential unit for single family residential properties except for Joler Road with a current estimated range of $15000-$18000 per estimated rental unit. Commercial properties are currently in the range of $180-220 per front foot.

All of these prices are estimated and nothing will be finalized until later in the year the city reported. One of the biggest factors affecting the rates are how high-density residential apartment complexes are factored in. Other factors affecting the rates are large parcel sizes.

In total the preliminary total cost of the project would be $3463918.08 for the road reclamation and $5152680.20 for the trail extensions.

Council member Zach Tabatt said he is torn between safety and cost on the trail portion of this project.

“I personally don’t feel safe on a lot of roads where your trail is on the road” Tabatt said.

Council member Mark Cross added that he “has a hard time not doing a separated trail despite it costing more.”

Council members also said they would like more information on the costs of the projects and how those costs would affect the residents. They mentioned the numbers would be nice to have so they could present it in front of the residents and “ask if they would like a trail for x amount of dollars.”

After hearing the opinions of the residents and more discussion the council will decide around December if they want to move forward with the improvements.

In other business Tuesday the council:

Approved SEH contract for railroad quiet zone design implementation and notification in the not to exceed amount of $81000.

Adopted a resolution for authorization of the federal aid funding agreement for the 2022 Highway 210/Inglewood Drive improvement project

Scheduled a public hearing for certification of delinquent utility bills invoices and abatements for 7 p.m. Nov. 15 or shortly thereafter.

Approved the purchase of two squad computer replacements in the amount of $7145.

Adopted a resolution setting the assessment for the 2022 Highway 210/Inglewood Drive railway crossing improvement project.

Olson also gave a mayoral proclamation stating the city of Baxter recognizes Indigenous Peoples Day on the second Monday of October.

Newly minted as chairman and CEO of $20 billion global medical technology company BD in 2020 Polen became leader of one of the most important health organizations in the world just as the pandemic struck. From Covid tests to the syringes used to inject vaccines into billions of arms BD—and Polen—found themselves at the epicenter of all-things-Covid while at the same time having to continue to provide every imaginable type of medical equipment used inside almost every doctor’s office and hospital in the western world. That IV tube in grandma’s arm? It’s likely made by Polen’s people.

It’s about as complex a CEO job as can be imagined leading 75000 employees—and millions of customers—though a time of chaotic high-stakes change but it was one he’d trained for. He started at BD in 1999  worked at Baxter Healthcare for a few years and then returned to BD in 2009 serving in a variety of leadership roles including president of several worldwide business units within BD’s Life Sciences segment and later as president of the BD Medical segment. In 2017 he led the strategy for the $24 billion acquisition of C. R. Bard Inc. and was named president and chief operating officer of BD before becoming CEO.

In a recent conversation with Chief Executive we asked Polen to dive deep into the details of how he does what he does everything from tackling inflation and strengthening supply chains to growing a “growth mindset” at every level of his organization while keeping everyone “hyper-aligned” on the big picture. He obliged. What follows has been edited for length and clarity.

Two years into the CEO job what have you learned about being a CEO?

People often actually will say “Wow Tom what a tough time to become a CEO” because within six weeks of becoming CEO the pandemic struck. I actually would say what a tremendous opportunity to make an impact in that window leading one of the world’s largest medical technology companies. I couldn’t be more proud of how BD’s responded in helping to support healthcare in those first six weeks when the pandemic struck. I remember we said “Well we need to help get the world vaccinated. We need to help get the world diagnosed and we need to help them get well.”

Over the last two years we’ve helped deliver over 2 billion vaccine doses around the world. We made 2 billion additional syringes just to deliver Covid vaccines. We developed one of the first two rapid tests in the world for Covid and made hundreds of millions of those tests. We now have over five molecular tests for Covid. We have three point-of-care rapid tests including an at-home test. And then we ramped up production where 90% of anyone going in a hospital to be treated for Covid is touched by our products helping to get people well.

So from fulfilling our purpose and kind of the idea of a crisis is a tremendous opportunity not to develop but to reveal one’s character which we said right from the beginning. We couldn’t be more proud of how we’ve responded.

What surprised you though? The CEO job is a different job—it can be surprising at how different it is than being the SVP or the something else of a division.

Probably the biggest thing I learned was just the importance of the voice of the CEO in setting the tone. Certainly a crisis really shows that. When the world’s uncertain the CEO role is a tremendous responsibility for communication.

For example on the Covid assays when we were developing those it normally takes us three years to develop a new rapid test—we did it in three months. We pulled the best and brightest from across the company and we said “We have to get this done in three months not three years because that’s what the world needs. It’s never been done before ever but we need to make that happen.”

Watching the energy and the enthusiasm and just unleashing the potential of the organization when they really felt that the company was backing them and was taking away any fear of failure any concern and allowing them to focus on being their best.

What are the big challenges you see in the business in the coming months and how are you attacking those challenges?

We’re not facing any challenge that the rest of the world isn’t facing. Primarily we said several years ago that there are two things that we didn’t see any company in the world escaping and that’s inflation and supply chain challenges. But at the same time we declared very much internally and externally that while no company was going to escape inflation and supply chain challenges we were going to be the best in our industry at navigating those and that’s what we’ve been doing. We very early on [created] an inflation taskforce and a supply chain taskforce for how we’ll navigate those.

Give us a tip about how you’ve organized to get through some of these issues. How have you handled it?

We’ve trained thousands of associates through formal training on [building a] growth mindset which is the fundamental principle at BD—that there’s nothing that we cannot accomplish but there are just things that we haven’t chosen to do yet. So BD associates strongly believe that there’s nothing we can’t do there’s just things we haven’t done yet. And that’s a very important premise to have when you face a challenge right? Before you go into a war room if you don’t have that fundamental belief you’re not gonna get to a good outcome because there’s going to be nonstop walls put up.

How do you go about developing that growth mindset? What’s in that program?

We partnered with a group the NeuroLeadership Institute in New York who have built the best group of science around how do you create growth mindsets in organizations and how does that unleash capabilities and power. We put people through training on a growth mindset—what it is what it looks like. We celebrate it and recognize it. I’m a big fan of certainly you get what you measure but even more so you get what you celebrate and that’s more fun and it’s more powerful.

We have metrics and we measure a lot of things but the power of celebration is even stronger in an organization in terms of driving culture. We’re constantly pointing out growth mindset: “Hey here’s something that happened in this business that we can all learn from” and then we share those stories nonstop. That’s who’s up on stage that’s who’s at town halls and we’re telling growth mindset stories constantly in the organization. People can see that people who do well this is what they do.

That’s how you drive culture and how you promote. We’re very very careful in every promotion announcement that we make. Why exactly is that leader being promoted? And pretty much every announcement involves some aspect of growth mindset and a story about that leader and how they displayed it and connecting that to people doing well in the organization. You have to holistically make it ingrained that this is what we talk about and who we are. Once people have a fundamental understanding of it and then see it in action it’s amazing how fast the flywheel moves.

How about navigating inflation and the supply chain challenges?

A few things or advice that I would give the CEO in terms of navigating supply chain and inflationary challenges first off is it’s not something that can be delegated. We are proud of having looked ahead and around the corner. Probably we got out ahead of others in recognizing that supply chain challenges not only were going to come but we believed that they were going to persist.

The same thing in inflation. We very early on took a position that this wasn’t just about to occur but that it wasn’t going to go away in a short period of time. That’s prudent as a healthcare provider. We have an obligation to make sure that we’re positioned to navigate those [challenges]. You can’t delegate that.

The level of change is not insignificant and which again requires the CEO. Someone once said to me “Remember Tom the last time there was inflation the majority of your organization was in high school” and this is very uncomfortable. This is the first time the majority of the organization have had to lead through this and so it’s going to feel entirely new. You can’t just communicate “here’s the direction” and then expect that folks would know a playbook. That’s not going to work. You really need to be leading from the front and recognizing that there’s cultural change that’s happening.

We’ve brought in for example professors of economics from University of Chicago to run training sessions and hold education events for our associates on what is inflation? What does it mean? And exactly what actions the companies need to take to thrive in that. When I first thought of the topic I thought “I wasn’t expecting that I would need to bring in professors to help.” But those types of things have been really important. Understanding the dynamics of why it’s important for example to understand cost of the inventory you’re putting in the warehouse versus what you’re selling because that’s really what matters or how inventory has to be managed even more tightly in an inflationary environment given the higher costs.

Is that taking down the number of SKUs that you’ve got? Instead of 19 different colors maybe you’re really only going to get by with 5 next year—that kind of thing?

You’re telling our BD 2025 strategy. It’s focused around growth and transforming the company around three forces that are reshaping healthcare but the second element of our strategy was always simplification. We had established a program called Project RECODE which really has three elements rooted in the fundamental belief that we believe complexity kills growth. Complexity does three things: It makes it difficult for customers to do business with the company it makes it difficult for associates to get work done and it diverts money away from more value-creating activities. Otherwise it’s fantastic.

So we wanna get rid of complexity in every corner. Project RECODE what it’s focused on doing is simplifying our manufacturing network including moving production closer to where the distribution of those products is. The second one is simplifying our portfolio. We have a very large portfolio we’re eliminating 30% of our portfolio rationalizing those.

We have over 50000 SKUs. We had 7000 different versions of IV sets or a Foley catheter. You don’t need that many. We’ve been very systematically rationalizing that which not only improves productivity in our plants it helps reduce stock-outs and improves supply for our customers. And ultimately it improves quality for our customers because the fewer SKUs we can ramp up automation which helps reduce quality risk in our industry which is imperative.

How do you do alignment? You’ve got an enormous organization you’re in so many different lines of business. How do you get everybody singing from the same song sheet? How do you interact with your direct reports and then how do you make sure that that’s cascading down?

I’d say there’s three layers or four layers that I have that drive hyper-alignment and we constantly use the term hyper-alignment. The first is I’m a very big fan of white papers. So when I came into the role we wrote a 20-page white paper on BD 2025 which reflects on the past and clearly articulates where we’re heading and the strategies we’re executing and why. And every year I update a new chapter reflecting on the prior year and our goals for the next year related to BD 2025 any changes that we have to make because of how the environment’s evolving.

But that’s very powerful for the CEO to take the time to do that sharing that with their leadership team getting their leadership team’s input and editing the white paper. That’s a way to get the leadership team hyper-aligned. I’ll call that the first level. That’s really really important that process of writing a separate white paper. Every year there’s a new white paper that is this year’s update to BD 2025. The true north isn’t changing but it’s reflecting “Hey inflation is persisting we’re gonna need to do this differently or the supply chain we’re gonna do this differently or we’ve now moved past this phase we’re now in the second phase of BD 2025.” So that’s one.

Next is we cascade those down into what we call KDGs our key driver goals and those go across the company. Again they’re all hyper-aligned under growth goals simplification goals and our empower goals which is the third element in BD 2025. Those are the metrics that we review every month in our operating committee. Those are cascaded through to every business.

At the same time our key driver goals are broad across the company. We call out 10 things in those key driver goals that we call our needle movers. On my weekly leadership team check-in calls we go through our key driver goals or our needle movers every single week. “Were are we standing?” Because we’re saying “These are the 10 things we have to get done this year and if we don’t we’re not going to be on track to deliver our transformation.”

This isn’t outcomes. This isn’t “where are we on profitability?” This is “what are the underlying behaviors and activities that are driving the profitability?”

Correct. Where are they standing exactly? Not just the metric. We’re not reviewing the metric and key driver goals it’s the progress and the activities. It all goes back to the white paper to the broad KDGs to the very targeted subset of those needle movers and then the operating mechanisms that are used across the organization. We have our monthly operating committee that drives those through every region. Every business has those specific goals that hyper-align into the key driver goals. If you go to any BD business or region everyone’s goals will align to grow simplify and empower everyone’s goals will align back to the key driver goals everyone will have a similar operating mechanism that ends up rolling up from a cadence.

The corporate operating committee is the third week of every month. It starts with an end of week one review at a certain level another group of the organization has week two to do that so by the time it hits where I’m reviewing it I don’t want to just hear numbers; I want people that have had time to work through and if there’s an issue where they’ve been able to start problem-solving and having a discussion. So we give people time before we’re reviewing the performance to be able to synthesize it and take action on it.

Everything we talk about from a town hall perspective it’s constantly tied back to grow simplify and empower. It’s not just an internal communication if you were to read our analyst decks or see any discussion with investors or our earnings calls. It’s all the exact same. There’s no differentiation. What we talk about internally is the same thing as what we talk about externally.

What’s the thought going into the year ahead that you’ve been giving to your leadership team about persevering in the face of all of this change?

Maybe two things. One is it is important when people are running it at the pace that we’re running to just step back and reflect. I think probably most organizations when they really step back there’s a lot of pride to be had in what organizations are doing through these times and actually how their organizations have responded and that’s something we’ve been spending more time doing. One thing I find is that leaders often aren’t doing enough of that in this environment.

For us for example we’ve been outperforming the broader S&P the MedTech index by quite a bit this year because of our ability to navigate a challenging environment to help support our customers and the growth that we’re driving through our innovation pipeline. You’ve got to take time to let folks know and step back and understand here’s where the company stands. Here are the outcomes of all the hard work that you’re doing. Celebrating. Again getting back to celebrating—making sure that with everything going on that you’re not letting that celebration slow down that it’s actually more important than ever to be celebrating and recognizing associates in this point in time.

The other big component of culture change that we’re driving is servant leadership. Measuring leaders on how successful their organizations are. The idea that we’ve communicated very clearly is that leaders are at the bottom of our pyramid associates are at the top. That’s more important than ever not just in a challenging environment but in a very tight labor market.

The last thing I’d say is we’re a very purpose-driven company. People join BD nothing against t-shirts and tennis shoes or other things but what we do saves lives. I often say inside of BD there’s a lot of really cool technology out there iPhones electric cars lots of really exciting things that people love and want. But as soon as someone or their loved one gets sick the only thing that almost anyone in the world wants is for them or their loved one to get well. And that’s all that matters and that’s what we do. And it’s that purpose that for our associates gets people to go through walls and challenging times.

At a Glance A comparison of four common drugs for treating type 2 diabetes showed that two outperformed the others in maintaining target blood sugar levels.

The findings offer new insights for the long-term management of type 2 diabetes.

Diabetes affects more than 37 million Americans. Up to about 95% of them have type 2 diabetes in which their body doesn’t make or use insulin well. This can impair the ability to keep levels of blood sugar (also called blood glucose) in a safe range. When blood glucose gets too high it can cause complications such as nerve kidney eye and heart-related conditions.

A drug called metformin has long been the considered the first-line medication for type 2 diabetes. Health care professionals generally recommend metformin combined with diet and exercise as the best early approach to diabetes care. If blood glucose becomes difficult to control over time a second medication is often added. But there had been no consensus regarding which medications might best be added to metformin to keep blood glucose levels in check. And it had been unclear which drugs might best protect against common side effects such as cardiovascular disease.

To find answers NIH supported a large clinical trial to directly compare four drugs often used in combination with metformin to treat type 2 diabetes. The trial was conducted at 36 study centers nationwide. Findings were described in a pair of papers that appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine on September 22 2022.

The trial enrolled more than 5000 people with type 2 diabetes who were already taking metformin. They were from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. Participants were randomly placed into one of four treatment groups. Three groups took metformin plus a medicine that increased insulin levels: sitagliptin liraglutide or glimepiride. The fourth group took metformin and insulin glargine U-100 a long-acting insulin.

After about five years of follow-up the researchers found that all four drugs improved blood glucose levels when added to metformin. But those taking metformin plus liraglutide or the long-acting insulin achieved and maintained their target blood levels for the longest time. They had about six months more time with blood glucose levels in the target range compared with those taking sitagliptin the least effective in maintaining target levels. The effects of treatment did not differ with age sex race or ethnicity.

However none of the combinations overwhelmingly outperformed the others. Although average blood sugar levels decreased during the study nearly three of four participants were unable to maintain the blood glucose target over the study period. This underscores the difficulty for many patients with type 2 diabetes to maintain recommended targets.

The study also looked at the drugs’ effects on developing diabetes-related cardiovascular disease and other conditions. Although the differences were small participants in the liraglutide group were least likely to experience any cardiovascular disease. However gastrointestinal symptoms were more common with liraglutide than with the other groups. Severe hypoglycemia or low blood glucose was generally uncommon but affected more participants assigned to glimepiride.

“This study was designed to provide health care providers with important information on how to guide the long-term management of type 2 diabetes” says the study’s project scientist Dr. Henry Burch of NIH’s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. “This is an integral step toward precision medicine for diabetes care as these results can now be used in the decision-making process for each individual patient in light of their levels of glucose control how well the medications are tolerated and the person’s other health considerations.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMixAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL3NleHVhbGx5LXRyYW5zbWl0dGVkLWRpc2Vhc2VzLXN0ZC10cmVhdG1lbnQtbWFya2V0LXRvLXJlY29yZC1hLWNhZ3Itb2YtNC0yNy1pbmNyZWFzaW5nLXByZXZhbGVuY2Utb2Ytc3Rkcy10by1ib29zdC1tYXJrZXQtZ3Jvd3RoLS0tdGVjaG5hdmlvLTMwMTY0MDYyMy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Treatment Market to Record a CAGR of 4.27% Increasing Prevalence Of STDs to ...,"NEW YORK Oct. 5 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The ""Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Treatment Market by Type (viral infections bacterial infections and other infections) and Geography (North America Europe Asia and Rest of World (ROW)) - Forecast and Analysis 2022-2026"" report has been added to Technavio's offering.

Greg Abel of Des Moines Warren Buffett's designated successor has bought almost $70 million in Berkshire Hathaway stock

Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said Abel's investment ""demonstrates his alignment with shareholders”

OMAHA Neb. — Billionaire Warren Buffett's successor bought nearly $70 million worth of stock in the conglomerate he is slated to one day lead.

Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Greg Abel a Des Moines resident on Monday disclosed buying 168 Class A shares in the company in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The purchases made last Thursday at prices between $405800 and $408514.01 per share will give Abel a small stake of 173 Class A shares in the Omaha Nebraska-based company's future.

Berkshire owns more than 90 companies including BNSF railroad Geico insurance several major utilities and an assortment of manufacturing and retail companies that includes Dairy Queen See's Candy Helzberg Diamonds and Precision Castparts. Besides the companies it owns outright Berkshire also has a sizeable investment portfolio with major stakes in iconic companies such as Apple Coca-Cola Bank of America and American Express.

His holdings pale in comparison to Buffett's. The legendary investor who has been Berkshire's chairman and CEO for decades holds 229016 A shares and 276 B shares to give him control of more than 30% of Berkshire’s voting stock. He has been gradually giving his shares away to five foundations with most of his donations going to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Abel described by Iowa friends as a ""regular guy"" who grew up in working-class neighborhood in Edmonton Alberta already oversees all of Berkshire's noninsurance businesses and Buffett has said that he will one day take over as CEO as part of the company's succession plan. But the 92-year-old Buffett says he has no plans to retire.

Investors will no doubt be encouraged to see Abel who's been with Berkshire Hathaway since 2000 buying some Berkshire shares. But this summer he sold back to the company for $870 million his stake in Berkshire's MidAmerican Energy the Des Moines-based utility division that he used to lead. Even after these recent purchases of Berkshire stock he has a significantly smaller investment in Berkshire that he used to.

Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said he's glad to see Abel investing in Berkshire shares because it “demonstrates his alignment with shareholders.” But he said it's a relatively small investment given Abel's wealth and compared to his previous stake.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2J1ZmZldHRzLXN1Y2Nlc3Nvci1idXlzLWJlcmtzaGlyZS1zaGFyZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett's Successor Buys Berkshire Shares,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/buffetts-successor-buys-berkshire-shares on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2J1ZmZldHRzLXN1Y2Nlc3Nvci1idXlzLWJlcmtzaGlyZS1zaGFyZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL21hcmtldHMuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3N0b2Nrcy93YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1ncmVnLWFiZWwtYmVya3NoaXJlLWhhdGhhd2F5LWVuZXJneS1zdG9jay1wcmljZS1zdWNjZXNzaW9uLTIwMjItMTDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Buffett's Successor Buys $68 Million of Berkshire Stock in One Day,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL21hcmtldHMuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3N0b2Nrcy93YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1ncmVnLWFiZWwtYmVya3NoaXJlLWhhdGhhd2F5LWVuZXJneS1zdG9jay1wcmljZS1zdWNjZXNzaW9uLTIwMjItMTDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018ECA0AF310>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL21hcmtldHMuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3N0b2Nrcy93YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1ncmVnLWFiZWwtYmVya3NoaXJlLWhhdGhhd2F5LWVuZXJneS1zdG9jay1wcmljZS1zdWNjZXNzaW9uLTIwMjItMTDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTEwLTAzL2J1ZmZldHQtcy1zdWNjZXNzb3ItYWJlbC1idWlsZHMtNjgtbWlsbGlvbi1iZXJrc2hpcmUtaG9sZGluZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett’s Successor Greg Abel Builds $68 Million Berkshire Holding,"Why did this happen?

But these dates don't actually indicate product safety. In fact manufacturers have used labels ""best by"" or ""sell by"" to estimate when their products have reached peak quality. This confusion over labeling leads to consumers prematurely throwing away perfectly safe and nutritious food.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that 30% of the food supply goes to waste annually and a big part of that is due to misunderstanding labels.

There are no federal rules governing the food labels except for infant formula which is required to have a ""use by"" date in the U.S. That means manufacturers are allowed to determine when their products will taste best.

Get Philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia newsletters.

The FDA has recommended that manufacturers use the labels “best if used by” for freshness and “use by” for perishable goods based on surveys showing that consumers understand those phrases. However the recommendation isn't mandatory and consumers continue seeing variations in some cases because of local regulations.

“Most people believe that if it says ‘sell by' ‘best by' or ‘expiration' you can’t eat any of them. That's not actually accurate"" said Richard Lipsit who owns a Grocery Outlet store in Pleasanton California that specializes in discounted food.

Here's what each food label means and how to determine whether to toss that product or keep it :

""Best by"" Dates

Labels with phrases like “Best if Used by” ""Enjoy by"" and ""Fresh through"" indicates when a product will be have the best flavor or quality. It is not an expiration date. The product can still be consumed after this date but it may no longer meet the company's standard for freshness.

It’s difficult for manufacturers to pinpoint exactly how long foods will stay good given variables like how long they sit on loading docks and how they’re stored in people’s homes.

Regardless the USDA says most shelf-stable foods are safe indefinitely. In fact canned goods can last for years as long as the can itself is in good condition (no rust dents or swelling). Packaged foods like cereal pasta and cookies will also be safe past the ""best by"" date although they may eventually become stale or develop an off flavor.

If the products have changed noticeably in color consistency or texture consumers may want to avoid eating them.

""Sell by"" Dates

The “Sell by” date tells the store how long to display the product for sale and is useful for inventory management. Much like the ""best by"" date it is not related to food safety and does not mean the food is spoiled.

Many food items can continue to be used or stored for a short amount of time past the purchase date.

Milk is generally good for at least five to seven days after its “Sell by” date though exactly how long will depend on factors including proper storage in the refrigerator and pasteurization methods.

Another example is ground meat and poultry which should be cooked or frozen one to two days past the purchase date. Eggs can stay good for up to three to five weeks past the ""sell by"" date if stored properly in a refrigerator. It is recommended to refrigerate eggs in their original carton and place them in the coldest part of the refrigerator not in the door due to loss of coolness from repeated opening of the door.

However if you are concerned about spoilage the best test is with your nose. If the food product smells bad it probably is bad.

""Use by"" Dates

A “Use by” date is the last date recommended by the manufacture to use a product before peak quality starts to decline. Much like the ""best by"" date it doesn't indicate food safety except for when used on important product: infant formula.

Baby formula consumed by this date ensures the formula contains nothing less than the quantity of each nutrient described on the label.

""Freeze by"" Dates

A “Freeze by” date indicates when a product should be frozen to maintain peak quality. It is not a purchase or safety date.

Storage times for frozen meat can vary from one month to up to a year depending on the type -- chicken pork or beef -- from a quality perspective. But because freezing stops the clock on spoilage and prevents the growth of food poisoning bacteria it is safe to eat no matter how long a food is frozen for.

Foods that have been in the freezer for months may be dry or may not taste as good but they will be safe to eat. So if you find a package of ground beef that has been in the freezer more than a few months don’t throw it out. Use it to make chili or tacos. The seasonings and additional ingredients can make up for loss of flavor.

How to Know When Food Has Spoiled

Food safety experts generally recommend throwing out food at the first signs of spoilage. With mold even a small fleck might be an indicator that there’s a lot more of it that you can’t see.

Spoiled foods will typically develop an off odor flavor or texture due to growing bacteria. If a food has developed a bad smell or funky flavor or texture it should not be eaten.

An exception is for certain dense foods where mold has difficulty spreading. With hard cheeses for instance food safety experts say it’s fine to carve out a 1-inch chunk around the mold and eat the rest. If you’re not sure about when it’s safe to eat around mold the U.S. Department of Agriculture offers a chart here.

Additionally the USDA notes that not all spoilage is visible or smellable. A slab of raw chicken for example might look fresh but contain salmonella. To limit the chances of getting sick from such germs regulators recommend safe cooking and handling practices.

Should you rinse raw poultry? Advice over the years has been conflicting. Even cooking legends Julia Child and Jacques Pepin disagreed but a new study from the Department of Agriculture has a definitive answer: Don't do it! ""The sink could be a source of cross contamination"" warns the USDA's Dr. Mindy Brashears.

Most canned foods can be stored for two to five years and high-acid foods like canned juices tomatoes and pickles can be stored for up to 18 months according to the USDA. However cans with dents bulges or rust are a sign it is time to toss those products.

What exactly causes food spoilage? Tiny microorganisms such as molds yeasts and bacteria can multiply — especially when food is not stored or handled properly.

There are two types of bacteria: pathogenic which causes food borne illness and spoilage bacteria which does not cause illness but makes food deteriorate and develop unpleasant characteristics such as an unappetizing taste or odor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qYXlza2kuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMDUvcnlhbi12YXJnYXMtYW5kLWpkLW1vdG9yc3BvcnRzLXdlbGNvbWUtc3dhbm4tc2VjdXJpdHktd2l0aC1iZXN0LWJ1eS1iYWNrLW9uLWJvYXJkLWF0LWxhcy12ZWdhcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ryan Vargas and JD Motorsports Welcome Swann Security with Best Buy Back On Board at Las Vegas,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.jayski.com/2022/10/05/ryan-vargas-and-jd-motorsports-welcome-swann-security-with-best-buy-back-on-board-at-las-vegas/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qYXlza2kuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMDUvcnlhbi12YXJnYXMtYW5kLWpkLW1vdG9yc3BvcnRzLXdlbGNvbWUtc3dhbm4tc2VjdXJpdHktd2l0aC1iZXN0LWJ1eS1iYWNrLW9uLWJvYXJkLWF0LWxhcy12ZWdhcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzY2hhbm5lbDUuY29tL25ld3MvbmV3c2NoYW5uZWwtNS1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0ZXMvbXktbW9tLWZlbGwtdmljdGltLXRvLXNjYW1tZXJzLWFuZC1pcy1zaGFyaW5nLWhlci1zdG9yeS1zby15b3UtY2FuLXByb3RlY3QteW91cnNlbGbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,My mom fell victim to scammers and is sharing her story so you can protect yourself,"BRENTWOOD Tenn. (WTVF) — If you got a call or an email from a scammer would you realize it in time? Before they got your money or personal information?

You'd like to think so. But do you know the warning signs and red flags to look for?

Scammers are coming up with new ways to steal your money all of the time. But many of them use a lot of the same tricks.

Bryan Staples/NewsChannel 5 Nashville

The latest scam going around is the Best Buy or Geek Squad scam. And we found someone who recently fell victim who never thought it would happen to her. Now she realizes it can happen to anyone. And she's sharing her experience so hopefully the same thing doesn't happen to you.

Eighty-one-year-old Barbara Kraus who also happens to be my mom recently got what appeared to be a bill from Best Buy's Geek Squad for three years of antivirus protection for her computers. She's a longtime Geek Squad customer so she didn't question it.

Bryan Staples/NewsChannel 5 Nashville

My mom though did not want three years of anti-virus protection. She likes to pay for one year at a time. So she called the number on the bill.

And that's how they got her.

Scammers are sending out these fake invoices through the mail and email. In fact my dad got one too. My mom didn't notice though what should have been a red flag: the unusual way ""Geék Sqüad"" is written on the invoice.

Soon after she began talking with the woman who answered the phone the woman told my mom that somehow $4000 from her bank account had wound up going to Best Buy and they wanted to get it back to her. And all they needed you guessed it was her bank account information.

""That’s the stupid part is that I didn’t go 'Wait a minute? How would that be the case? It can’t be the case'"" Kraus said.

By this time a man had taken over the conversation and he kept my mom on the line chatting while the woman bank statements show was trying to withdraw money from my mom's account.

""So this person is trying to clear out your bank account?"" I asked my mom.

""I would say yes"" she replied.

""What do you think about that?"" we wondered.

She gave out a big laugh then asked ""What do I think?""

Her reply ""Scandalous!""

Next the scammer told my mom she needed to go to the store to buy gift cards.

""Four of them $500 each"" Kraus explained.

First he sent her to CVS where the clerk may have been suspicious and would only sell her two.

The scammer then had my mom scratch off and read the numbers on the back to him which essentially gave him access to all of that money. But he wanted more.

""He said 'I think what we’ll do can you go to Target?' And I said 'Yeah I can'"" my mom recalled.

By the time she got to Target she'd been on the phone with this team of scammers for more than two and a half hours. And that's when it finally hit her.

""All of a sudden I thought 'Wait a minute. This is absolutely absurd'"" Kraus said.

Best Buy told NewsChannel 5 Investigates ""We have a security team constantly working to prevent consumers from falling victim to scams that are using the Best Buy or Geek Squad brand. That includes working directly with federal law enforcement and other retailers.""

Detective Sergeant Lori Russ with the Brentwood Police Department told NewsChannel 5 Investigates her department gets at least one or two reports of residents being scammed a week.

She advised ""Never give your Social Security number and never give your banking information over the phone.""

Russ explained that scammers are always coming up with new ways to steal your money but still popular is the old grandparent scam where the caller claims to be a grandchild who needs help. Also still popular: scams where the caller insists you've failed to show up for jury duty or owe money to the IRS.

Russ said that to protect yourself you should educate yourself and know that scammers will often insist on secrecy and tell you not to tell anyone what you're doing.

They'll do everything they can to keep you on the phone. And they can be really persistent.

Bryan Staples/NewsChannel 5 Nashville

""[They're] getting you to go to the bank or go to Target to buy those gift cards and even if they’re super nice and trying to be helpful and saying 'I just want to help you out in the situation' most of the time if they’re really persistent and pushy absolutely that should be a red flag"" Russ said.

""I mean really I should have caught it near the beginning"" Kraus now realizes.

She lost $1000 to this scam but hopes that by talking about it others can learn from her mistakes.

""Be aware that it can happen to anybody even though you think 'I wouldn’t be scammed no way'"" she cautioned.

Just remember: if someone is trying to pressure you to turn over personal information or send them money stop for a second and ask yourself ""does this make sense?"" And when in doubt just hang up.

We did try calling the number on the bill that my mom had called. It's already been disconnected. But you can bet the scammers have already found a new number to use.

Fraud Prevention Tips

Limit sharing your personal information. Be thoughtful when you get an email or phone request for your personal information like a bank account or credit card number.



If you’re pressured to act quickly odds are it’s a scam.



Don’t open email attachments or click on links unless you’re certain they’re from legitimate sources. If you’re uncertain you can always call 1-888-BESTBUY to confirm.



Beware of emails and texts that have you ""verify"" personal information online. Most legitimate companies will never request personal information in this manner including Best Buy.



If you receive a call or email asking for payment by gift card know that it’s a scam. Report it to your local authorities and the Federal Trade Commission right away.



Never provide your gift card number and pin to anyone you don’t know. Once those numbers are gone so is your money.

Best Buy’s Fraud Prevention

We have a security team constantly working to prevent consumers from falling victim to scams that are using the Best Buy or Geek Squad brand. That includes working directly with federal law enforcement and other retailers.



We have signs on the gift card displays to warn customers of potential fraud. Our employees receive training on warning signs for customers who may be victims of a scam.

We’ve also reduced gift card purchase limits and no longer allow our gift cards to be used to purchase third-party gift cards. We’ve substantially reduced the maximum value of gift cards to make them less attractive to thieves. Limits are now $500 per card at a total daily limit of $2000 per person; it was previously a single card maximum of $2000 and total daily limit of $6000.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlnbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvZGVhbC1hbGVydC1zYXZlLTYwLW9mZi1uYW5vbGVhZi1tb2R1bGFyLXJnYi1saWdodGluZy1wYW5lbHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deal Alert: Save 60% Off Nanoleaf Modular RGB Lighting Panels,"Ready to decorate your house in RGB bling for the holidays?

Nanoleaf Shapes Mini Triangles Smarter RGB Lighting Panel Kit (5-Pack) 0 $119.99 save 58% $49.99 at Best Buy

Nanoleaf Shapes are dimmable RGB LED light panels that measure 4.5"" on each side and are capable of displaying over 16 million colors. They're modular meaning they can link together to create a larger illuminated art piece on your wall. The interlocking nature allows you to create your own design limited only to just how many panels you have on hand. All linked panels also feed power to one another (up to 30 panels) so you only have to find a way to hide a single power cable.

The ""Smarter"" kit includes the controller that allows you to connect to your light panels over WiFI. The lighting effects are synched across all the panels and you can create an awesome customized light show once they're connected to an app on your Android or iOS smartphone or tablet. The panels essentially become one large canvas and the lights can blend and shift across multiple panels. It's all very pretty. The lights are both touch and sound sensitive and can be set to dance to your music or react to hand gestures. The more kits you buy the more impressively grand your masterpiece.

There are expansion packs that generally run you about $120 for a 10 pack. These don't include the controller so you'll need to get a starter kit first and then you can add expansion packs on top of it. With this deal it's actually cheaper buying multiple starter kits instead of buying the expansion packs. Although these are mini triangles they are also compatible with the hexagon and full-sized triangle panels as well.

The best thing about these kits is that they don't go out of style like Christmas lights. You never have to take them down and it will feel like the holidays 24/7.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL2RlYWxzL2luc2lnbmlhLTUtcXVhcnQtZGlnaXRhbC1haXItZnJ5ZXItYmVzdC1idXktMzAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,For $30 This Large 5-Quart Air Fryer Is Yours,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL2RlYWxzL2luc2lnbmlhLTUtcXVhcnQtZGlnaXRhbC1haXItZnJ5ZXItYmVzdC1idXktMzAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018ECA185C60>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL2RlYWxzL2luc2lnbmlhLTUtcXVhcnQtZGlnaXRhbC1haXItZnJ5ZXItYmVzdC1idXktMzAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Animal experiments were performed in compliance with the national ethical guidelines set by the European Union and were approved by the National Animal Experiment Board (Project Authorisation Board). The ethical practice of handling laboratory animals was strictly followed throughout the procedures. The mice were housed at 22 °C with 12 h light/dark cycles with ad libitum access to standard rodent food and water.

Knockout mouse generation

Embryonic stem cells (ES) with KO first allele targeted for Grpel1 were obtained from European Mouse Mutant Cell Repository (EuMMCR). ES cells were expanded and then injected into the blastocyst of C57BL/6NCrl mice in Biocenter Oulu Transgenic Core Facility. The chimeras were genotyped and bred to generate the Grpel1 heterozygotes (Grpel1+/-) which were then intercrossed in attempt to generate the whole-body homozygous knockout of Grpel1 (Grpel1−/−). To remove the Neo cassette Grpel1+/- mice were crossed with transgenic mice expressing Flp recombinase. The mice without Neo cassette were then bred with HSA-Cre-ERT2 mice which express tamoxifen-inducible Cre-ERT2 recombinase under the control of Human skeletal muscle α-actin gene (HSA)30. Tamoxifen (Sigma: T5648) was dissolved in corn oil (Sigma: C8267) (20 mg/ml) by gently shaking at 37 °C overnight and stored at −20 °C. For injection 5-week-old mice were given 100 µl of tamoxifen for 5 consecutive days with a 22 g syringe intraperitoneally (IP). The mice were then kept in quarantine for 3 days. After quarantine the mice were transferred to new cages and monitored. Body weights were recorded before and after the treatment every week.

Whole-body metabolism and body composition

Oxymax Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS; Columbus Instruments) was used to measure the oxygen consumption carbon dioxide production and spontaneous activity of the mice. The mice were kept in individual cages that were regulated for temperature ( + 22 °C) and parameters were recorded for 24 h following an overnight adaptation before recordings. The body composition i.e. fat and lean mass of the mice was estimated with Bruker minispec LF50 Body Composition Analyzer.

Grip strength

Muscle strength was determined with a grip strength meter. The mouse was placed over the grid gently pulled by its tail and allowed to grasp the mesh grid by its fore and hind limbs. Six consecutive measurements were performed with a minute interval for each mouse. The mean maximal grip strength was recorded and then normalized to the body weight of individual mouse.

Glucose and insulin tolerance tests

A 6 h fasting period was set for the glucose tolerance test by removing food from the cages. The basal blood glucose was measured by tail vein puncture and then the mice were given glucose (1 g/kg of body weight) by IP injection. The blood glucose levels were measured at 15 30 60 90 and 120 min with a glucometer (Accu-Chek Aviva Glucose Meter Roche). For the insulin sensitivity test basal blood glucose level was measured by puncturing the tail vein. Then the mice were given intraperitoneal insulin injection (0.8 U/kg of body weight) (Novolin R Novo Nordisk) and the blood glucose was measured at 15 30 60 90 and 120 min after the injection.

Histology

After the tissue samples were collected they were fixed in 10% buffered formalin for one to three days at 4 °C. Tissues were then processed and paraffinized using Sakura Tissue-Tek VIP processor and next day embedded in paraffin blocks. For Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) staining1431 the tissue blocks were sectioned and stained with Hematoxylin for 1 min and with Eosin for 2 min with washes in between the stains. Dehydration was done with absolute EtOH cleared with xylene. The sections were then mounted with Pertex mounting medium (Histolab 00811). For the analysis of collagenization in skeletal muscle paraffin samples were stained with Picrosirius Red staining. Samples were first de-paraffinized with xylene and rehydrated using descending EtOH series. After rehydration samples were stained with Weigert´s haematoxylin for 8 min to stain nuclei and then stained with 0.1% Sirius Red (Sigma 365548) in 1.3% picric acid for one hour. Samples were then washed twice with acidified water (5 ml acetic acid in one liter of distilled water) dehydrated with ascending EtOH series cleared with xylene and mounted with Pertex mounting medium (Histolab 00811). For the stainings of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activities1431 the tissues were freshly embedded in small amount of OCT medium (Tissue-Tek) and frozen in 2-methylbutane bath in liquid nitrogen. After freezing tissues were embedded with bigger amount of OCT and kept in −20 °C. The sectioning was done using Leica CM3050S cryostat. The muscle sections were incubated for 30 min in COX and 40 min in SDH straight on the object glass and washed in between. Dehydration was done with ascending EtOH series cleared with xylene and then mounted with Pertex mounting medium (Histolab 00811). All the stained sections were imaged by Axioplan 2 Universal Microscope (Zeiss).

Immunohistochemistry

Immunohistochemistry was done both from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded samples and frozen samples. Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded samples were first deparaffinized and rehydrated using xylene and descending EtOH series. Antigen retrieval was done by heating the samples 15 min in pressure cooker at 95 °C in 10 mM EDTA or 0.1 M citrate buffer pH 6. Frozen samples were first dried 20 min at room temperature and rinsed with 0.1% PBS-Triton-X. After this all steps were the same for both sample types. Nonspecific staining was blocked by incubating samples in blocking buffer (1.5% Normal goat serum + 5% fetal bovine serum in 0.1% PBS-Triton X-100) for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibodies were diluted in Dako antibody diluent (Agilent S3022) and incubated overnight at + 4 °C. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-GRPEL1 (NBP1-54665 Novus Biologicals) mouse anti-SDHA (ab14715 Abcam) rabbit anti-CHCHD10 (HPA003440 Sigma). Next day samples were washed three times with 0.1% PBS-Triton X-100 and secondary antibodies were diluted in Dako antibody diluent and incubated 30 min at RT. The samples were then washed 3x with 0.1% PBS-Triton X-100 and mounted with Vectashield mounting media with DAPI (Vector laboratories H-1200). Images were taken with Leica DM5000B wide field microscope.

Mitochondrial DNA copy number analysis

Total DNA was extracted from snap frozen QF muscle of control and Grpel1skm−/− mice by phenol-chloroform extraction method and quantified using Spectrophotometer (DeNovix DS-11 Series). 30 ng of isolated DNA was used as template. The mitochondrial DNA was quantified by amplifying the mitochondrial 12 S rRNA gene and normalized to nuclear RBM15 gene. Primers used were: 12S_Forward: AGGAGCCTGTTCTATAATCGATAAA 12 S_Reverse: GATGGCGGTATATAGGCCGAA RBM15_Forward: GGACAGTTTTCTT GGGCAAC and RBM15_Reverse: AGTTTGGCCCTGTGAGACAT.

High-resolution respirometry

Total tissue lysates were used in Oroboros for respiration measurement. Tissue lysates in MiR05 (0.5 mM EGTA 3 mM MgCl 2  60 mM K-lactobionate 10 mM KH 2 PO 4  20 mM HEPES and 110 mM sucrose pH 7.1) were taken to the chamber. We measured the response in oxygen flux for CI-coupled respiration after adding malate (final concentration 2 mM) pyruvate (10 mM) glutamate (20 mM) ADP (5 mM) and cytochrome C subsequently into the chamber. The CI + CII coupled respiration was measured with the addition of succinate (10 mM). Subsequent addition of carbonylcyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)-phenylhydrazone (FCCP) (2 mM) provided maximal respiration (CI + CII uncoupled respiration) of mitochondria. Basal respiration was measured by inhibiting the reaction with rotenone (0.1 μM) and antimycin (2.5 μM). Total protein concentration of tissue lysate was used for normalization.

Respiratory chain enzyme activity measurements

Isolated mitochondria were used for measuring RC complex activity. We isolated the mitochondria from skeletal muscle and followed the protocol of Spinazzi et al. 201232 for the measurement of enzymatic activity of CI-CIII. Complex IV activity was measured using Oroboros from flux response to ascorbate (10 μM) and TMPD (2.5 μM) after inhibiting CIII with antimycin A. The complete reaction was compromised by adding Azide (50 μM) to the chamber. We normalized the enzyme activities to total protein concentrations.

Immunoblotting

The tissue samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in −80 °C. About 20 mg of snap frozen tissues were taken and homogenized in RIPA buffer (Cell signaling technology) containing Halt™ Protease-inhibitor Cocktail (ThermoFisher) with Fast Prep w-24 Lysing Matrix D (MP Biomedical) and Precellys w-24 (Bertin Technologies). Protein concentrations were quantified with Bradford method (Bio-Rad). 20 μg of protein per sample were loaded into 10% stain free polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to nitocellulose membranes using transfer-blot turbo transfer system (Bio-Rad). The membranes were then blocked with 5% milk in 1X TBS-T to avoid nonspecific binding. The primary antibodies were prepared in 1% BSA/TBS-T with the concentrations recommended by the manufacturers. After subsequent washing membranes were incubated with following primary antibodies overnight at + 4 °C: rabbit anti-GRPEL1 (NBP1-54665 Novus Biologicals) goat anti-HSP60 (sc-1052 Santa Cruz Biotechnology) rabbit anti-GAPDH (14C10 Cell Signaling) rabbit anti-CHCHD10 (HPA003440 Sigma) rabbit anti-EIF2α (ab26197 Abcam) rabbit anti-p-EIF2α (phospho S51) (ab32157 Abcam) rabbit anti-S6 ribosomal protein (2217 Cell signaling) rabbit anti-phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (Ser 240/244) (5364 Cell signaling) rabbit anti-LC3B (NB600-1384 Novus Biologicals) mouse anti-vinculin (V9264 Sigma) and mouse anti-p62 (2C11 Abnova). Membranes were washed and then incubated with respective HRP conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h in room temperature. The Clarity Western ECL Substrate (BioRad) was used to develop protein band signals detected by Chemidoc XRS + Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). Quantification was done with the ImageLab software (Bio-Rad).

Mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation measurement

The QF muscle samples (100 mg) were homogenized in STE buffer (0.25 M sucrose 10 mM Tris 1 mM EDTA) and mitochondria were isolated. The isolated mitochondrial fraction was incubated in a reaction buffer (14C-radiolabeled oleic acid (NEC317250UC- Perkin Elmer) 2 mM ATP and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol) for 40 min at 37 °C. The CO 2 released from fatty acid oxidation were trapped in 1 M NaOH-soaked filter paper and measured for acid-soluble metabolites using a scintillation counter.

Transmission electron microscopy

The tissue samples were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 2 h and stored in 2% PFA at 4 °C. Tissue samples were embedded into blocks cut into thin sections and stained according to the standard procedure of the Electron Microscopy Unit of the Institute of Biotechnology University of Helsinki. JEOL JEM-1400 Plus transmission electron microscope was used for imaging and ImageJ software for quantifications.

RNA isolation and sequencing

Total RNA was isolated from snap frozen QF with miRNAeasy RNA extraction kit (Qiagen). The tissue samples were homogenized using Fast Prep w-24 Lysing Matrix D (MP Biomedical) and Precellys w-24 (Bertin Technologies). The NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina was used to generate sequencing libraries. From 1 µg of total RNAs the polyadenylated mRNAs were captured with NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module. The captured mRNAs were fragmented and then primed with random primers to generate the cDNA. The Agencourt AMPure XP beads were used to purify the double stranded cDNA. The end-prep reaction was performed using the end-prep reaction buffer and enzyme mix. The final PCR enrichment was carried after the adaptor ligated DNA went through a bead-based size selection. The amplified library was then purified using AMPure XP Beads and its quality was assessed by TapeStation (Agilent High Sensitivity D5000 assay) and library quantity by Qubit. The prepared libraries were then sequenced with Illumina NextSeq500-system (Mid Output 2 × 75 bp).

Raw data (bcl-files) was demultiplexed with bcl2fastq2 (v2.20.0.422; Illumina) removing adapter sequences and excluding reading reads that were too short (< 35 bp). Additional trimming for remaining adapter sequences ambiguous (N) and low-quality bases (Phred score < 25) was done using cutadapt33. We also excluded read pairs that were too short (< 25 bp) after trimming. The filtered read pairs were mapped to the mouse reference genome (GRCm38) with STAR (v. 2.5.4b)34. Gene expression was analysed with R (v.4.1.1)35. Read pairs mapping to exons were used to extract gene expression counts using Rsubreads (v.2.6.4)36. Duplicates chimeric and multimapping reads were excluded as well as reads with low mapping score (MAPQ < 10). The read count data was analyzed with DESeq2 (v.1.32.0)37 comparing knockout to wild type. Genes with low read depth (< 50 reads in total) were excluded.

The volcano plots were generated with ggplot2 (v.3.3.5)38 using the fold change and p values obtained from DESeq2. PCA was calculated with prcomp using log1p-transformed normalized counts. The differentially expressed genes (FDR < 0.01) were analyzed for enrichment separately for the up- and down-regulated genes using clusterProfiler39 against the Reactome pathways40 KEGG41 Gene ontology42 and WikiPathways43.

Actinonin treatment

Human skin fibroblasts obtained from two healthy volunteers were used for the experiments (C1 and C2). Briefly cells were cultured at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere normoxia and 5% CO 2 . Fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM media (Lonza #12-614 F) supplemented with 2mM L-glutamate (Life Technologies #250300081) 10% FBS (Life Technologies #10270106) 1x penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies #15140122) and 50 µg/ml uridine (Sigma #U3003). Once confluent fibroblasts were treated with 150 μM actinonin (Sigma A6671) for 24 h and samples were collected at 0 h 1.5 h 3 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h. Ethanol was used as vehicle for actinonin. After treatment fibroblasts were manually collected by scraping on ice and samples were stored at −80 °C until further processing. Total RNA from fibroblast cultures was isolated using NucleoSpin RNA extraction kit (Macherey-Nagel). RNA was reverse transcribed with Maxima first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher). cDNA levels were analyzed by qRT-PCR amplification. Primers used were: ACOX2 forward - AACCCAGGGGATCGAGTGT ACOX2 reverse – CGCAGCTCAGTGTTTGGGAT β-actin forward – ATGCTCCCCGGGCTGTAT β-actin reverse – CATAGGAGTCCTTCTGACC CATTC ATF4 forward AGTGGCATCTGTATGAGCCCA ATF4 reverse – GCTCCTATT TGGAGAGCCCCT and ATF5 forward – CTGGCTCCCTATGAGGTCCTTG ATF5 reverse – GAGCTGTGAAATCAACTCGCTCAG.

siRNA mediated knockdown

The siRNAs used for the knockdown of ATF4 ATF5 and non-targeting (NC) were synthesized by DharmaconTM (Cambridge UK). Initially the targeting efficiencies of siRNAs were tested at different concentrations and 20 nM concentration of each siRNA was chosen for actinonin treatment experiment. The inhibition efficiencies were detected by RT-qPCR. The siRNAs were transfected in human control fibroblasts (60−70% confluent) to a final concentration of 20 nM using Polyplus jetPRIME® transfection reagent (NY USA). After 24 h of transfection the cells were treated with actinonin (150 μM) for 24 h. The cells were then collected for RNA extraction and the expression levels of ATF4 ATF5 and ACOX2 were quantified by RT-qPCR.

Metabolite profiling

Mice were terminally anaesthetized with Pentobarbital (100 mg/kg) and blood was collected by heart puncture. The blood collection tubes were kept in ice for 15 min with serum separator and clot activator (MiniCollect Tube Breiner-bion-one 450533). The tubes were centrifuged at 5000RPM for 10 min and serum was transferred to a new tube and was kept at −80 °C until use. QF samples were collected from the same set of anaesthetized mice and snap frozen and kept at −80 °C until use. The metabolites were extracted from 20 mg mouse skeletal muscle (QF) tissue using 2 ml Precellys homogenization tube (Bertin Technologies) with 2.8 mm ceramic (zirconium oxide) beads with 400 µl of cold extraction solvent (Acetonitrile:Methanol:H 2 O; 40:40:20). Subsequently the samples were homogenized using tissue homogenizer (Bertin Technologies) for 3 cycles (30 sec at 5500 rpm with 60 sec pause at 4 °C). Furthermore the homogenized samples were centrifuged at 14000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min. For mouse serum metabolites were extracted from 50 ul serum with 400 µL of cold extraction solvent (ACN:MeOH:H2O). After centrifugation the supernatant was loaded into Phree Phospholipid removal 96-well plate (8E-S133-TGB Phenomenex) and passed through using robotic vacuum. The samples were analyzed with Thermo Vanquish UHPLC coupled with Q-Exactive Orbitrap quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a heated electrospray ionization (H-ESI) source probe (Thermo Fischer Scientific). A SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC (2.1 × 100 mm 5 μm particle) column (Merck) was used for chromatographic separation. Gradient elution was carried out with a flow rate of 0.100 ml/min with using 20 mM ammonium hydrogen carbonate adjusted to pH 9.4 with ammonium solution (25%) as mobile phase A and acetonitrile as mobile phase B. The gradient elution was initiated from 20% Mobile phase A and 80% of mobile phase B and maintained for 2 min. after that 20% Mobile phase A was gradually increased up to 80% for 17 min. Then Mobile phase A was decreased from 80% to 20% in 17.1 min and maintained up to 24 min. The column oven and auto-sampler temperatures were set to 40 ± 3 °C and 5 ± 3 °C respectively. MS was equipped with a heated electrospray ionization (H-ESI) source using polarity switching and the following settings: resolution of 35000 the spray voltages: 4250 V for positive and 3250 V for negative mode the sheath gas: 25 arbitrary units (AU) and the auxiliary gas: 15 AU sweep gas flow 0 Capillary temperature: 275 °C S-lens RF level: 50.0. Instrument control was operated with the Xcalibur 4.1.31.9 software (Thermo Fischer Scientific).

In the data processing the final peak integration was done with the TraceFinder 4.1 software (Thermo Fischer Scientific) using confirmed retention times of 462 in-house metabolites library developed using library kit MSMLS-1EA (Merck). For further data analysis the peak area data was exported as excel file. The data quality was monitored throughout the run using pooled sample as Quality Control (QC) prepared by pooling 5 µL from each suspended samples and interspersed throughout the run as every 10th sample. After integration of QC serum data with TraceFinfer 4 the detected metabolites were checked for peak % RSD were calculated and acceptance limit was set to ≤ 30%. Blank samples for carryover were injected after every fifth randomized samples to monitor the metabolites carryover effect and calculated against the mean QC area and acceptance limit was set ≤ 20% for each metabolite. Background % noise was calculated with respect to first blank against the mean QC area and acceptance limit was set ≤ 20% for each metabolite.

Metabolite data analysis

The data was analysed with Metaboanalyst 5.0 and the missing variables were imputated using KNNVAR. The values were normalised to the tissue weight Log10 transformed and auto scaled. Following statistical analysis were performed: Univariate analysis methods: t-tests (FDR-adjusted p-value threshold 0.05 volcano plot (FC > 2 t-tests p-value < 0.05); Multivariate analysis methods: principal component analysis (PCA) and clustering analysis: heatmap (distance measure using euclidean and clustering algorithm using ward.D). The differential expression was analyzed with lmFit using contrasts to compare knockout to wild type within each sample type. The differentially expressed metabolites (FDR < 0.01) were visualized with a volcano plot generated with ggplot2 (v.3.3.5). PCA was calculated with prcomp using the voom-normalized expression values. The enrichment analyses were performed for significantly altered metabolites (P < 0.05) using Metaboanalyst 5.0 (https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/) against KEGG database. To visualize pathway changes bubble maps of enriched metabolites (significantly different P < 0.05) with mean log 2 fold change (FC) were generated. Individual pathways or metabolites are plotted with mean log 2 FC and standard deviation.

Statistics and reproducibility

The data are presented as mean ± SD unless stated otherwise. The statistical analyses were performed with student’s t-test and one-way or two-way ANOVA or as indicated in the figure legends. P-values less than 0.05 were considered significant. The significant differences between data or groups are indicated in the figures by *P < 0.05 **P < 0.01 ***P < 0.001. Statistics was performed with GraphPad Prism 9.2.0. The data analysis for RNA sequencing and metabolite profiling are explained in the respective method sections.

The H. thermophilus nifH and A. vinelandii nifM nifS nifU genes were codon optimized for S. cerevisiae using the GeneOptimizer tool (Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham MA USA) and synthesized by Thermo Fisher Scientific as part of the Engineering Nitrogen Symbiosis for Africa (ENSA) project. The ZmUbi1 + 1sti:cox4-twinstrep-nifHHt:tNos construct was transferred to vector pUC57 (GenScript Piscataway NJ USA) by digesting the empty vector with BamHI and PstI and inserting the synthetic ZmUbi1 + 1sti sequence then digesting the intermediate vector with PstI and SphI and inserting the synthetic cox4-twinstrep-nifHHt:tNOS sequence. The pOsActin:su9-nifMAv:tNos construct was transferred to pUC57 by digesting the empty vector with ACC65I and XbaI and inserting the OsActin sequence then digesting the intermediate vector with XbaI and SaII and inserting the synthetic su9-nifMAv:tNos sequence. The ZmUbi1 + 1sti:su9-nifSAv:tADH1 construct was transferred to vector pUC57 by digesting the empty vector with EcoRI and BamHI inserting the synthetic ZmUbi1 + 1sti sequence then digesting the intermediate vector with BamHI and HindIII and inserting the synthetic su9-nifSAv:tADH1 sequence. The ZmUbi1 + 1sti:su9-nifUAv:tCYC1 construct was transferred to vector pUC57 by digesting the empty vector with EcoRI and SacI and inserting the synthetic ZmUbi1 + 1sti sequence then digesting the intermediate vector with SacI and BamHI and inserting the synthetic su9-nifUAv:tCYC1 sequence. All restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from Promega (Madison WI USA). Ligated plasmids were introduced into chemically competent E. coli DH5α cells and selected on lysogeny broth (LB) supplemented with 100 µg mL−1 ampicillin. The inserts were confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Stabvida Caparica Portugal). The plant expression vectors and the sequences of the genetic components are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Primers used for vector construction are listed in Supplementary Table 2.

Transformation of rice explants callus recovery and regeneration of transgenic plants

Six-day-old mature rice zygotic embryos (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare) were isolated from surface-sterilized seeds and transferred to Murashige and Skoog (MS) osmoticum medium prepared using 4.4 g L−1 MS powder (Duchefa Biochemie Haarlem Netherlands) supplemented with 0.3 g L−1 casein hydrolysate 0.5 g L−1 proline 72.8 g L−1 mannitol 30 g L−1 sucrose and 2.5 mg L−1 24-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (24-D) 4 h before bombardment with 10 mg gold particles coated with the nifH and nifM plasmids and the hpt plasmid at a 3:3:1 molar ratio42. The same method was used for co-transformation of nifS and nifU genes to assess expression. The embryos were returned to osmoticum MS medium for 16 h before selection on standard MS medium (as above without mannitol) supplemented with 2.5 mg L−1 24-D and 50 mg L−1 hygromycin in the dark for 2–3 weeks. One half of each callus clone was maintained in an undifferentiated state and the other half was transferred to regeneration medium. Regenerated plantlets were transferred to soil and grown in large flooded trays in growth chambers (28/25 °C day/night temperature with a 12-h photoperiod and 80% relative humidity)43. Plants were irrigated with tap water containing 100 μM Fe(III)-EDDHA (Sequestrene 138 Fe G-100; Syngenta Agro Madrid Spain). The Fe(III)-EDDHA solution in the trays was replaced every week. T0 plants were grown to an age of 1–2 months and harvested at the end of the dark period by cutting the whole plant down to 2–3 cm above soil level.

Gene expression analysis by quantitative real-time PCR

Total RNA was isolated from rice callus and corresponding regenerated plant leaves using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen Hilden Germany). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg total RNA using Ominiscript Reverse Transcriptase (Qiagen) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out by CFX96 system (Bio-Rad Hercules CA USA) using a 15 μl mixture containing 1.0 μl 5-fold diluted cDNA template 2× iTaq SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and 0.5 μM of each primer44. The gene-specific primers listed in Supplementary Table 2. The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by sequencing. Expression levels were normalized against OsActin mRNA. Three technical replicates were tested for each sample.

Protein extraction and immunoblot analysis

Soluble rice protein extracts were prepared by grinding ~50 mg leaf tissue (snap-frozen in liquid N 2 ) in 2 mL Eppendorf tubes using 3 mm steel-balls and a BeadBug microtube homogenizer (Benchmark Scientific Sayreville NJ USA) operating at 400 rpm for 20 s. Leaf powder was resuspended in seven volumes (v/w) of extraction buffer comprising 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.6) 200 mM NaCl and 10% glycerol supplemented with 1 mM PMSF 1 μg mL−1 leupeptin and 5 mM EDTA. After three rounds of homogenization cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was collected and stored at −80 °C.

Rice proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then immunoblotted to Protran Premium 0.45 µm nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare Chicago IL USA) using a semidry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad) at 20 V for 45 min. Similar loading was confirmed by staining polyacrylamide gels with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or staining of nitrocellulose membranes with Ponceau S. The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBST (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 150 mM NaCl 0.02% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature before incubation with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Primary monoclonal antibodies specific for strep-tagged OsNifHHt (Strep-MAB 2-1507-001; IBA Lifesciences Göttingen Germany) or polyclonal antibodies specific for NifH or NifM (polyclonal rabbit antibodies generated against A. vinelandii NifH and NifM proteins) or RuBisCO were diluted 1:2000–1:5000 in TBST supplemented with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Secondary antibodies (Invitrogen Thermo Fisher Scientific) were diluted 1:20000 in TBST supplemented with 2% non-fat milk and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Membranes were developed on medical X-ray films (AGFA Mortsel Belgium) using enhanced chemiluminescence.

Purification of NifH by STAC

OsNifHHt protein extracts were prepared for STAC purification at O 2 levels below 1 ppm in anaerobic chambers (Coy Laboratory Products Grass Lake MI USA or MBraun Garching Germany). Callus (175 g for line HtH189 234 g for HtH200 and 55 g for HtH202) was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen transferred inside the glovebox and then resuspended in lysis buffer comprising 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) 200 mM NaCl 10% glycerol 3 mM sodium dithionite (DTH) 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) 1 mM PMSF 1 μg mL−1 leupeptin 10 μg mL−1 DNAse I and 1:200 (v/v) BioLock solution (2-0205-050 IBA Lifesciences) at a ratio of 1:2 (w/v). For purification of OsNifHHt from HtH200 plants above-ground tissue (45 and 90 g for 1- and 2-months-old plants respectively) from Fe fertilized plants was harvested at the end of the 12 h dark cycle (before the onset of light) snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen transferred inside the glovebox and then resuspended in the lysis buffer at a ratio of 1:4 (w/v). The amounts of callus and plant tissue used for purifications are reported as fresh-weight. Callus and plant total extracts were prepared by mechanical disruption under an anaerobic atmosphere using a blender (Oster 4655) modified with a water-cooling system operating at full speed in four cycles of 2 min at 4 °C. The total extract was transferred to centrifuge tubes equipped with sealing closures (Beckman Coulter Brea CA USA) and centrifuged at 50000 × g for 1.5 h at 4 °C using an Avanti J-26 XP device (Beckman Coulter). The supernatant was passed through filtering cups with a pore size of 0.2 μm (Nalgene Thermo Fisher Scientific) to produce a cell-free extract containing soluble proteins. This was loaded at a flow rate of 2.5 mL min−1 onto a 5 mL Strep-Tactin XP column (IBA LifeSciences) attached to an ÄKTA FPLC system (GE Healthcare). The column was washed at 16 °C with 150 mL washing buffer comprising 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) 200 mM NaCl 10% glycerol 2 mM DTH and 5 mM 2-ME. Bound proteins were eluted with 15–20 mL washing buffer supplemented with 50 mM biotin (IBA LifeSciences). The elution fraction was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter with a cut-off pore size of 10 kDa (Merck Millipore Burlington MA USA). Biotin was removed by passing the protein through PD-10 desalting columns (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with washing buffer. Desalted eluate was further concentrated and snap-frozen in cryovials (Nalgene) and stored in liquid nitrogen.

Quantification of purified OsNifHHt protein N-terminal sequencing and MS analysis

The purified OsNifHHt protein was quantified by the densitometric analysis of Coomassie-stained gels using ImageJ45 compared to a standard of yeast ScNifBMi protein as shown in Supplementary Fig. 4. N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined by Edman degradation (Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas Madrid Spain). OsNifHHt protein (~250 pmol) was separated by SDS-PAGE transferred to a Sequi-Blot PVDF membrane with a 0.2 µm pore size (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 50 mM borate buffer (pH 9.0) stained with freshly prepared Coomassie R-250 (Sigma-Aldrich St Louis MO USA) (0.1% in 40% methanol and 10% acetic acid) and then destained using 50% methanol. OsNifHHt protein (~60 pmol) was separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining and destaining as described above. Protein excised from the gel was analyzed by mass spectrometry at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid Spain.

In vitro NifH activity analysis

OsNifHHt activity was determined in an anaerobic chamber as described15. Purified OsNifHHt was analyzed using an acetylene reduction assay following the addition of NifDKAv and ATP-regenerating mixture (1.23 mM ATP 18 mM phosphocreatine 2.2 mM MgCl 2  3 mM DTH 46 μg mL−1 creatine phosphokinase 22 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5) in a final volume of 400 μL in 9 mL serum vials containing 500 μL acetylene under an argon atmosphere. The assay was performed at 30 °C in a shaking water bath for 20 min. Reactions were stopped by adding 100 μL 8 M NaOH. Positive control reactions for acetylene reduction were carried out with NifHAv. The ethylene formed in the reaction was measured in 50-μL gas-phase samples using a Porapak N 80/100 column in a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu Duisburg Germany). The ethylene peak from reactions devoid of both NifH and NifDK proteins (no nitrogenase component added) in each experiment was subtracted from the corresponding reported ARA activities.

In vitro [Fe-S] cluster reconstitution and reconstituted NifH activity

OsNifHHt [Fe-S] cluster reconstitution in anaerobic chambers was carried out by incubating with EcNifUAv (A. vinelandii NifU expressed in and purified from E. coli cells) previously loaded with [4Fe-4S] clusters. First 20 μM NifU dimer was added to 100 mM MOPS (pH 7.5) supplemented with 8 mM 14-dithiothreitol (DTT) and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. We then added 1 mM l-cysteine 1 mM DTT 300 μM (NH 4 ) 2 Fe(SO 4 ) 2  and 225 nM NifSAv purified from E. coli (EcNifSAv) to the reduced NifU and incubated the reaction on ice for 3 h. Finally the proteins were diluted 40000-fold in 100 mM MOPS (pH 7.5) and concentrated using Amicon centrifugal filters with a 30-kDa cut off to remove excess reagents. Isolated OsNifHHt protein was mixed with the [4Fe-4S] cluster-reconstituted EcNifUAv (NifU-mediated reconstitution) and then immediately used for the acetylene reduction assay.

In vitro FeMo-co synthesis and apo-NifDKAv reconstitution

NifB-dependent FeMo-co synthesis assays were prepared in anaerobic chambers15. We assembled 100 μL reactions containing 3 μM OsNifHHt 1 μM ScNifBMt 9 μM [4Fe-4S] cluster-loaded EcNifUAv 1.5 μM apo-NifENAv 0.3 μM apo-NifDKAv 125 μM SAM 17.5 μM Na 2 MoO 4  175 μM R-homocitrate 1 mg mL−1 BSA and ATP-regenerating mixture (1.23 mM ATP 18 mM phosphocreatine 2.2 mM MgCl 2  3 mM DTH 46 μg mL−1 creatine phosphokinase 100 mM MOPS pH 7.5) at 30 °C for 1 h. In the positive control reaction the assay was carried out by using ScNifHHt instead of the rice purified variant and NifB-co (20.4 μM Fe) instead of ScNifBMt and EcNifUAv. In the negative control reaction the reaction mixture contained all the components except for any source of NifB-co or ScNifBMt and EcNifUAv. Following the in vitro synthesis and insertion of FeMo-co 17.5 μM (NH 4 ) 2 MoS 4 was added to prevent further FeMo-co incorporation into apo-NifDKAv and the reaction was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C shaking at 600 rpm. Activation of apo-NifDKAv was analyzed by adding 500 μL ATP-regenerating mixture and NifHAv (2.0 μM final concentration) in 9-mL vials containing 500 μL acetylene under argon gas. The acetylene reduction assay was performed at 30 °C for 20 min and the resulting ethylene was measured in 50 μL gas-phase samples using a Porapak N 80/100 column as described above.

Statistics and reproducibility

For enzymatic activity assays in plants the standard deviation (SD) of the mean was calculated based on two biological replicates (two technical replicates each). The standard deviation (SD) of the mean for callus activity assays was calculated based on three biological replicates (three technical replicates each). For relative gene expression analysis standard deviations (SD) were calculated based on three technical replicates.",,,

In 2009 former Biogen employee Michael Bawduniak filed a lawsuit claiming that Biogen had violated the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute by providing millions of dollars to healthcare providers (HCPs) as an incentive to prescribe three of its multiple sclerosis (MS) drugs. As per the US Department of Justice Biogen paid remuneration in the form of training and consulting fees and speaker honoraria to induce physicians to prescribe the company’s drugs in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute.

Between 2009 and 2014 the time period of Biogen’s alleged misconduct the standard of care for MS involved the use of Biogen’s immunomodulatory drugs such as Avonex (Interferon beta-1a) Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) and Tysabri (natalizumab). In 2009 Tysabri was performing well having yielded $776 million in sales after being first approved in 2004 as per Biogen’s 2009 financial filings. However new MS drugs like Novartis’ Gilenya were going to soon enter the market and increase competition within the MS therapeutic landscape. Gilenya was the first approved oral MS therapy while Avonex is delivered via biweekly injections and Tysabri requires intravenous infusion.

In the lawsuit on behalf of the government Bawduniak accused Biogen of suppressing Gilenya’s sales by arranging speaker programs and conferences at the same time as Gilenya’s launch events preventing physicians from attending the events. From 1 January 2009 through 18 March 2014 Bawduniak also alleged that Biogen’s kickback schemes led to the submission of hundreds of millions of dollars in false reimbursement claims for Biogen’s MS drugs to government healthcare programs. These along with other similar claims meant Biogen owed potential damages of $1036900151 to the US and the various States as per court documents.

The $900 million dollar settlement was previously announced in June but has only been finalised on 26 September.

The US government has recently prioritized the pursuit of cases such as Biogen’s as a warning to the industry to remain in compliance of the law. “I think that one of the government’s intended effects of pursuing these cases is deterrence and invoking future more compliant behavior from the industry” says Jonathan Ferry a partner at the Birmingham Alabama-headquartered law firm Bradley Arant Boult Cummings.

Biogen’s alleged False Claims Act violations

The False Claims Act is the American federal law that imposes liability on people and companies that defraud government organizations such as Medicare and Medicaid. This prevents fraud from being committed against the government. Under this law relators such as Bawduniak can file lawsuits on behalf of the government. In the healthcare context this includes claims for things that the government perceives as being not medically necessary. “An entity that is found liable for a False Claims Act violation has to pay back to the government three times what it received subject to the law plus additional penalties which are very substantial as well” says Ferry.

The Anti-Kickback statute is a criminal statute that can result in up to five years in prison and monetary penalties as well. “If you have a widespread anti-kickback violation all the claims submitted are false and fraudulent and the government wants all the money back from the act including treble the damages amount” explains Ferry.

In 2020 the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General released a special fraud alert showing its skepticism surrounding speaker programs like those conducted by Biogen for its MS drugs. Ferry explains “The government deems that [special fraud alert] as public notice to the industry that they are concerned about these public programs.”

Ferry describes a popular solution among pharmaceutical companies. “Some companies try to separate the clinical educational programs from their sales programs and the speaker programs are run through the clinical education programs. Having a dividing line between those can be helpful in mitigating risk and preventing the government from seeing it as fraud.”

At the same time companies need to prioritize their compliance programs. It is also important to ask whether doctors are being paid fair market value and if they are providing the services for which they’re being compensated he adds.

Biogen’s activity in multiple sclerosis

Even before the whistleblower lawsuit Biogen had been in a controversy related to its MS pipeline for different reasons. In 2005 Biogen withdrew Tysabri from the market following a clinical trial that resulted in two participants contracting progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). However Biogen was able to bring Tysabri back to the market in 2006 after providing evidence that the benefits of the drug outweighed its risk.

The company currently has three MS drugs in its pipeline. BIIB091 and BIIB107 are currently in Phase I while a Phase II orelabrutinib trial (NCT04711148) is recruiting patients. BIIB091 and orelabrutinib are Burton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors that acts by blocking the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling pathway. This prevents the development of B lymphocytes and macrophages which contribute to the pathology of MS. BIIB107 is a monoclonal antibody that targets α4 integrins which play a key role in MS pathology.

More recently Biogen has been facing competition from dimethyl fumarate generics. Tecfidera was approved in 2013 to treat MS and in August 2020 Mylan launched its first FDA-approved dimethyl fumarate generic to the market. On Monday Biogen headed to the Supreme Court in an attempt to reinstate Tecfidera’s patent but was unsuccessful. In light of this recent settlement Ferry predicts that Biogen may begin “revising their practices so that they could not be accused of this in the future to try and stay ahead of a potential problem.”

The size of the settlement is expected to spur the pharmaceutical space into some action. “When you see a number come out that was involved in a settlement people notice it and it brings forth the risks involved in these [speaker] programs” says Ferry.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpby5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS80MDg3MDkvY2lvLWd1eS1oYWRhcmktb24tdGhlLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtc2tpbGxzLXRoYXQtc2V0LWl0LWxlYWRlcnMtYXBhcnQuaHRtbNIBaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpby5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS80MDg3MDkvY2lvLWd1eS1oYWRhcmktb24tdGhlLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtc2tpbGxzLXRoYXQtc2V0LWl0LWxlYWRlcnMtYXBhcnQuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CIO Guy Hadari on the management skills that set IT leaders apart,"To Guy Hadari CIO of Biogen the most important but often overlooked skill for a CIO is management.

“Most people consider the CIO to be a technology person and they want to put them in a technology box but technology should be only 20% of a CIO’s job” says Hadari who has been leading IT for the $15 billion biotech business since March 2021. “CIOs need to understand infrastructure security and business applications at a high level but it is more important that they know how to manage a business function. A CIO with a half billion-dollar budget is essentially the CEO of a very complex business.”

As Hadari sees it “The challenge is that most up-and-coming IT professionals are trained to be technology implementers and innovators and so are ill equipped for the management aspects of the job” something that he experienced personally. In his first few years as CIO Hadari’s comfort zone was data analytics and statistics and that was the lens he used to lead IT. “Although my early years focused on the application of technology to business problems it was during my years in management roles with IBM that I started to see that technology depth was keeping me from being a good manager.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEwLzA1L2JldHRlci1hbHpoZWltZXJzLWRpc2Vhc2Utc3RvY2stZWxpLWxpbGx5LW9yLWJpb2dlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Alzheimer's Disease Stock: Eli Lilly or Biogen?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEwLzA1L2JldHRlci1hbHpoZWltZXJzLWRpc2Vhc2Utc3RvY2stZWxpLWxpbGx5LW9yLWJpb2dlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC7CC7FD0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEwLzA1L2JldHRlci1hbHpoZWltZXJzLWRpc2Vhc2Utc3RvY2stZWxpLWxpbGx5LW9yLWJpb2dlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd2h5eS5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZXMvbmV3LWRydWctdHJlYXRtZW50LWFsemhlaW1lcnMtZGlzZWFzZS_SAURodHRwczovL3doeXkub3JnL2FydGljbGVzL25ldy1kcnVnLXRyZWF0bWVudC1hbHpoZWltZXJzLWRpc2Vhc2UvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New potential drug treatment for Alzheimer’s disease has Pa. patients advocates and doctors hopeful,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='whyy.org', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/new-drug-treatment-alzheimers-disease/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC894ECB0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd2h5eS5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZXMvbmV3LWRydWctdHJlYXRtZW50LWFsemhlaW1lcnMtZGlzZWFzZS_SAURodHRwczovL3doeXkub3JnL2FydGljbGVzL25ldy1kcnVnLXRyZWF0bWVudC1hbHpoZWltZXJzLWRpc2Vhc2UvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS9uZXctYWx6aGVpbWVycy1kcnVnLXNsb3dzLWNvZ25pdGl2ZS1kZWNsaW5lLWFuZC1tYXktYmUtYXZhaWxhYmxlLWFzLWVhcmx5LWFzLW5leHQteWVhci0xOTE2MjfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Alzheimer's drug slows cognitive decline – and may be available as early as next year,"Lecanemab is the first drug to help improve the symptoms of Alzheimer’s by slowing the disease. These are very promising results although the only data we have at the moment is from the drugmaker’s press release.

Lecanemab is an antibody that finds and removes a protein called amyloid that builds up and forms clumps in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease. By targeting amyloid lecanemab is striking at the heart of the disease itself rather than just treating symptoms by boosting brain chemicals in the cells that are still working (as is the case with drugs currently prescribed for Alzheimer’s).

Previous antibody drugs to remove amyloid have not worked or have generated mixed results. As there are lots of other abnormal proteins in Alzheimer’s disease the failure of the amyloid antibody trials led to a debate about whether amyloid really is an important problem in Alzheimer’s disease.

This debate is now over. Regardless of whether other biological processes are important in the development of Alzheimer’s the data from the phase 3 lecanemab trial tells us that amyloid is a central problem in the disease. This will help focus future investment in clinical trials and laboratory research.

Eisai the maker of lecanemab has already filed for “accelerated approval” with the US Food and Drug Administration. If all goes to plan the drug could be licensed as early as January 2023. But there are important questions still to be answered even if the final published data is exactly as it is in the press release.

The amyloid hypothesis explained

Hurdles still to overcome

There is a small risk of significant side-effects with lecanemab including brain swelling and bleeding. Most people are unaware when this happens to them but around 3% suffer small bleeds in the brain.

We do not yet know the severity of these bleeds. It may well be that doctors will be able to predict who is likely to develop them but it will take a few years of giving the drug in clinical practice to better understand the side-effects and how best to manage them.

People who are prescribed the drug will need regular MRI scans to check for brain swelling or bleeding. These are enormous new healthcare costs and we have no idea yet how much the drug itself will cost.

Another hurdle is identifying people with early-stage Alzheimer’s who might benefit from this drug. This means doctors need to ensure people are referred to memory clinics as early as possible. Many of these people with mild memory symptoms won’t have Alzheimer’s disease. (Who hasn’t had a mild memory lapse?)

To identify patients who actually have Alzheimer’s disease doctors will need to use new blood tests. And with recent advances doctors are on the cusp of being able to do this.

The way the drug is currently given (intravenously via a cannula twice a month) could also be off-putting for many patients. However Eisai is developing a formulation so that lecanemab can be injected into the fat layer under the skin – like an insulin injection – which may encourage more people to use the drug.

Cost v benefit

So is the benefit worth the risk and cost? Lecanemab slowed the rate of cognitive decline in people with mild cognitive impairment and early-stage Alzheimer’s disease by 27% over 18 months. This effect is similar to that seen with current drugs (cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine) but these drugs don’t affect the underlying causes of the disease.

If the effects of lecanemab remain stable for longer than 18 months a patient with mild cognitive impairment who is destined to have six years of independent life without treatment could gain around 19 extra months of independent life. But will patients and regulators view this reward as worth the potential risk of side-effects?

We should have answers to these questions fairly soon. But in the meantime we can celebrate the fact that we finally have proof that amyloid is a causal factor in the most common form of dementia. And after many years of slow progress that’s something to be excited about as it shows that dementia researchers have been on the right track all along."

As makers of food beverage cleaning and personal care necessities CPG companies have prioritized both monetary and product donations and are regularly developing partnerships and launching individual efforts to meet needs at the local and national levels.

In total the CPG industry contributes nearly $2 billion in donations annually to charitable causes across the country — the second highest donation level among all major industries according to a PwC analysis of IRS data.

Here are a few examples of how industry companies are supporting communities and reducing food and product insecurity.

Bimbo Bakeries Bush Brothers & Company Campbell Soup Company Danone Dole Packaged Foods Ferreo Ferrera General Mills J.M. Smucker Kellogg’s Keurig Dr. Pepper PepsiCo The Coca-Cola Company and the Clorox Company are all participating supplies in Feeding America’s Fight Hunger Spark Change program which has secured more than 1.5 billion meals for local food banks across the country.

Conagra launched its Shine The Light On Hunger campaign a yearly campaign that works to provide meals to the greater Omaha community. Last year the campaign surpassed its goal of raising 2 million meals by 453% – the final number was over 9 million meals.

Hormel Foods has donated more than $50 million in cash and product donations to nonprofit organizations in the last five years including $6.4 million in hunger-relief donations in 2020. The company is also a partner with Slice Out Hunger and has been for several years.

Kellogg’s launched its Better Days initiative that has a goal to end hunger for 3 billion people by the end of 2030.

Land O’Lakes launched a program in partnership with Feeding America called First Run which has donated over 6.4 million pounds of product since 2010.

Sargento launched their Touchdown for Hunger that aims to tackle hunger relief across Wisconsin. The program is in its 19th season and has raised more than $1.6 million.

For the first time in over 50 years the White House Conference on Hunger Nutrition and Health was convened to discuss solutions to food policy hunger and increasing dietary health. Ahead of the conference CPG companies answered the call by making new commitments to fight these issues affecting households across the country. Here are notable commitments from the industry:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi_AFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMi8xMC8wNC8yNTI3ODM0LzAvZW4vRGVtYW5kLWZvci1HbG9iYWwtSG90LVNhdWNlLU1hcmtldC1TaXplLXRvLVN1cnBhc3MtVVNELTQtOTEtQmlsbGlvbi1ieS0yMDI2LUV4aGliaXQtYS1DQUdSLW9mLTctOS1Ib3QtU2F1Y2UtSW5kdXN0cnktVHJlbmRzLVNoYXJlLVZhbHVlLUFuYWx5c2lzLUZvcmVjYXN0LVJlcG9ydC1ieS1GYWN0cy1GYWN0b3JzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Demand for Global Hot Sauce Market Size to Surpass USD 4.91 Billion by 2026 Exhibit a CAGR of 7.9% | Hot Sauce ...,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMi_AFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMi8xMC8wNC8yNTI3ODM0LzAvZW4vRGVtYW5kLWZvci1HbG9iYWwtSG90LVNhdWNlLU1hcmtldC1TaXplLXRvLVN1cnBhc3MtVVNELTQtOTEtQmlsbGlvbi1ieS0yMDI2LUV4aGliaXQtYS1DQUdSLW9mLTctOS1Ib3QtU2F1Y2UtSW5kdXN0cnktVHJlbmRzLVNoYXJlLVZhbHVlLUFuYWx5c2lzLUZvcmVjYXN0LVJlcG9ydC1ieS1GYWN0cy1GYWN0b3JzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018ECABB22F0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi_AFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMi8xMC8wNC8yNTI3ODM0LzAvZW4vRGVtYW5kLWZvci1HbG9iYWwtSG90LVNhdWNlLU1hcmtldC1TaXplLXRvLVN1cnBhc3MtVVNELTQtOTEtQmlsbGlvbi1ieS0yMDI2LUV4aGliaXQtYS1DQUdSLW9mLTctOS1Ib3QtU2F1Y2UtSW5kdXN0cnktVHJlbmRzLVNoYXJlLVZhbHVlLUFuYWx5c2lzLUZvcmVjYXN0LVJlcG9ydC1ieS1GYWN0cy1GYWN0b3JzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhc3Rpbmd0YWJsZS5jb20vMTAzODYxNS90aGUtcmVhbC1yZWFzb24tYnJhbmRzLXB1dC1yZWNpcGVzLW9uLXRoZS1iYWNrLW9mLXByb2R1Y3RzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Real Reason Brands Put Recipes On The Back Of Products,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.tastingtable.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /1038615/the-real-reason-brands-put-recipes-on-the-back-of-products/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018ECABB3730>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhc3Rpbmd0YWJsZS5jb20vMTAzODYxNS90aGUtcmVhbC1yZWFzb24tYnJhbmRzLXB1dC1yZWNpcGVzLW9uLXRoZS1iYWNrLW9mLXByb2R1Y3RzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy53b3JjZXN0ZXJtYWcuY29tL3N0b3J5L2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvY29sdW1ucy8yMDIyLzEwLzA0L3NjcmVlbi10aW1lLWxhc3NpZS1zdGFyLWpvbi1wcm92b3N0LWFwcGVhci1jYW5uYWJpcy1jb252ZW50aW9uLzgxNjU0NDMwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Screen Time: 'Lassie' star Jon Provost to appear at cannabis convention,"If you hear little Timmy Martin from your black-and-white TV childhood calling out “Lassie! Lassie!” this weekend you’re not high.

Let me rephrase that. You’re not necessarily high but you might be that is if you’re attending The HighLifeStyleShow Oct. 7-9 at the Boxboro Regency Hotel & Conference Center.

Jon Provost who played Timmy on “Lassie” for seven seasons is one of the show’s guests.

“I’ve done tons and tons of autograph shows comic cons you name it. But this is the first time I’ve done a cannabis-only event” Provost said on the phone last week. “It’s going to be a blast. It’s going to be a great event. I’m absolutely looking forward to it for sure.”

The HighLifeStyleShow will offer entertainment along with opportunities for consumers to learn about all the choices available to them and for top level executives brand managers marketing professionals cultivators innovators influencers and advocates to meet their colleagues and customers.

Not only is he going to be posing and signing autographs but dog owners are invited to bring their beloved pets to have a photo with Provost. The event is open to anyone 21 or older.

Cheech Marin half of the iconic comedy team of Cheech and Chong will deliver the keynote address Saturday and be signing autographs and offering photo ops (both for a fee) Saturday and Sunday.

Other entertainment includes The Wailers “Cannabis! A Viper Vaudeville” Roots of Creation Tsunami of Sound Walter Sickert & The Army of Broken Toys Mikaela Davis and her band Southern Star Barrence Whitfield Justine’s Black Threads and Jon Butcher Axis.

Provost — a self-proclaimed “product of the ‘60s and the ‘70s in Southern California” — said the first time he smoked a joint was back in 1966.

“It was my brother who was six years older who turned me on to cannabis. It was a different time. And back then it was sex drugs and rock ‘n’ roll all the fun” Provost said. “Cannabis has been part of my life on and off my whole adult life growing up here. And how it has progressed now with the medical side and the CBDs (aka cannabidiol an active ingredient in cannabis that is derived from the hemp plant) cannabis is becoming mainstream.”

While he confesses that he has had some issues in the past with alcohol Provost boasts that he has never had an issue with being under the influence of cannabis.

Long before he was lobbying for cannabis Provost captured America’s heart as the pintsize human sidekick to a female Rough Collie on CBS’s long-running television series “Lassie.”

Far removed from Hollywood neither of Provost’s parents (an aeronautical engineer father and a homemaker mother) were showbusiness people. And his career as a child star started because his mother idolized Jane Wyman.

“My mother read an ad in the L.A. Times that Warner Brothers was looking for a 3-year-old blond boy to be in this movie starring Jane Wyman. So my mom thought if she took me on this audition she was going to meet Jane Wyman” Provost said. He landed the role in the 1953 film “So Big.”

“I ended up getting the job and all my mother wanted was Jane Wyman’s autograph” he said.

“Lassie” made its debut Sept. 12 1954. In 1957 child actor Tommy Rettig who played Jeff Miller on “Lassie” wanted to leave the show. So the studio started looking for a wholesome all-American boy for his replacement but they were striking out.

One day the wife of the producer of “Lassie” was having lunch with the wife of the producer of the RKO film “Escapade In Japan” starring Teresa Wright Cameron Mitchell and Provost.

“We’re filming this movie and these women are having lunch and it comes up ‘Oh we’re looking for a kid to be on the ‘Lassie’ series and we can't find one.’ … She described what they wanted the kid to look like and the (other) woman said ‘Oh wait a minute. We’re filming a child right now. He’s in Japan’” Provost said. “When I got back from Japan I met with the producers of 'Lassie' and the director and they said ‘Yes. You’re the kid we want. You look exactly like we want.’”

Provost was 7 at the time but looked like he was 4 or 5 which worked to his advantage. Although they knew Provost could act from his previous work they didn’t know if he would get along with the dog playing Lassie.

“They had a bunch of other kids that they were looking at that they were scared of the big dog” Provost said. “So I spend the weekend with Rudd Weatherwax the owner and trainer of Lassie and a couple of his dogs on his ranch. Then I came to the studio on Monday with everybody. We walked in the office and Lassie walked up to the producer and gave me two paws up and that’s how I got the job.”

Provost worked with three different dogs who played Lassie. He worked with Lassie Junior the son of Pal who was the MGM Lassie. Next Provost briefly worked with Spook Lassie Junior’s son. But Spook got nervous on the set and wasn’t working out great. Then Weatherwax brought in Spook’s brother Baby who was a natural four-legged showman and great to work with Provost said.

From the age of 9 to 14 Provost said he worked with Baby for five years.

“Baby was young. That’s why his nickname was Baby. But he was incredible. He took over. He was so smart and so beautiful” Provost said. “We grew up together. And I loved that dog and he loved me but you know what? If I asked him to do something sit or shake hands he would look at me and say ‘Wait a minute. You’re my friend. You’re not my trainer.’ Baby was my favorite.”

In seven years Provost shot 249 half-hour episodes of “Lassie” which averages out to 24 to 36 episodes a year.

Provost — who was good friends with fellow TV child stars Larry Mathews (“The Dick Van Dyke Show”) Jay North (“Dennis the Menace”) and Ronny Howard (“The Andy Griffith Show”) — worked five days a week 10 hours a day nine months out of the year.

While they were working Provost like a dog they pampered Baby like he was royalty feeding him the best food and even giving him a special mat on wheels that he could nap on during breaks and could be dragged without disturbing his sleep to the next location.

“Sometimes I’d get tired and he was warm and fuzzy and I lay down on his bed and sleep with him” Provost recalled.

Also on a given day they could be filming from three different scripts Provost said.

“For me it was kind of hard to figure out what the storyline really was. And I’m a little kid so I didn’t pay a lot of attention anyways” Provost said. “Then every Sunday night my whole family would sit down in the TV room and watch “Lassie” … at seven o’clock on CBS and I would say ‘Oh now I know why I did that.’”

Provost said his favorite “Lassie” guest star was Ted Knight who played a ventriloquist who had a dog for a dummy (and Lassie thought the dog dummy was real).

When Provost started “Lassie” his parental units were played by Cloris Leachman and Jon Shepodd but Leachman didn’t work out so they let her out of her contract. Not only was she unpopular with viewers she was reportedly a terror on the set.

“After a few months of filming Cloris Leachman decided ‘Whoa man I just signed a contract that I’m going to be stuck on this farm with this kid and this dog for the next six years. I want out'” Provost recalled. “Then one Sunday people were watching 'Lassie' and Jon Shepodd and Cloris Leachman as my parents and the next Sunday it was Hugh Reilly and June Lockhart in the same roles. The studio didn’t get one letter asking what’s happening here … Because the people didn’t care. They were watching the kid and the dog. That’s what people watched ‘Lassie’ for.”

By the spring of 1964 “Lassie” received its highest rating ever ranking at No. 13.

The same year Provost chose not to renew his contract although Campbell’s Soup Company the show’s sponsor wanted the show for three more years.

“I was 14. I was starting to go through puberty. I was getting more interested in girls than dogs. But all the girls thought of me as this little boy Timmy with the dog” Provost recalled. “I told my parents I want to continue to act but I’m tired of Timmy. And they said 'OK.' It was time for me to leave 'Lassie' and move on.”

Campbell’s Soup Company signed on early as the sole sponsor of “Lassie” and remained so for the show’s entire 19-season run to the chagrin of Provost.

“Every Christmas June Lockhart and Hugh Reilly and I would get a big basket filled with Campbell’s Soup and Pepperidge Farm and all the stuff that they make but it was all the stuff that didn’t sell” Provost recalled. “Dented cans and broken cookies that’s what they gave us.”

The first acting gig Provost got after “Lassie” was a guest spot on “Mr. Ed.”

“So I went from the smartest dog to the smartest horse” Provost said.

Provost did gain something special from his time from “Lassie” a special mother-child bond between him and Lockhart.

“She (Lockhart) was my mother and she will always be my mother” Provost said of Lockhart whom he is still very close to even today. “My mom passed away quite awhile ago and she would be proud that I said that.”

One day Provost in his own admission was being a brat on the set of “Lassie” and Lockhart gave him a lecture that he has never forgotten and still holds near and dear to his heart.

“June took me aside and sat me down and said ‘Young man you are a professional. I am a professional. I play an adult. You play a child. Someday you will be playing an adult. So you’re a professional act like one’” Provost said. “And guess what? It worked.”

Today ""Lassie"" can be seen in more than 50 countries in reruns and Provost still gets emails from all over the world. Despite its popularity Provost didn’t get rich on doing “Lassie.”

“Nobody from those old shows — 'Leave It To Beaver' 'My Three Sons' 'The Donna Reed Show' you name it — we don’t get residuals” Provost said. “I haven’t gotten a 'Lassie' residual in 60 years. It was not in our contract.”

Provost said he’s excited that he just finished his first sci-fi movie “Colonials” which he hopes will be out in theaters and streaming later this year.

“Aliens have taken over the world and we’re coming back and reclaiming the Earth” Provost said. “And I’m (the voice of) a robot. Far out!”

Paige Thompson who used the name ""erratic"" online was arrested in July 2019 after Capital One alerted the Federal Bureau of Investigations to the hack. A jury found Thompson guilty in June 2022.

During the sentencing hearing Tuesday U.S. District Judge Robert S. Lasnik said that time in prison would be difficult because of her mental health and the ""widely recognized medical mental and physical risks she will face in prison as a transgender woman.""

U.S. Attorney Nick Brown said they were disappointed in the court's decision saying “Ms. Thompson’s hacking and theft of information of 100 million people did more than $250 million in damage to companies and individuals. Her cybercrimes created anxiety for millions of people who are justifiably concerned about their private information.""



The 2019 data breach prompted Capital One to reach a $190 million settlement with affected customers. The Treasury Department also fined the company $80 million for failing to protect the data.

Thompson’s attorneys argued at trial that she struggled with mental health issues never intended to profit from the data she obtained and said in court papers that “there is no credible or direct evidence that a single person’s identity was misused.”

Federal prosecutors said she didn’t just steal the data but also planted software on servers she unlawfully accessed to steal computing power to mine cryptocurrency.

A hearing will be held on Dec. 1 2022 to determine the amount of restitution Thompson must pay to her victims.

Read part one: Hospitals face ‘broad and serious threats’ as pandemic-related losses mount.

When the pandemic hit in early 2020 Ballad Health stopped all non-emergency surgeries and furloughed about 1200 people.

None of them were nurses.

There was little need for nursing staff in departments like surgical or post-op and the loss of surgeries was a big blow to Ballad’s bottom line. The normal practice would have been to send those employees home but the health system instead did the opposite: It kept them on and guaranteed their hours.

Ballad which operates hospitals and other health care facilities across Southwest Virginia and Northeast Tennessee couldn’t risk losing any of its nurses said president and CEO Alan Levine – not at the beginning of a global health crisis and not in the middle of what was already a nursing shortage.

“We knew we were taking a big financial hit but we were trying to dodge what we knew would become a bullet later” Levine said.

The strategy got them through the first big COVID surge. But the bullet eventually found its target and not just at Ballad.

A May report by Kaufman Hall a health care consulting firm found that almost 1 in 5 health care workers quit their jobs during the pandemic. The pain has been felt across hospital workforces but it has been particularly dire among nursing staffs.

The impacts to hospitals’ bottom lines are continuing to mount. The shortfall prompted health systems to raise nurses’ wages and offer signing bonuses. When that didn’t work they turned to staffing agencies to fill shifts paying hourly rates double and even triple what they paid their own staff nurses.

The staffing shortage has been one of the primary reasons hospital systems have struggled financially during the pandemic. Hospital labor expenses have increased by more than a third from pre-pandemic levels Kaufman Hall found.

But even the increased spending hasn’t guaranteed that hospital operations would return to normal. More than 30% of respondents to a survey of rural hospital leaders this summer by the Chartis Group said nurse staffing shortages have led them to suspend or consider suspending services. More than a third told the health care consultant that a lack of nurses had limited how many patients they’d been able to admit within the last 60 days.

In September Ballad had 2500 staffing vacancies representing more than 18% of its workforce. A thousand of those open jobs were in nursing. Roanoke-based Carilion Clinic was looking to hire 685 nurses. Centra Health in Lynchburg 200.

“The nursing crisis is not going to go away. It’s there” said J.B. Silvers interim co-dean and a professor of health care finance at the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University.

Nurses are opting out of the traditional employment market because they want more money and more control over their schedules he said.

“They’ve opted out by going to the agencies by going to the traveling nurse market which then lets them get twice as much money as they would otherwise” he said. “What’s wrong with this picture? It’s not sustainable.”

Experts had been warning for years that a nursing shortage was coming.

Members of the massive baby boom generation were aging and would soon need more medical care. At the same time a wave of nursing retirements was looming and nursing schools were struggling to meet the demand because of hiring pressures of their own.

[Read Cardinal News’ previous coverage of the nursing shortage here.]

COVID-19 exacerbated the crash. After months of dealing with the strain of the pandemic many experienced nurses took early retirement. Some younger nurses fresh out of school decided this wasn’t what they’d signed up for and left the profession.

And many others decided to give up their staff jobs for lucrative travel gigs creating further shortages.

Contract nurses were generally paid more than staff nurses even before the pandemic; the job which can require being away from home for months on end needed to pay well to attract strong candidates.

But those wage disparities have ballooned according to Kaufman Hall. In 2019 the median hourly wage for contract nurses was $64. By the beginning of this year it had reached $132.

Over the same period the median hourly wage for staff nurses rose from $35 to $39.

Local health systems’ contract labor expenses As the nursing shortage continues hospitals increasingly have come to rely on contract nurses to fill shifts. The staffing help comes at a cost: While the median hourly wage for staff nurses was $39 at the beginning of the year it was $132 for contract nurses. Carilion Clinic paid $39 million a year for contract labor before the pandemic. In the current fiscal year: $137 million.

Centra Health paid $17.8 million in contract wages in 2020. In the first six months of 2022: $50.4 million.

Ballad Health paid $22.9 million for contract labor in the first three months of 2021. The same period this year: $41.2 million. Source: Kaufman Hall health systems’ financial statements interviews.

Hospitals’ overall labor expenses are projected to increase this year by $86 billion over 2021 Kaufman Hall reported.

Just as the staffing shortage wasn’t caused by COVID-19 it isn’t likely to abate even as COVID shifts to its endemic phase a May report by McKinsey & Co. found. In fact the lingering effects of the pandemic – such as cases of long COVID or COVID-related kidney damage – are likely to drive increased hospitalizations for some years; the consulting firm predicted that by 2025 inpatient hospitalization days will have increased by up to 12% over 2019.

And highly contagious coronavirus variants continue to sweep across the U.S. leading to more patients – and more illness among staff. Earlier this fall when the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants were prevalent in Southwest Virginia up to 250 employees were calling out sick every day in Carilion Clinic’s system CEO Nancy Agee said.

There are two ways to ease the health care staffing shortage: create (or keep) more employees or figure out how to get the job done with fewer people.

Ideas for how to do the former are being debated and tested and have been since before the pandemic brought the nursing problem into such stark relief: expand the size of nursing schools change how clinical rotations are done offer scholarships proselytize about the benefits of the job to ever-younger kids raise pay offer signing bonuses increase schedule flexibility.

“No profession has been more negatively affected by COVID than the nursing profession” Ballad’s Levine said. “They’ve been abused for two and a half years. They’ve been overworked they’ve been short-staffed. They go to work every day wearing a mask for 12 hours and dealing with PPE [personal protective equipment] and dealing with people who for a long time didn’t even believe it when we told them they had COVID.”

The shortage is as bad as he’s seen in 30 years he said.

“We’ve got work to do as an industry to recapture the imagination of young people … to inspire them about what a noble profession nursing is and get them interested in the profession” he said. “I’m very concerned about this.”

Ballad last year worked with East Tennessee State University to create the Appalachian Highlands Center for Nursing Advancement. HCA the for-profit health system that operates LewisGale hospitals in Southwest Virginia is offering scholarships to nursing students who commit to working in the region for a year.

At the same time hospital systems are increasingly trying to figure out how to make do with the staff they have instead of the staff they used to have or the staff that they want.

Agee at Carilion wants to explore using paramedics in emergency departments and home health settings something that’s not currently allowed in Virginia but that she thinks could alleviate some staffing shortages. Carilion also is looking at ways to use technology – anything from robots to artificial intelligence – to free up clinical staff to focus on the patients who need them the most.

Health systems might be able to learn a few things from other industries the McKinsey report suggested. Airlines for instance have embraced a model that has customers now doing much of the work that employees used to do like booking flights. Health care may never be as do-it-yourself as budget travel but some providers are testing the waters: In Sweden health care providers have launched self-dialysis where patients perform their own dialysis and nurses follow up remotely.

The report also suggested that providers turn to technologies like predictive analytics and artificial intelligence to better match staffing with clinical needs.

Levine’s understanding of the staffing shortages goes well beyond what he sees in his job. His wife an intensive care unit nurse went back to work during the pandemic to help. As of Friday Ballad had 18 COVID patients in ICUs and a total of 77 patients hospitalized with COVID.

When Levine’s mother fell this summer in Atlanta it took an hour for an ambulance to arrive. Once she got to the hospital she lay on a gurney for 10 hours with a broken hip and wrist before a doctor saw her he said.

He was upset for her he said but not angry with the hospital because he understands the pressure that it must have been under. (The hospital Atlanta Medical Center announced recently that it’s closing Nov. 1 after losing more than $100 million in the last year. It’s also the hospital where Levine was born.)

“This is happening to patients every day” Levine said. “There are people here who believe that Ballad Health created this. It breaks my heart to hear it because I know how hard our team is working to mitigate the problem.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9kaXNwb3NhYmxlLWdsb3Zlcy1sZWFkZXItdHJhZGV4LWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtMTk0NTAwOTg5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disposable Gloves Leader Tradex International Acquired and Renamed Tradex Holdings LLC,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='finance.yahoo.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/disposable-gloves-leader-tradex-international-194500989.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC7D706A0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9kaXNwb3NhYmxlLWdsb3Zlcy1sZWFkZXItdHJhZGV4LWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtMTk0NTAwOTg5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8wNC96aXBsaW5lcy1kcm9uZXMtdG8tZGVsaXZlci1tZWRpY2luZS1pbi1zYWx0LWxha2UtY2l0eS1hcmVhL9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8wNC96aXBsaW5lcy1kcm9uZXMtdG8tZGVsaXZlci1tZWRpY2luZS1pbi1zYWx0LWxha2UtY2l0eS1hcmVhL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Zipline’s drones to deliver medicine in Salt Lake City area,"Zipline a drone delivery and logistics company that got its start delivering medical supplies in Africa has started dropping prescriptions and over-the-counter medications to homes in the Salt Lake City Utah area.

In a partnership with Intermountain Healthcare a healthcare company that services the Intermountain Region of the United States Zipline will deploy an initial fleet of five electric autonomous drones out of its Salt Lake Valley distribution center. The startup is promising on-demand deliveries directly to patients’ homes in “as little as 15 minutes” and plans to gradually expand to cater to more than 1 million customers over the next five years Zipline said in a statement Tuesday.

While Zipline has been deploying drones in Africa starting in Rwanda since 2016 the company gained U.S. market entry in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Zipline partnered with Novant Health to distribute personal protective gear and medical equipment in North Carolina — a distribution network that has since expanded to include Cardinal Health and Magellan Rx Management. Later that same year Zipline began a partnership with Walmart in Arkansas initially to deploy health and wellness supplies and has since expanded to more general products in the future.

During the pandemic the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) granted Zipline an emergency waiver to operate without the proper certification. In June Zipline finally received its FAA Part 135 air carrier certification which authorized the company to complete long-range on-demand commercial drone deliveries in the United States.

Now certain customers in Utah will look up into the sky to see a 45-pound fixed-wing aircraft that looks like a tiny airplane quietly humming above a patient’s house as it parachutes a box down into their yard. Zipline says its autonomous aircraft are constantly taking in surrounding information like wind speed and direction so they can accurately drop packages within a target area “about the size of a couple parking spaces.”

The drones which fly up to 400 feet above ground level are monitored by trained remote pilots who can intervene if necessary.

Zipline’s latest launch will initially service communities within a few miles of its distribution center located in South Jordan. The startup’s drones can fly up to a 50-mile radius in most weather conditions Zipline said. Over the next five years Zipline plans to add new distribution centers to its network so it can deliver to around 90% of households and community drop-off locations in the Salt Lake Valley area. After that Zipline has its eyes on broader expansion in Utah.

Interested customers within the Intermountain Healthcare network can start signing up to use the service. While the service is ideal for people who are less mobile are sick or have work obligations that make it difficult to make it to the pharmacy for their meds Zipline says the service is for everyone. Zipline will evaluate whether it can deliver to homes based on factors like yard size location and surrounding airspace a company spokesperson told TechCrunch."

If your car experienced severe damage due to the hurricane here are what experts recommend for your next few steps.

Steps to take if you sustain hurricane damage

According to AAA Spokesman Mark Jenkins there have been 500 claims so far since Ian ended. While it's still too early to tell he believes it is on the same level of Irma and Charley.

Widespread flooding will likely result in significant damage to vehicles. Flooding is often covered by ""comprehensive"" auto insurance policies. However because Floridians are not required to carry this coverage option some may not be protected.

When a car has been partially or completely submerged AAA recommends the following:

Do not attempt to start a vehicle if the water level rose above the door opening and the interior of the car is wet. Doing so could cause major problems if flood water has contaminated the engine oil or other vehicle fluids.

Take photos from the exterior of the vehicle. Do not open the doors if the water levels are still high.

Once the waters have receded take photos of the interior.

Contact your insurance provider.

Jenkins said once residents' contact their provider to file a claim it likely will be a week out before they hear back.

When going to your insurance provider bring as much information and evidence as possible including when and where the storm occurred and what types of damage your car sustained with photos and videos provided.

Once an appraiser has inspected the vehicle and determined the damage they should receive a copy of the estimate as well as a recommendation of reputable auto shops. Whether the car has minimal damage or is completely damaged Jenkins said it is the same coverage and deducible.

'Buyers beware situation'

Some will be looking forward to using insurance funds to buy a car. However there's a chance that could turn into its own potential nightmare if you're not careful.

Carmax says there is potential for Hurricane Ian-damaged cars to end up back on used car lots.

""Customers should be aware that some businesses and individuals may try to sell salvaged and flood damaged vehicles without disclosing their condition"" Carmax said it a release. ""We encourage all customers to check the car history report to see if there is flood history noted or a salvage title has been issued on the vehicle. When possible we also recommend having the vehicle checked out by a trusted mechanic before purchase.""

Flood-damaged cars can be dangerous because water can ""permanently damage computers and electrical systems that control many aspects of the car"" including gas and brake pedals steering and gear shifts and safety and warning sensors.

On top of checking vehicle history and shopping with reputable dealers CarMax officials recommend the following when looking to purchase a car:

Moldy smell inside the car. Feel the carpet for dampness.

Be suspicious of an older car with brand new interior or carpeting.

Look for dirt under the dashboard and floor mats.

Check inside the trunk under the carpet and in the spare tire well area for rust dirt or sand.

Look for corrosion water marks or a thin brown line on the exterior of the vehicle.

Check to see if the electrical system works.

Be suspicious if a deal/price sound too good to be true especially compared to similar car makes and models in your area.

What do you use now if you don't have any transportation?

Are rental cars available in SWFL?

As of Oct. 4 these are the only car rental services with vehicle options:

Carnival has some of the most ""Fun Ships at Sea"" so you’re certainly in for a great time during your cruise!

Currently Carnival Cruise Line operates 27 ships across its fleet making it one of the largest cruise lines in the world. These cruise ships are classified into nine different ship classes each with their own special flair.

Image

Cruise lines build multiple ships that are nearly identical in both size and design; these are then classified as different ship classes for the cruise line's fleet. Built in a similar timeframe each class of ships almost represents a snapshot in time with its design elements amenities onboard and technological capabilities.

Image

While Carnival Cruise Line is one of the biggest cruise lines in the world in terms of fleet size they don't operate the largest ships at sea. Most of the ships sailed by Carnival are nearly 40% smaller than the ships sailed by rival cruise line Royal Caribbean which is known for building the biggest cruise ships in the world including the largest ship at sea: Icon of the Seas.

In fact most cruise ships for Carnival Cruise Line would be considered mid-size ships by today’s industry standards. While Royal Caribbean and MSC are building some of the world’s biggest ships Carnival Cruise Line continues to operate and build modestly-sized ships.

Additionally Carnival takes a more incremental approach to design changes between ship classes. Cruisers will likely find plenty of commonalities and similarities across the Carnival fleet even when ships are in different classes. For example while the newer Vista and Dream Class ships are sizably bigger these ships have a similar look and feel to Carnival's older Splendor Class ships.

Image

Until Mardi Gras debuted in 2021 most of the ships in Carnival’s fleet were largely very similar even as they varied in age and size.

Below we will break down all nine of the cruise ship classes for Carnival Cruise Line.

Excel Class

Image

Mardi Gras (2021)

Carnival Celebration (2022)

Carnival Jubilee (2023)

Unnamed Excel ship (2027)

As the newest class of ships for Carnival Cruise Line the Excel Class is bringing the biggest changes to the cruise line’s fleet. With a totally new design and slew of incredible amenities Mardi Gras Carnival Celebration and Carnival Jubilee compete with the biggest ships sailing by rival cruise lines.

Excel Class ships all have a gross tonnage of around 180000 making these the largest cruise ships sailing for Carnival. These ships are nearly 40% bigger than any other Carnival ship in the fleet and offer the most lounges bars and eateries of any Carnival ship sailing.

Image

When it comes to passenger capacity Excel Class ships can hold 6500 passengers if every bed onboard is occupied. On average you can expect to find about 5000 passengers sailing.

In 2021 Carnival Mardi Gras made its highly-anticipated debut and introduced the industry’s first roller coaster at sea named BOLT: The Ultimate Sea Coaster. Additionally Mardi Gras was the first LNG-powered cruise ship for the cruise line which is a cleaner fuel alternative.

In 2022 Carnival Celebration joined the fleet as the cruise line’s second ship in the Excel Class. Carnival Jubilee debuted as the third ship in Carnival's Excel Class in December 2023. The success of the Excel ships led Carnival to seek a fourth. Meyer Werft recently announced that they have undertaken the task and are responsible for the fourth ship which is set to launch in 2027 if all goes according to plan.

Image

Those who love sailing on mega-ships will want to consider sailing on one of these massive ships. Also those who prefer to sail in suites will appreciate the largest array of suites for the cruise line onboard Excel Class ships.

These new ships for Carnival feature fun new eateries like Big Chicken at Sea sponsored by basketball legend Shaq O’Neal. In addition Emeril Lagasse has created his first restaurants at sea.

Each ship has its own personality too. On Mardi Gras for instance has a zone themed after New Orleans French Quarter whereas Carnival Celebration has a zone themed after Miami's.

Vista Class

Image

Carnival Vista (2016)

Carnival Horizon (2018)

Carnival Panorama (2019)

Although Excel Class ships now take the cake when it comes to size amenities and design Carnival’s Vista Class ships still have plenty of amenities including several eateries lounges and bars. You can also find an entire top deck filled with attractions and knock-your-socks-off fun.

Although noticeably smaller than Excel Class ships Vista Class ships can hold around 4000 passengers and measure 130000 gross registered tons.

In fact Vista Class ships had their own set of firsts for the cruise industry. Carnival Panorama has the first trampoline park at sea through its partnership with SkyZone. Additionally Carnival Vista and Horizon feature the first IMax theaters at sea.

Image

Although Food Network star Guy Fieri has a fleet-wide partnership with Carnival Cruise Line Vista Class ships featured the first breweries and BBQ smokehouses at sea.

Carnival Panorama and Horizon both include the complimentary Guy’s Pig and Anchor Smokehouse for fall-off-the-bone BBQ. The Smokehouse also offers freshly brewed beer that’s created on-site. Note that this venue is also found onboard Excel Class ships.

Vista Class ships have a wide array of other dining options including Guy’s Burger Joint Italian eatery Cucina Del Capitano JiJi Asian Kitchen BlueIguana Cantina a steakhouse and sushi restaurant.

Image

Suite lovers will also appreciate the ahead-of-its-time suite sections Havana Cabana and Family Harbor while fans of Dr. Seuss will love the themed waterpark on Carnival Horizon.

Venice Class

Image

Carnival Venezia (2023)

Carnival Firenze (2024)

Carnival's Venice Class is part of a collaboration between Carnival and its sister brand Costa Cruises. When you embark on a cruise on either Carnival Venezia or Carnival Firenze you can expect the same Carnival service that you've come to know and love with an Italian flair.

In terms of how they're built both ships are structurally similar to the Vista Class; however because of their Italian flair Carnival decided to categorize them in a different class.

Pizza Dumono onboard Carnival Firenze for instance is the ship's atrium that was inspired by Florence's domed cathedral. And beloved favorites such as Guy's Burger Joint will have exclusive offerings that highlight Costa's Italian heritage. There's even a Mexican-Italian fusion restaurant onboard!

Sunshine Class

Image

Carnival Sunshine (1996/2013)

Carnival Sunrise (1999/2019)

Carnival Radiance (2000/2021)

One of the most unusual classes in Carnival’s fleet is its Sunshine class.

Although these ships are some of the oldest vessels in Carnival’s fleet the cruise line opted to give all 3 ships in the Sunshine class a total makeover. This involved gutting each ship and almost completely rebuilding the vessel costing over $200 million each.

In fact the makeovers were so substantial that Carnival opted to give each cruise ship an entirely new name. Carnival Destiny was renamed Carnival Sunshine. while Carnival Triumph was renamed Carnival Sunrise. Finally Carnival Victory was renamed to Carnival Radiance.

Image

Nearly every area of the ship was redesigned making this a huge overhaul for Carnival. Holding approximately 3000 passengers these vessels are about 40% smaller than Excel Class ships.

Weighing around 100000 gross tons these Sunshine Class ships can’t fit all of the amenities you’ll find on bigger Carnival ships. Interestingly Carnival Sunshine (then Carnival Destiny) was the biggest cruise ship in the world when it debuted in 1996. In fact it was the first cruise ship to weigh more than 100000 gross tons in the cruise industry.

Image

During the renovations the Sunshine Class ships were upgraded to include notably missing Carnival signature amenities like a Serenity adults-only area a full-blown waterpark and a SportsSquare on the top deck that features a basketball court miniature golf and a ropes course.

This also included adding a steakhouse sushi restaurant and Italian Cucina del Capitano onboard.

Dream Class

Image

Carnival Dream (2009)

Carnival Magic (2011)

Carnival Breeze (2012)

Although smaller than Vista Class ships Dream class ships are largely the same and cruisers will find many similarities between the two.

Dream Class ships each hold around 3600 passengers making them slightly smaller than Vista Class ships and have a gross tonnage of around 130000.

Some of the signature amenities that have become popular on Vista Class ships were first launched during the Dream Class Carnival era.

Image

For example Carnival Breeze features a 4D thrill theater. In addition there's a top-deck ropes course on Carnival Dream and Carnival Magic. The fun doesn’t stop there as the top deck also features volleyball miniature golf basketball and a sports court.

Of course no cruise ship is complete without having a pool and Dream Class ships have multiple pools on their top deck.

When it comes to dining Dream Class ships have plenty to choose from both complimentary and specialty. Similar to Vista Class ships Dream Class ships feature complimentary venues like Guy’s Burger Joint and BlueIguana Cantina. For specialty dining a steakhouse and Italian eatery Cucina Del Capitano are available on all three ships.

Splendor Class

Carnival Splendor (2009)

In a class all by itself Carnival Splendor is the only ship in Carnival’s Splendor Class. You are probably wondering why there is only one cruise ship in this class and that’s a great question.

Carnival Splendor was originally built and designed to sail for Carnival’s sister company Costa. Carnival Splendor was meant to be an additional ship in the Costa Concordia class but instead sailed under Carnival in a class of its own. The ship was transferred from Costa to Carnival during the construction phase.

Holding right around 3000 passengers with a gross tonnage of 113000 Carnival Splendor is truly one of a kind!

Even still Carnival Splendor is very similar to ships in the Carnival Conquest class of cruise ships. Built during the same timeframe the biggest difference between Carnival Splendor and the other Conquest class ships is its redesigned top deck. The pool deck on Carnival Splendor has a glass magrodome that can retract which is a notable absence on other Conquest ships.

Carnival Splendor also features a larger spa compared to Conquest ships and a top-deck waterpark that can’t be found on similar sister ships as well.

Carnival Liberty (2005)

Carnival Freedom (2007)

One of the largest classes for Carnival Conquest ships are around 20% smaller than Vista and Dream Class ships. Don’t worry though these smaller Carnival ships still pack plenty of the cruise line’s signature FUN amenities and venues.

Conquest Class ships are considered small to mid-size and especially appeal to Carnival cruisers who don’t want to sail with large crowds of other passengers. The modest size of Conquest class ships allows them to sail to smaller ports as well.

Conquest class ships clock in around 110000 gross tons and can hold around 2900 passengers.

Dining on Conquest Class ships includes fewer choices than bigger and newer Carnival ships but there are still plenty of options onboard. Carnival classics like BlueIguanna Cantina Guy’s Burger Joint Pizza Pirate Carnival Deli and a steakhouse.

In addition to dining options Carnival Conquest class ships feature the Alchemy Bar and RedFrog Rum Bar on the pool deck.

Spirit Class Ships

Carnival Luminosa (2022)

At half the size of Carnival’s new Excel Class ships Spirit Class ships were built to withstand all types of weather meaning these ships aren’t just sailing to the sunny Caribbean.

Spirit Class ships are typically used for far-flung itineraries because of the structural design versatile amenities and ability to dock in smaller ports. With pools that can be covered with retractable glass you can find Spirit Class ships sailing in locations like Alaska where the weather is rarely warm enough for an open-deck swim.

At just 88000 gross tons Spirit Class ships are considered mid-sized vessels that can hold right around 2100 passengers.

Image

Despite their smaller size Carnival has outfitted Spirit Class ships with a surprising number of signature amenities. These cruise ships still have waterslides miniature golf pools and the Serenity adults-only area. Dining options include Guy’s Burger Joint Pizza Pirate and Carnival’s steakhouse.

In 2022 Carnival announced that they would be transferring the Costa Luminosa from sister brand Costa to their own fleet. Built in 2009 Costa Luminosa is slightly bigger than the other ships in its class; however the vessel was built with the same specifications and overall design as the rest of the Spirit Class ships.

Fantasy Class Ships

The oldest and smallest ships in Carnival’s fleet are found in the Fantasy Class. With the implications of COVID-19 in 2020 Carnival has already started to phase out its Fantasy Class ships. Before the pandemic Carnival still had 8 Fantasy Class ships that were still sailing for the cruise line. Now however there are only two.

As the ships were built in the 1990s they are substantially smaller than most cruise ships built today. Weighing 70000 gross tons Fantasy Class ships are designed to sail with 2000 passengers.

Image

Even though Fantasy Class ships are small Carnival has done an excellent job of outfitting the ships with plenty of amenities. You can still find Guy’s Burger Joint Pizza Pirate and Carnival Deli for dining options. The top deck also has the adults-only Serenity area and a waterpark.

Fantasy Class ships really showcase their age when it comes to the number of balconies onboard. Because the ships are so intimately sized and built before balconies were wildly popular for cruisers there are only a limited number of balconies available.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY21pYW1pLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL21pYW1pLWNhcm5pdmFsLW1ha2VzLWJpZy1pbXBhY3Qtb24tc291dGgtZmxvcmlkYXMtZWNvbm9teS8yODc1NjEyL9IBbGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY21pYW1pLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL21pYW1pLWNhcm5pdmFsLW1ha2VzLWJpZy1pbXBhY3Qtb24tc291dGgtZmxvcmlkYXMtZWNvbm9teS8yODc1NjEyLz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Miami Carnival Makes Big Impact on South Florida's Economy,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.nbcmiami.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/local/miami-carnival-makes-big-impact-on-south-floridas-economy/2875612/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC9611360>, 'Connection to www.nbcmiami.com timed out.

While these kitschy souvenirs have previously been given out for all manner of games and competitions they have been noticeably scarce recently.

About the Ship-on-a-Stick

Carnival Cruise Line’s “24-karat plastic ship-on-a-stick” trophies are fun souvenirs throughout the fleet customized with the name of the vessel where the trophy was won. Measuring 5.25 inches (13.25 cm) tall and 6.25 inches (16.0 cm) long the “golden” ship is held aloft by laurel leaves an ancient classic symbol of victory.

Wildly popular as souvenirs of a Fun Ship vacation these trophies are often given out as prizes for trivia contests deck games group games game shows dance offs and all sorts of other onboard competitions. Among Carnival Cruise Line fans collecting a new ship can be the highlight of a cruise.

Trophies Disappearing

In recent weeks however these trophies have seemingly begun to vanish from Carnival ships.

Rather than presenting winners with trophies Fun Squad members have been giving out generic Carnival “bling-on-a-string” medallions for each win reserving the coveted trophies for more intense group competitions or high profile game shows.

This has led to rampant speculation about the fate of the trophies with the most common theory being that the cruise line is eliminating the prizes as a cost-cutting cutback similar to other permanent post-pandemic cutbacks and introducing more fee-based room service options.

Official Response

The rumors have caught the attention of Carnival Cruise Line’s brand ambassador John Heald who has addressed the situation with the ship-on-a-stick trophies on his Facebook page.

“We have not stopped the trophies. I am afraid there was a supply chain issue from the factory” Heald said. “That has been resolved and we should get them back to the ships no later than the end of this month.”

Depending on the ship the supply of trophies may already be nearly exhausted while other ships still have some limited supply of the prizes available to award contest winners.

Who Makes the Trophies?

Carnival Cruise Line has switched manufacturers for the molded plastic trophies in recent years. The original ship-on-a-stick trophies were shinier and had a V-shaped laurel “stick” with stick-on plaques that named the ship.

The newer design is slightly more refined with a matte finish and a more circular laurel leaf holder. Each ship’s name is still on a plaque on the trophy’s base but is now black letters on a gold background rather than the original gold letters on a black background.

Both trophy designs are the same size and the ships on individual trophies are the same not customized to the ship’s class or other details.

Older trophies were manufactured by MDR Industries a division of MDR International Inc. that also created plastic hurricane glasses and other drinkware widely used on cruise ships and in various hotels and resorts.

The new trophies however are manufactured by Y-Not Design & Manufacturing Inc. which also creates other trophy designs and a wide variety of corporate logo products such as drinkware bags electronics stationery and much more.

The new company has partnered with Carnival Cruise Line for nearly a decade providing not only the ship trophies but other loyalty items and branded merchandise.

It appears that the original supplier MDR International Inc. is no longer in operation.

Meanwhile Y-Not Design & Manufacturing Inc. also supplies products to Norwegian Cruise Line and Disney Cruise Line.

Heald referenced a “supply chain issue” as cause for the current trophy shortage which has impacted all aspects of manufacturing and retail operations not just travel industry souvenirs.

To allay fears of discontinuing the trophies however Heald emphasized that the prizes will return.

“They will be back and will return to being prizes again” he said.

That will be good news to Carnival Cruise Line fans looking forward to continuing to collect these whimsical trophies especially with Carnival Celebration soon to join the fleet – what better way to celebrate the new ship than winning a new trophy?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9tYW4tYXJyZXN0ZWQtYWxsZWdlZGx5LWtpc3NpbmctNS15ZWFyLW9sZC1naXJsLWNydWlzZS1zaGlwLTE3NDkwNzHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cruise Ship Passenger Caught Kissing 5-Year-Old Girl on Board Police Say,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9tYW4tYXJyZXN0ZWQtYWxsZWdlZGx5LWtpc3NpbmctNS15ZWFyLW9sZC1naXJsLWNydWlzZS1zaGlwLTE3NDkwNzHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC96108E0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9tYW4tYXJyZXN0ZWQtYWxsZWdlZGx5LWtpc3NpbmctNS15ZWFyLW9sZC1naXJsLWNydWlzZS1zaGlwLTE3NDkwNzHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Ford Deploys After One-Day Weather Delay,"The Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78) departs Naval Station Norfolk Oct. 4. U.S. NAVY / Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Anderson W. Branch

ARLINGTON Va. — The lead ship U.S. Navy’s newest class of nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Gerald Ford (CVN 78) delayed a day for weather departed Naval Station Norfolk Virginia Oct. 4 on its first major deployment.

“This afternoon the Navy’s newest and most advanced aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78) set out on deployment” said Lt. Danielle Moser deputy public affairs officer for Commander U.S. 2nd Fleet in an Oct. 4 release.

The Ford is making what the Navy calls a “service-retained” deployment meaning it is operating by the authority of the chief of naval operations under command and control of the U.S. 2nd Fleet rather than under the command and control of a regional combatant commander under the Global Force Management Concept.

Vice Adm. Daniel Dwyer commander of the U.S. 2nd Fleet said Carrier Strike Group 12 (CSG 12) of which the Ford is a part will range throughout the Atlantic Ocean operating with navies of allied and partner nations.

Dwyer speaking to reporters Sept. 26 said the deployment would provide the Ford CSG commander “a chance to test the carrier’s air operability prior to embarking on its first Global Force Management deployment next year. This historic service-retained deployment is an opportunity for the U.S. Navy to come together with other members of the NATO Alliance to exercise and train together within the Atlantic and its littorals while testing out advanced technologies on the first new class of U.S. aircraft carrier in more than 40 years.”

CSG-12 and Destroyer Squadron Two staffs will be embarked in the Ford as will Carrier Air Wing Eight. Deploying with the group will be Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser USS Normandy (CG 60); the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers USS Ramage (DDG 61) USS McFaul (DDG 74) and USS Thomas Hudner (DDG 116); the Legend-class national security cutter USCGC Hamilton (WMSL 753); the Henry J. Kaiser-class fleet replenishment oiler USNS Joshua Humphpries (T-AO 188) and the Lewis and Clark-class dry cargo and ammunition ship USNS Robert E. Peary (T-AKE 5).

Units from eight allied and partner nations will operate with the CSG and include ships from Canada Denmark Finland France Germany The Netherlands Spain and Sweden. The CSG includes 17 ships and one submarine.

While deployed the Ford CSG will conduct group steaming air-defense exercises maritime domain awareness long-range maritime strike distributed maritime operations antisubmarine warfare exercises and naval integration Dwyer said.

All eight squadrons of Carrier Air Wing Eight will be onboard for the deployment but some will not be at full strength in terms of numbers of aircraft.

“It won’t be the full complement but it will be nearly the entire air wing” Dwyer said. “And that is not because of any lack of capacity aboard Ford but only where the air wing is in the Global Force Management process. We’re still sizing the numbers but it will be a fairly full air wing but not the complete air wing.”

New Technology

The Ford commissioned in 2017 is deploying with 43 new technologies including the Electro-Magnetic Aircraft Launch System and the Advanced Arresting Gear.

The Ford’s commanding officer Capt. Paul Lanzilotta said in a Sept. 29 interview that all systems have been tested and are ready to go and some will go through further operational testing.

Lanzilotta a native of Long Island New York is an E-2 Hawkeye naval flight officer. He said the Ford has “incredible network connectivity.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL2NoaW5hLXNlbmRzLWNoaWxsaW5nLXdhcm5pbmctdG8taW5kaWEtc2F5cy1vdXItY2Fycmllci1iYXR0bGUtZ3JvdXAv0gFiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXVyYXNpYW50aW1lcy5jb20vY2hpbmEtc2VuZHMtY2hpbGxpbmctd2FybmluZy10by1pbmRpYS1zYXlzLW91ci1jYXJyaWVyLWJhdHRsZS1ncm91cC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China Sends ‘Chilling Warning’ To India Says ‘Our Carrier Battle Group Would Be Sailing In IOR Very Soon’,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL2NoaW5hLXNlbmRzLWNoaWxsaW5nLXdhcm5pbmctdG8taW5kaWEtc2F5cy1vdXItY2Fycmllci1iYXR0bGUtZ3JvdXAv0gFiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXVyYXNpYW50aW1lcy5jb20vY2hpbmEtc2VuZHMtY2hpbGxpbmctd2FybmluZy10by1pbmRpYS1zYXlzLW91ci1jYXJyaWVyLWJhdHRsZS1ncm91cC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018ECA309240>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL2NoaW5hLXNlbmRzLWNoaWxsaW5nLXdhcm5pbmctdG8taW5kaWEtc2F5cy1vdXItY2Fycmllci1iYXR0bGUtZ3JvdXAv0gFiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXVyYXNpYW50aW1lcy5jb20vY2hpbmEtc2VuZHMtY2hpbGxpbmctd2FybmluZy10by1pbmRpYS1zYXlzLW91ci1jYXJyaWVyLWJhdHRsZS1ncm91cC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmpvYy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9yb3JvLXN1cmdlLWRyaXZpbmctbmV3LWludmVzdG1lbnQtY2FycmllcnNfMjAyMjEwMDUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ro/ro surge driving new investment by carriers,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmpvYy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9yb3JvLXN1cmdlLWRyaXZpbmctbmV3LWludmVzdG1lbnQtY2FycmllcnNfMjAyMjEwMDUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018ECA30A3B0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmpvYy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9yb3JvLXN1cmdlLWRyaXZpbmctbmV3LWludmVzdG1lbnQtY2FycmllcnNfMjAyMjEwMDUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL2lvdGJ1c2luZXNzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8wNC84MDc3NS10bnMtbGF1bmNoZXMtc21hcnQtc2ltLWNhcGFiaWxpdHktZm9yLWdsb2JhbC13aXJlbGVzcy1hY2Nlc3MtaW4tbm9ydGgtYW1lcmljYS1leHRlbmRzLWdsb2JhbC1zaW0tY2FwYWJpbGl0eS10by11cy1jdXN0b21lcnMv0gGtAWh0dHBzOi8vaW90YnVzaW5lc3NuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEwLzA0LzgwNzc1LXRucy1sYXVuY2hlcy1zbWFydC1zaW0tY2FwYWJpbGl0eS1mb3ItZ2xvYmFsLXdpcmVsZXNzLWFjY2Vzcy1pbi1ub3J0aC1hbWVyaWNhLWV4dGVuZHMtZ2xvYmFsLXNpbS1jYXBhYmlsaXR5LXRvLXVzLWN1c3RvbWVycy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TNS Launches Smart SIM Capability for Global Wireless Access in North America; Extends Global SIM Capabilit...,"Managed Mission-critical Multi-Carrier Connectivity Through One SIM Card.

The Indian carrier has developed its own 5G hardware and software solution which includes a 5G radio a 5G core network and cloud-native operation support system (OSS) platforms.

Reliance Jio is in talks with global operators over supplying its locally-developed 5G kit outside of India.

“We are in serious discussions with some global operators” said an executive with knowledge of the matter to the ET.

The source adds that Jio's 5G stack is already being successfully used at its Jio Campus plus other Reliance Industries offices. Jio is planning to utilize this end-to-end solution in rolling out its 5G network in India.

Jio has lofty ambitions with its 5G roll-out with the operator confirming it will invest $25 billion to deploy its Standalone 5G network across the country by the end of 2023. The operator wants to provide its 5G service to more than 1000 cities across the country according to its chairman Mukesh Ambani.

Jio's 5G push follows its acquisition of $11 billion of spectrum in the 900MHz 3500MHz and 26GHz bands in August.

The company's commercial roll-out of 5g services in India will be supported by kit from Ericsson Nokia and Samsung as well as its own solution confirms the executive.

Unlike other operators in India Jio is the only operator that is deploying its 5G networks out on a Standalone (SA) mode with rival operators such as Bharti Airtel opting for Non-Standalone (NSA) which makes use of existing 4G infrastructure such as mid-band spectrum (1800MHz and 2100MHz) while the 3300MHz spectrum enables for 5G speeds.

Bharti spent $5.4bn on the spectrum in the 900MHz 1800MHz 2100MHz 3300MHz and 26GHz bands while Vodafone Idea spent $2.4bn on the 3300MHz and 26GHz spectrum bands in a few targeted circles.

India's home-grown 5G push

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi officially launched 5G services in India on October 1 2022. The Indian government expects to achieve a nationwide rollout of 5G coverage by 2024.

The Indian government recently announced its intentions to restrict the role foreign telcos play in building the country's 4G and 5G networks.

Only Indian telecoms vendors will be allowed to work on state-owned telco's BSNL and MTNL's 4G and 5G projects as the country wants to reduce dependence on international providers.

Non-state-owned providers including Reliance and Bharti Airtel face restrictions around using Huawei and ZTE hardware in their networks; the Chinese vendors were not included in 5G trials last year. Cisco has previously said it was removing Chinese hardware from its networks in India.

Reliance Jio's parent company Reliance Industries is also looking to develop networking equipment in the country and has signed a joint venture with Sanmina in an attempt to create a high-tech manufacturing hub in the country in line with Modi's ""Make in India"" vision.

During its recent Executive Sustainability Forum Caterpillar announced it will unveil four new prototype battery electric machines several of which will be on display at the world’s largest construction trade show held later this month.

Models include the 320 medium electric excavator the 950 GC medium electric wheel loader the 301.9 electric compact excavator and the 906 electric compact wheel loader.

Earlier this year Volvo Construction Equipment also announced it was testing an electric version of its 24-ton EC320 excavator.

Caterpillar Cat says it is leveraging its experience with gensets locomotives and large mining machines as it brings alternative power solutions to construction equipment. The Caterpillar-designed 48-volt 300-volt and 600-volt lithium-ion batteries in the machines will feature a modular design that offers flexible configuration across multiple applications including the potential to reuse and recycle at the end of life.

“When we develop these products we want to make sure that customers do not experience any performance difference on the battery electric or diesel-powered machine” Corné Timmermans vice president sales and marketing Europe Africa Middle East and Eurasia told event attendees.

The 320 Electric excavator will be powered by a Cat 600-volt 256 kWh battery with a runtime of up to eight hours on a single charge.

Caterpillar The 950 GC will feature Cat 600 volt 320kWh battery and will be capable of operating up to six hours on a single charge.

Caterpillar Capable of running up to eight hours on a single charge or up to four to five hours of continuous trenching the 301.9 Electric mini excavator will be powered by a Cat 48 volt 32kWh battery.

And the 906 electric compact wheel loader will be equipped with a Cat 300-volt 64 kWh battery that enables the operator to work up to six hours on a single charge.

According to Cat runtimes for the battery-powered machines are based on average moderate applications. Each machine will include an onboard AC charger which is best for overnight charging. A DC fast-charging option will also be available for charging during breaks.

“The runtime is influenced by a number of different factors” says Timmermans. “It could be the type of application the temperature in the environment the load factor the ground conditions operator techniques and much more.”

In analyzing its telematics data Cat says the battery life is sufficient based on the average daily usage of its machines.

The 301.9 and 906 will be the first machines commercially available units in Europe and North America with the 950 GC and 320 to follow in the coming years.

No single solution

The company acknowledged that electric-powered equipment will be one of many solutions needed to help customers reach their sustainability goals. Hydrogen is also part of that equation.

“We might not have the energy density needed in a battery electric product today. In some cases hydrogen could be a great alternative” said Senior Vice President Rod Shurman.

“The thing we’re really watching to see develop is hydrogen becomes available in a renewable green source – a sustainable cost-effective way to get that to our customers to go with the products that we already have today that are hydrogen-capable.”

When it comes to adoption and cost customers have expressed their share of qualms about alternatively powered equipment compared to their diesel counterparts which Caterpillar also addressed during the event.

“There are so many factors to consider. The biggest components are going to be how the cost of batteries evolves and how the life expectancy of batteries evolves with time” said Senior Vice President Jason Conklin. “Also a big challenge for customers is how to get this much energy to their site. That energy infrastructure becomes a critical piece as well.”

Conklin outlined three primary drivers for the adoption of higher-cost alternatively powered machines: meeting internal sustainability goals meeting local regulations and jobsite application.

“What’s important for our customers to understand is Caterpillar is not going to pick one winner and one solution” Conklin says. “We’re going to be working on the total cost of ownership and lowering the greenhouse gas emissions of our current product offering today the battery electric machines that we talked about and of course the future possibility of hydrogen fuel cells. The total cost of ownership will shift with time and we’ll be ready for that.”

Cat has committed to 100% of its new products through 2030 being more sustainable than the previous generation.

At Bauma Cat will be represented by its German dealer Zeppelin. The company will feature more than 70 pieces of Cat equipment and attachments at stand 336 in Hall A4.

As IT leaders at financial services institutions consider cloud services it’s important that they understand what distinguishes private cloud technology from public cloud. Private cloud devotes computing resources to a single entity. An organization can host a private cloud at its own onsite data center or the cloud can be hosted by a third-party service provider. In this model the hardware and software are dedicated to a single organization and infrastructure is maintained on a private network — completely controlled by a single organization and not shared with others. By contrast a public cloud setup is supported by infrastructure that may be shared by multiple organizations. The hardware software and infrastructure of a public cloud are owned and managed by the cloud provider.

Users access data stored within a private cloud via a private connection such as a VPN while public cloud assets can be accessed directly through the internet. The VPN provides financial institutions with an extra layer of security to protect sensitive data and helps meet regulatory and governance standards.

Financial institutions may also benefit from the cost structure offered by a private cloud. Organizations generally pay for public cloud services on a subscription basis which costs more as they use more resources while a private cloud model establishes a fixed cost that firms can budget for.

DIG DEEPER: Discover steps banks can take to safely migrate to the cloud.

Financial services organizations that want the benefits of private cloud but don’t want to build out the on-premises infrastructure to support it may elect to use a managed private cloud. In this approach a third-party service provider manages and maintains the infrastructure in a single-tenant environment. This model can be expensive but it provides significant benefits with security and customization.

CDW can help financial services organizations gauge where they are in their digital transformation journey. We can discuss whether cloud technologies might meet their needs and explore options regarding public or private cloud models. It’s important to keep in mind that not all private clouds are created equal. Our experts can help organizations determine which offerings best meet their needs and help them set a plan of action as they explore cloud technologies.

“We are going to fight it” Kenneth Burgess a homeowner said. “You don’t want to have 300000 gallons of liquid propane near your residential area.”

CenterPoint Energy has plans to install a natural gas pipeline behind the homes on River Bluff Drive.

“They told people that this is safe because nothing happened yet” Burgess said. “But nothing happened at my plant before the explosion occurred.”

On October 23 1989 Burgess worked at Chevron Phillips in Pasadena.

“Twenty-three of my co-workers died in that explosion” he recalled. “When the alarm went off we looked around and all we saw was a huge plume of gas.”

KPRC 2 reached out to CenterPoint Energy and they said the pipeline is designed to bring operational benefits.

They also said in a statement the project is expected to improve the interconnectivity between existing supply points and meet the needs of customers. They wouldn’t provide additional details on their specific safety plans and approval process.

“What happens if there is a leak?” asked homeowner Angela King. “What’s the timeline or the time frame for the emergency department to even respond?”

Some neighbors say CenterPoint Energy has tried offering them money.

“They’re saying if they don’t respond they’re going to take it by eminent domain” King said.

Fueling frustrations—other homeowners say they’re just now hearing about the plan.

The injectable-drug maker is extending its footprint in the Fulton Market District strengthening the neighborhood’s reputation as a biotech hub Crain’s reported. Xeris’ move also marks another departure from LaSalle Street through the Loop a corridor that’s been struggling to retain office tenants since even before the pandemic.

Xeris signed a 13-year lease for 87000 square feet at 1375 West Fulton Street. The new lease is an expansion for the company which previously leased 40000 square feet at 180 North LaSalle Street and 11000 square feet in the Fulton Street building.

With the deal Xeris becomes the anchor tenant of the 14-story Trammel Crow-developed building that includes lab space for multiple life sciences companies including Vanqua Bio Talis Biomedical and Charles River Laboratories.

Xeris CEO Paul Edick said the company was eager to consolidate its footprint into one of the buildings it already occupied. Kyle Kamin of CBRE negotiated the new lease on behalf of Xeris while Kelsey Scheive also of CBRE represented the landlord.

The expanded lease is positive news for Chicago which historically has lost growing pharmaceutical companies like Xeris to other more mature life sciences markets such as Boston or San Francisco. Developers have worked to address the main problem which is a lack of high-quality and well-located lab space by including that kind of space in more properties near the heart of the city.

The firm will list the 40000 square feet it occupied at 190 North LaSalle on the sublease market adding to a record amount of downtown secondary space already available.

Trammell Crow built the 14-floor 301000-square-foot 1375 West Fulton as the first phase of its Fulton Labs project and earlier this year completed the second at 400 North Aberdeen Street a 16-story 420000-square-foot project.

Before Google finalized its purchase of the Thompson Center in the Loop the tech company was reportedly considering expanding its Fulton Market presence by up to 200000 square feet at the Aberdeen building but later dropped that option. readmore title=”Read more”]

My theory at the time was that because Jones is so dependent on his unique shall we say personal charisma for the effectiveness of his message any attempt to spell out his theory in writing would expose how little sense his actual worldview makes.

I confess that I was a little surprised then to look at the Wall Street Journal’s list of Nonfiction Bestsellers this month and find on it a new book credited to one Mr. Alex Jones: The Great Reset: And The War For The World. It has not as far as I can tell been reviewed by any mainstream outlet but if the Journal is accurate it is selling briskly. It comes with blurbs from Joe Rogan Tucker Carlson Donald Trump and Steve Bannon as well as from Dr. Mercola “founder of Mercola.com the most visited natural health site on the internet for the last twenty years.” (Mercola has repeatedly been in trouble with the FDA and FTC for making false claims about the products he sells and the New York Times calls him the country’s leading purveyor of coronavirus misinformation.) Mercola says that Jones’ book does “an excellent job of bringing the globalists’ plans into the light.”

Indeed The Great Reset finds Jones banging the same drum as usual: a conspiracy of “globalists” is attempting to seize control of the world and establish a repressive totalitarian state.1 The conspiratorially-minded often make strange choices in deciding who the world’s leading villains are (George Soros for example) seemingly selecting some wealthy plutocrat at random to cast as the leading plotter. In The Great Reset Jones’ nemesis is Klaus Schwab founder of the World Economic Forum that meets annually at Davos. Schwab has written some very boring books on global economic trends and Jones spends many pages presenting extracts from them as if they are diabolical manifestos for creating the new world order.

The result is amusing. When the Financial Times reviewed Schwab’s book Shaping The Future of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in 2018 the reviewer found the book so dull and platitudinous that they wondered whether it could really have been written by a human being. It’s a TED Talk of a book about how “the world is at a crossroads” making the point that new technologies seem like they might change society a lot. It’s full of sentences like “considering the economic pressures can also highlight where incentives problematise an entire class of technologies.”

For Jones however Schwab’s writings are a blueprint for a world takeover. Schwab writes that we are “witnessing profound shifts across all industries marked by the emergence of new business models the disruption of incumbents and the reshaping of production consumption transportation and delivery systems.” Jones comments that this is full of “subtle calls to increase control over your life.” When Schwab writes that “governments and institutions are being reshaped as are systems of education healthcare and transportation” Jones says that when “translated” the sentence means “they just want to control the schools the medical system and your freedom of movement.” Or consider this passage from Schwab:

“The Fourth Industrial Revolution is a new chapter in human development driven by the increasing availability and interaction of a set of extraordinary technologies building on three previous technological revolutions. This revolution is only in its early stages which provides humankind with the opportunity and responsibility to shape not just the design of new technologies but also more agile forms of governance and positive values that will fundamentally change how we live work and relate to each other.”

Jones comments:

“What are these ‘more agile forms of governance’? A summary execution by firing squad without the benefit of a trial? Maybe the continued illegal detention of January 6 2021 protestors many of whom languish in jails more than a year after the event who have been denied a speedy trial?”

Jones promises to go through “all parts of Schwab’s strategy to use the Great Reset to achieve an unprecedented amount of control over your daily life” and expose that we are in a “war to control the future of human development and capture control of the human species.”

That means page after page in which Jones will quote Klaus Schwab saying something banal about “empowering stakeholders” and Jones will comment that “whenever you hear the word ‘stakeholder’ you should think of it as a weapon Schwab and company will use to deprive a person of their rights.” (Jones takes meaningless corporate buzzwords more seriously than anyone else does.) Jones quotes Schwab saying:

“The pandemic struck at a time when many different issues ranging from climate change activism and rising inequalities to gender diversity and #MeToo scandals had already begun to raise awareness and heighten the criticality of stakeholder capitalism and ESG [environmental social and governance] considerations in today’s interdependent world. … [N]obody can deny that companies’ fundamental purpose can no longer be simply the unbridled pursuit of financial profit; it is now incumbent upon them to serve all their stakeholders not only those who hold shares.”

Jones says this passage proves the globalists use climate change and inequality to scare people into letting the globalists take charge:

“Remember when I said that the globalists will use any issue to promote their plans? There’s COVID-19 climate change inequality gender diversity and now the #MeToo movement all part of the globalist plan to create maximum chaos and fear the better to implement their authoritarian agenda. The issue really doesn’t matter because the answer is always the same: globalism.”

You can see that the evidence Jones uses to support the existence of the globalist conspiracy is to put it mildly thin. He presents empty platitudes as smoking gun evidence. I do think I was correct to believe that because Jones relies so heavily on the theory that if you just shout your opinion loud enough people won’t be able to respond the attempt to lay out his ideas in writing was doomed to fail. You can see when you pick up The Great Reset that Jones’ belief in a globalist conspiracy depends on fanciful creative interpretations of banal texts.

And yet: it is also important to remember why Jones succeeds at drawing in large numbers of people. Frequently there is some kernel of truth in what Jones is saying. For instance Jones portrays the wealthy and well-connected people who show up at the Davos conferences as a nefarious elite bent on world domination. They’re not that exactly but they are interested in preserving the wealth and privileges of the global 1 percent. The “great reset” of Jones’ title is a real initiative put forth by the World Economic Forum and when you look beneath the buzzwords it’s indeed very fishy. Ivan Wecke of OpenDemocracy notes that while the WEF’s “stakeholder capitalism” plans might not have the “malicious intent” that people like Jones posit they do foresee a world in which giant global mega-corporations have an outsized role in policy. Wecke notes that when people like Jones talk about the WEF’s “great reset” proposal they characterize it as something like “the global elite’s plan to instate a communist world order by abolishing private property while using COVID-19 to solve overpopulation and enslaving what remains of humanity with vaccines.” (Indeed Jones writes in The Great Reset that he believes the “most likely scenario” was that COVID-19 was “released on purpose by the globalists to terrify us into accepting their authoritarian rule complete with dangerous vaccines that would kill or maim a large part of the population requiring further government support.”) But Wecke shows that when the WEF talks of “multi-stakeholder inclusivity” it appears to mean giving corporations a greater say on issues that are—and should be—decided by the UN and democratically-elected governments.

Time and time again Jones hits on issues where he almost has a point but then definitely doesn’t. He sees the Trilateral Commission and the late Zbigniew Brzezinski as major villains in the plotting of a technocratic world government. Not exactly but they certainly haven’t been reliable allies of authentic democracy. Jones says that the term “public-private partnership” can be understood to mean “fascism.” Not quite but you should be suspicious of the term because it can mean handing control of public assets to unaccountable corporations. Jones spends an entire chapter attacking Yuval Noah Harari as a promoter of the new world order and while Hari might not quite be that he is an overpraised thinker whose work does help to rationalize Silicon Valley’s worst and most anti-democratic ideas. Jones discusses the risks that artificial intelligence poses in enabling governments to track and oppress their citizens asking us to “imagine a world where your every movement is tracked. Your opinions would be analyzed by artificial intelligence (AI) and you could be instantly penalized for wrong thinking.” He seems to be envisaging a world where people who question vaccines are “penalized” but the more likely outcome (at least in the United States) is that police and prosecutors will be furnished with new tools that help maintain our brutal system of mass incarceration.

Jones raises concerns about central bank digital currencies warning that they would give governments the ability to more easily impose financial penalties on dissidents. That’s not a totally unreasonable worry. But Jones as usual takes an issue where he might have a point into the loopiest territory imaginable. He sees a plan to integrate people’s bank accounts with systems that track their vaccination status and carbon footprint as part of the “world ID surveillance system.” He cites a Ukrainian government initiative to “put the state in a smartphone” that would have allowed people to more easily access government services and benefits online and suggests that Putin invaded Ukraine to stop it from building its totalitarian app:

“You’re talking about a centralized system totally controlled by the government that not only tracks and knows everything about you but can freeze your account as it sees fit! Not only that but these Ukrainian Digital ID services will also feature vaccination electronic passports and Ukrainian Covid Certificates. Ukraine was pioneering a system that governments all around the world could use as a template to control their populations. If we look at the Russian invasion of Ukraine with that perspective do Putin’s actions seem as difficult to understand?”

As I say Jones can begin with an observation that might if further developed by someone with greater regard for evidence form the basis of a valuable point. Other times however he just comes up with weird nonsense as with his idea that efforts to stop climate change by rolling back fossil fuel use are part of a plan to “destroy everything” and create “global corporate government”:

“The plan is simple: destroy the fossil fuel industry send prices soaring manufacture an energy crisis blame fossil fuels and shut down reliable global energy without a viable immediate alternative. This is what the Great Reset is all about. If you want a global corporate government that rules over humanity you have to destroy everything first.”



Yes in the Jones conception of the world corporations hate fossil fuels. Meanwhile here in the real world the battle to shut down fossil fuel use is a battle against the “corporate government.”

One would hope that at this point not many people take Alex Jones seriously. The Sandy Hook cases have exposed that he is a serial liar who cruelly attacked traumatized parents and caused them to have to live in fear of his deranged followers. Sadly the fact that his new book is a bestseller shows that there is at least some audience for his theories and it’s alarming to look at for example the comments section on his Joe Rogan appearance and see how many people concluded that Jones made a fair amount of sense.

“I want you to see all of this as part of a plan.” — Alex Jones

The tragedy is that the people who listen to Jones sense there is something deeply wrong and unjust about the world and they turn to him to explain to them what it is. And instead of telling them the banal truth about the way that people with status and wealth maintain that status and wealth he weaves them a fantastical tale about Klaus Schwab giving them COVID in order to sow chaos. Jones terrifies them and leads them astray correctly telling them that the Davos elite are up to no good but then directing their ire against such targets as grieving Sandy Hook parents.

I actually think we should be careful before dismissing “conspiracy theories.” Some conspiracies are true after all and an explanation isn’t insane just because it posits that a small group of people did something without telling the public. But Jones’ book shows where paranoia can take you and why skepticism and critical thinking are crucial if we are to maintain our ties with reality. You can end up seeing issues of major concern to the public such as fossil fuel use vaccination and overuse of technology as all being manipulated in part of some Big Plan. In fact most of the issues we face are just different aspects of the same old unjust mess that no one person landed us in. Klaus Schwab seems like a neoliberal but he is not a supervillain. The world doesn’t have supervillains though it has a lot of greed and cruelty. The task of an intelligent person is to try to understand how it all works without drifting into madness. Want to understand corporate power? Look to Ralph Nader or read Dollars and Sense magazine. Want to understand pharmaceutical greed and profiteering in healthcare? Read Empire of Pain about the Sackler family and follow the writings of Dr. Abdul El-Sayed. There are plenty of sources for dissenting views that are critical of elites but deeply concerned with factual accuracy.

The Great Reset is a useful cautionary tale showing how far from reality it is possible to end up.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiuwFodHRwczovL3JpYWJpei5jb20vYS8yMDIyLzEwLzQvcGVyc2hpbmctd2lucy0yNy1iaWxsaW9uLXN0ZXdhcmQtcGFydG5lcnMtcmlhLWN1c3RvZHktYWNjb3VudC1hZnRlci1nb2xkbWFuLXNhY2hzLWJvb3RzLWxhdW5jaC1hbmQtcHJlc3N1cmUtYnVpbHQtZm9yLWFuLWFsdGVybmF0aXZlLXRvLWppbHRlZC1yYXltb25kLWphbWVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pershing wins $27-billion Steward Partners RIA custody account after Goldman Sachs boots launch and pressure built ...,Farther struts its startup magic and shows why a $375-million RIA can be worth $50 million -- by getting four advisors to bring books of business just to be part of the enterprise,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy90b3AtNS1zdG9ja3MtMjAyMy0xOTUwMjI2MDQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 5 Stocks for 2023,"John Jagerson here.

Welcome to Trading Opportunities! We’re glad to have you here.

If you haven’t been a part of our services before Wade and I are both Chartered Market Technician (CMT) designees and have been focused on educating investors for most of our careers.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Together we’ve co-founded several educational platforms services and this Trading Opportunities free e-letter.

As we hope to leave one of the most contentious and turbulent trading years in recent history behind we want to focus on which stocks we believe will generate you reliable steady income in the years ahead.

The one positive aspect of a bear market is that valuations are low. As long as traders can focus on the underlying fundamentals and maintain a long-term view bargains during a bear market can be very profitable.

In my and Wade’s view the best stocks right now are positioned to take advantage of the economy’s problems namely inflation rising interest rates and slowing growth. Or at least the best stocks are those that are most insulated from the problems in the economy.

In this report we aren’t chasing fast-moving high-risk plays with little reward. Rather we’re zeroing in on the slow-and-steady growers that will reinforce your portfolio.

With that I’d like to give you a list of our top stocks for the rest of this year – and into 2023…

2023 Stock No. 1: AutoZone Inc.

Recently I was shopping for a new car and decided on the Ford Maverick. I was anxious to get started because I knew there would be an order process to wade through. However when I finally called the dealer I was informed that demand is so high and supplies were so low I would not even be able to place an order.

With rising auto costs a potential economic slowdown and low supply there are plenty of folks in my situation. I will just have to wait if I don’t want to pay more than MSRP on the secondary market. In the meantime I will do what millions of other Americans will do: “Fix it up wear it out make it do or do without.”

The bottom line is that auto supplies repairs and equipment will continue to be in demand.

We like AutoZone Inc. (AZO) as a way to take advantage of the problems automakers (and their customers) are dealing with. We think being an AZO buyer on the dips is a profit opportunity until automaker supply constraints start to loosen.

2023 Stock No. 2: The Charles Schwab Corp.

Did you know your broker makes money from you in more ways than commissions? They aren’t always so forthcoming about the revenues they extract from you but in most cases these revenue streams are tied to interest rates.

Story continues

As rates rise it positively affects net margins driving profits higher. Payment for order flow margin interest and share lending are examples of how brokerages like Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) can stay in business despite charging no commissions.

For example if you have a margin account your broker can “borrow” your shares and lend them to short-sellers. They don’t pay you anything for that access but they charge interest on the margin used by the short-seller to hold their position. The higher rates rise the larger the margin is for brokers.

While all those income strategies are bad for a broker’s customers they are good for a broker’s shareholders. In that sector we like The Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW) which we know looks like a bit of a dog right now but that is normal for bear markets.

If interest rates remain high and market conditions stabilize (or dare we hope improve…?) then SCHW should see a big move higher. Schwab has been acquiring customers through acquisitions which gives them the scale to amplify their profits once the market starts to settle and trading balances rise again.

2023 Stock No. 3: Costco Wholesale Corp.

A rising dollar is a big problem for large caps – especially technology companies because the profits they earn outside the United States are converted back into fewer stronger dollars. However what if a large percentage of your revenue comes from imported products that are cheaper in stronger dollar terms?

A strong dollar is why we still like the discount-retail space. We think that fears about consumer spending have been overblown. As long as hiring remains positive spending should continue to rise which means retail firms are in a position to benefit from a strong dollar.

Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST)‘s fundamentals look good and the issues squeezing margins should be offset in the short-term with the company’s advantages due to a strong dollar. We think buying this deeply-discounted deep-discounter on the dips makes sense.

2023 Stock No. 4: Starbucks Corp.

Retail services stocks aren’t immune from inflation problems but some companies have strategies to deal with it.

For example Starbucks frequently deals with inflation-deflation cycles in their raw materials (coffee beans). From the bottom of the pandemic bear market to the top at the end of 2021 coffee prices rose 100% while Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) shares rallied 89%.

General inflation is more complicated for SBUX to deal with than just rising coffee prices. Still the point is that the firm is already good at making adjustments to maintain price stability. That’s why we expect SBUX to stay off its lows and rally in the short-term while consumer spending remains strong.

2023 Stock No. 5: Waste Management Inc.

It usually makes sense in a volatile market to focus on defensive dividend-paying stocks. That is still true now but because interest rates and inflation are rising traditional dividend strategies don’t work as well. Future dividends are worth less when interest rates rise because the present value of those income streams is lower.

However if a company has a defensible near-monopoly on their customer base positive margin trends and historically has raised its dividend above inflation rates then the old rules can still apply in an inflationary market. Waste Management is precisely that kind of company.

Waste Management Inc. (WM)‘s efforts to harvest energy and byproducts from trash collection and landfills are just two examples of how the company is working to increase cash flows to keep its dividend payout ratio high and the yield ahead of inflation. As the pool of dividend stocks shrinks we expect value investors to flow into the company’s shares in the short term.

Fidelity already has $5 million invested in a new Ethereum index fund according to registration documents filed today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The asset manager which has $4.5 trillion on its books registered its Fidelity Ethereum Index Fund on Tuesday but said in its SEC filing that the first sale took place on September 26.

Last month Fidelity was rumored to be considering offering Bitcoin trading to its more than 34 million retail customers although the news didn’t come from Fidelity directly. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz spilled the beans at New York’s SALT forum.

“A bird told me a little bird in my ear told me Fidelity is going to shift its retail customers into crypto soon enough” he said at the event. “I hope that bird is right.”

Fidelity has also been busy working on a crypto exchange EDX Markets. The company teamed up with Charles Schwab Citadel Securities and other backers to form a consortium in hopes that the new exchange will “facilitate a more efficient secure and cost-effective process for trading digital assets” a Fidelity spokesperson told Decrypt in an email last month.

The new Fidelity Ethereum Index Fund enters an increasingly crowded field with other prominent Ethereum funds.

As recently as September asset manager Bitwise—with $1 billion under its belt—said in an SEC filing that its Ethereum Fund had $25 million worth of assets under management. Bitwise’s Ethereum index fund has been around a lot longer launched by the San Francisco company in 2018.

The main difference between index funds like Fidelity and Bitwise’s and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) is how they’re traded. Index funds like Fidelity’s new offering can only be purchased after markets have closed and at set rates.

ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the day like stocks. There’s also the matter of the minimum investment required to participate.

Index funds tend to have a higher minimum although the $50000 minimum on the new Fidelity fund and $25000 minimum at ETHE and Bitwise put them largely out of range for retail investors especially since all of these Ethereum funds are also limited to accredited investors."
CHTR,Charter Communications,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZ2h0cmVhZGluZy5jb20vNWcvY2hhcnRlci12ZXJpem9uLXBsZWRnZS10by1zeW5jaHJvbml6ZS10aGVpci01Zy1uZXR3b3Jrc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Charter Verizon pledge to synchronize their 5G networks,"Mobile provider Verizon and cable company Charter Communications told the FCC they plan to synchronize the operation of their respective 5G networks to avoid interference.

""As the commission is aware interference between midband spectrum operations caused by a failure to synchronize TDD [time-division duplexing] systems will undermine the quality and reliability of existing and promised 5G services"" the companies wrote in a new filing to the FCC. ""By this letter the companies seek to streamline voluntary coordination among TDD operators to reduce risks of harmful interference and accelerate the deployment of 5G service and cutting-edge wireless technologies across midband spectrum. We believe these efforts will help to advance the commission's goal of achieving the highest and best use of spectrum resources.""

In their filing the companies also provided the technological minutiae of their plans. For example they plan to use UTC as their common reference phase clock and their ""frame"" will be 5 milliseconds (ms) long and consist of in sequence 1.714 ms of downlink transmissions.

Figure 1: (Source: Kristoffer Tripplaar/Alamy Stock Photo)

""This default configuration will be applied across the companies' networks that provide outdoor wireless coverage and is consistent with the default parameters recommended by Global System for Global Communications Association (GSMA) and global usage patterns"" the companies noted in their filing.

They didn't provide further details but it's possible their work involves technological synchronization between Verizon's C-band 5G network and Charter's planned 3.5GHz CBRS 5G network.

Beyond an MVNO

The joint filing is noteworthy for several reasons. Most importantly it appears to signal Charter's plans to launch a 5G network with the $464 million worth of 3.5GHz CBRS spectrum the company purchased in an FCC auction in 2020. Charter executives have long been hinting at such a network – company officials earlier this year indicated Charter would launch its first CBRS market trial by mid-2022 – but they have not publicly announced plans to launch it.

Charter's mobile partner Comcast on the other hand recently indicated forward momentum on its CBRS network. Comcast owns 600MHz and CBRS spectrum across its cable footprint and last month the company announced it would use 5G radios from Samsung to ""selectively deploy our own 5G radios in dense high-traffic areas of the markets we serve today.""

For Charter and Comcast building their own 5G networks would reduce the money they pay Verizon for MVNO wholesale access to Verizon's 5G network. Charter (via Spectrum Mobile) and Comcast (via Xfinity Mobile) resell Verizon's 5G network and collectively they count more than 9 million mobile customers.

Both companies want to eke out as much profit from their mobile adventures as they can and as a result are building their own wireless networks to take advantage of owners' economics. Indeed Comcast and Charter already use millions of public Wi-Fi hotspots to reduce their reliance on Verizon.

But the synchronization coordination between Charter and Verizon is also noteworthy because it represents a further partnership between the two companies beyond their MVNO. Verizon which operates a 5G network across both C-band and CBRS spectrum continues to maintain that it's happy with its overall MVNO strategy. However any customer who moves from Verizon to a cable company's mobile offering undoubtedly represents a loss of revenue for Verizon.

The company’s subsidiaries Watch Communications and Community Fiber Solutions are also part of the deal.

Benton Ridge can trace its roots back 120 years to when it was founded as a local exchange carrier serving three exchanges. Watch Communications founded in 1992 offers broadband and related services in rural areas of Ohio Indiana Illinois and Kentucky using fiber and fixed wireless. Community Fiber Solutions founded in 2010 offers triple-play services in eastern Indiana and western Ohio using fiber.

It is the latter two properties that apparently were the biggest draw for Cequel III. The purchase price was not disclosed.

“The acquisition by Cequel III will help fuel the continued expansion of rural broadband services provided through our Watch Communications and Community Fiber Solutions subsidiaries” said Benton Ridge President and CEO Chris Daniels in a press release.

Cequel III founded in 2002 is led by Jerry Kent who was a Charter Communications co-founder and who subsequently was part of a team that managed cell tower company AAT Communications before its sale in 2006. The Cequel III team also managed Suddenlink Communications according to a press release.

In 2018 Watch Communications was a big winner in the Connect America Fund (CAF II) auction. According to today’s press release Watch has been “aggressively expanding” its broadband offerings. Since mid-2019 the company has increased subscribers by 62% while revenues have increased 82%.

Cequel III’s plan to purchase Benton Ridge and its subsidiaries is the latest example of private equity investing in the broadband industry through acquisitions.

The investment firms apparently see big opportunity in broadband as broadband consumption continues to climb. And as the U.S. has made it a priority to make broadband available nationwide rural providers such as Benton Ridge Telephone Company and its subsidiaries may be particularly attractive.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIyMTAwNDAwNjA5MS9lbi9CZW50b24tUmlkZ2UtVGVsZXBob25lLWFuZC1JdHMtQnJvYWRiYW5kLVN1YnNpZGlhcmllcy10by1iZS1BY3F1aXJlZC1ieS1JbnZlc3RtZW50LWFuZC1NYW5hZ2VtZW50LUZpcm0tQ2VxdWVsLUlJSdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Benton Ridge Telephone and Its Broadband Subsidiaries to be Acquired by Investment and Management Firm Cequel III,"LIMA Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Benton Ridge Telephone Company (“BRTC” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that its Shareholders have approved the acquisition of the Company and its subsidiaries by Cequel III a St. Louis based investment and management firm with a rich legacy in the telecommunications industry. Pending regulatory approvals the acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2022. The purchase price was not disclosed.

“This is an exciting and challenging time in the telecommunications industry” said BRTC President and CEO Chris Daniels. “The demand for reliable high-speed broadband services has intensified over the past two years driven by a shift in how people work learn and are entertained. This has resulted in an unprecedented focus on the ubiquitous delivery of broadband to all Americans and a sense of urgency to deliver faster and more reliable services than are available in many rural areas today. The acquisition by Cequel III will help fuel the continued expansion of rural broadband services provided through our Watch Communications ('Watch') and Community Fiber Solutions ('CFS') subsidiaries.”

The BRTC family of companies provides broadband voice video and related services using a hybrid fiber and fixed wireless approach. As the seventh largest recipient of Connect America Phase II funding Watch has been aggressively expanding its high-speed broadband services and areas of coverage since mid-2019 and has increased subscribers and revenue by 62% and 82% respectively. Both Watch and CFS are heavily investing in the upgrade of their network infrastructure to enable the reliable and consistent delivery of broadband services between 100Mbps and 1Gbps to all customers over the next two years.

Cequel III is led by Jerry Kent a recognized entrepreneur and trailblazer in the telecommunications and technology industries with an outstanding track record of customer service and delivering superior returns for investors. In 1993 Kent co-founded Charter Communications building that company into one of the 10 largest cable operators in the U.S. Charter led the industry in superior operating results and from its IPO date until September 2001 the month Kent left Charter’s was the best performing public cable stock. After co-founding Cequel III in 2002 Kent and team managed AAT Communications which they grew into the largest privately owned cell tower company in the U.S. before its sale in 2006. The Cequel III team also managed Suddenlink Communications which – at the time of its sale in 2015 – was the seventh largest U.S. cable company and also had operating results among the best in its industry. The Benton Ridge family of companies will be Cequel III’s only telecommunications business in its current investment portfolio giving the firm a solid platform for growth. Cequel III’s investment in BRTC will be made through its family office direct investment arm.

“Like BRTC’s leadership team we’re committed to bringing advanced dependable broadband services to underserved rural communities” said Jerry Kent. “The Cequel III team’s track record and expertise in broadband will help enhance the already exceptional service the BRTC companies deliver to their customers. We’re excited to support their mission and help them build on their long and impressive legacy.”

KPMG Corporate Finance LLC acted as exclusive financial advisor to BRTC on the sale of the Company to Cequel III.

Research now shows them stagnating and job unhappiness is at an all-time high.

So what makes a good job well good? There’s now actually a working definition for employers to read and heed.

“Good jobs are essential to a healthy economy successful businesses strong communities thriving families and a well-functioning democracy” begins a statement released today by the Good Jobs Champions Group a joint venture of the Families and Workers Fund and the Aspen Institute Economic Opportunities Program. The group’s definition signed by more than 100 leaders across industries lays out the three pillars of a good job: economic stability; economic mobility; and equity respect and voice.

These three areas emerge as not just helpful in wooing and retaining talent but crucial in employers’ relationships and communications with their workers on the job. Translated into action items they might be applied and demonstrated in the following ways:

Economic stability: a wage that’s enough to afford food to eat and a place to live health insurance transit credits or discounts.

Economic mobility: learning new skills career development cost-of-living adjustments a path to advancement or promotion bonus or commission structures.

Equity respect and voice: regular check-ins affinity groups two-way feedback sessions a willingness to listen and change.

The group’s manifesto shared with me last week for release today are impressive for the socioeconomic range and unifying vision it encompasses. I am guilty here week after week of focusing on white-collar workers having the right to balance and flexibility. When it comes to lower-wage workers I have been less vocal assuming a gulf in priorities: that while people who like their jobs likely have the privilege to focus on career growth and happiness the folks who don’t like their jobs are likely not making enough or feeling enough stability to think about satisfaction and advancement.

Rachel Korberg executive director of the Families and Workers Fund corrected me. “It’s not just about pay—many low-wage workers also place a high value on having the voice and power to improve their workplace feeling a sense of purpose on the job or having advancement opportunities” she says. “On the flip side people who work in highly-compensated jobs could be overlooked for advancement opportunities due to their race gender or other identity characteristics or might not be supported to meet their caregiving responsibilities.”

This reckoning with what it really means to have a good job comes amid a growing questioning of how we might define ourselves less by what we do for a living. The pandemic has made people consider the role of work in their lives and increasingly workers seek a sense of purpose and value in their jobs.

A good job today says Maureen Conway executive director of the Aspen Institute Economic Opportunities Program needs to offer that flexibility. “It strikes me that people often describe the quality of their jobs in terms of how their job makes them feel about themselves (a sense of accomplishment pride in being associated with the organization feeling responsible/trusted/valued as a member of the organization)” she says “and how well their job supports them in their ability to manage daily life and care for loved ones.”

Indeed external factors are changing the nature of work and moving income out of the hands of employers. Several cities across California are currently testing guaranteed income in an experiment that already feels revolutionary especially for people of color. One San Francisco program called Miracle Messages gave $500 a month to homeless people in the city through a GoFundMe campaign. About half went on to find housing after receiving the cash payments. Massachusetts is home to some of the biggest guaranteed income pilots in the country through a mix of government and nonprofit efforts.

Last year Matthew Taylor authored a provocative book examining the future of jobs in our society titled Do We Have To Work? Taylor based in the UK and the chairman of the NHS Confederation questions the need for a constantly moving “growth escalator” and suggests that we find ways to step off the “hedonic treadmill” that has us continually craving more money power and consumer goods. The book outlines new ways to approach work such as a universal basic income and more self-employment that might allow us to define ourselves by the people we are versus the work we do.

That shift feels especially urgent given that the premise of the Good Jobs Champions Group’s work rests on an alarming stat: Less than half of U.S. workers say they are in a good job according to Gallup research published last year. The common traits of a bad job says Korberg are:

Not being paid enough

Workers feeling unable to care for children or their own mental or physical health

A bad boss (such as bullying or disrespectful supervisor or sexual harassment on the job; the highest rates of this are reported in restaurants and hospitality)

Being passed over for training opportunities

Unsafe working conditions

Not being heard at work

A bad commute

Feeling misalignment with your own values

Feeling work is dull or boring

Asked about the changing nature of identity tied to work Korberg reiterated the need for good jobs. “Everyone should have access to a good job” she says “whether you’re someone who wants to make the job your identity or just wants to work earn a paycheck and then go home at the end of the day and not think about work. Both relationships with work have a place in our society but seeking a sense of purpose at work shouldn’t provide an excuse for offering low-quality jobs.”

One example is child care workers and educators often doing the work because they have a passion for working with children and making a difference in their lives. “The country is relying on their sense of passion and purpose to justify extremely low and often poverty-level wages” says Korberg a strategy that’s currently imploding as workers leave the field in droves.

The inclusion of these essential workers in discussions and definitions of good jobs seems key—and a distinguishing trait of the group’s work. “During pandemic times a conversation about purpose flexibility and trajectory seemed focused on privileged workers who were suddenly in isolation and working on Zoom—and it was a conversation that these workers were included in” reminds Conway. “At the same time there was a conversation about essential workers which both lauded and pitied them but it wasn’t a conversation that included these workers in any meaningful way.”

Whether the pandemic is over might be up for debate. Whether we still need these essential workers to function as an economy—as the past two years have made abundantly clear—is not.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zaGVib3lnYW5wcmVzcy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9wb2xpdGljcy9lbGVjdGlvbnMvMjAyMi8xMC8wNS9zaGVib3lnYW4tY2FuZGlkYXRlcy1hc3NlbWJseS1kaXN0cmljdC0yNi1jbGltYXRlLWNoYW5nZS1pbmZsYXRpb24vODE2NzMwNTAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sheboygan County candidates for Wisconsin Assembly District 26 discuss election integrity inflation climate change ...,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.sheboyganpress.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /story/news/politics/elections/2022/10/05/sheboygan-candidates-assembly-district-26-climate-change-inflation/8167305001/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC930E7A0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zaGVib3lnYW5wcmVzcy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9wb2xpdGljcy9lbGVjdGlvbnMvMjAyMi8xMC8wNS9zaGVib3lnYW4tY2FuZGlkYXRlcy1hc3NlbWJseS1kaXN0cmljdC0yNi1jbGltYXRlLWNoYW5nZS1pbmZsYXRpb24vODE2NzMwNTAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

(2022),"The fire breakout in Yishun on 1 October 2022 saw over a hundred residents evacuated and five people taken to Singapore General Hospital.

If anything the pictures of the charred items in the blackened living room of the affected fifth-floor unit taught us several things: don’t accumulate clutter take fire hose reel cabinets in your apartment block for granted and get HDB fire insurance.

According to the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF)  they responded to 1844 fire calls in 2021. While this number decreases 1.8% from 1877 calls in 2020 there were more fire injuries recorded. In 2021 194 people had fire injuries; an increase from 184 in 2020. Three people also died due to a fire outbreak last year.

Fires of electrical origin were the leading cause of fires (588 cases or 31.9% of all the fires) followed by fires caused by cooking (408 cases or 22.1% of all fires).

If the above statistics are alarming ask yourself: are you sufficiently protected against fire accidents at home?

Owners of flats might remember purchasing compulsory HDB fire insurance when buying their homes. However the coverage for that isn’t nearly as comprehensive as home insurance.

HDB fire insurance  as we will share more below only covers structures from HDB. As such your furniture and any interior design work you may have done will not be insured in case of a fire outbreak. So if HDB fire insurance is all you have there’s probably much more can do to prepare for the worst and comprehensive home insurance could be the way to go.

An Overview of HDB Fire Insurance and Home Insurance

Here’s an overview of the key differences between HDB fire insurance and home insurance:



HDB Fire Insurance Vs Home Insurance: The Key Differences

Many homeowners believe that this fire insurance covers them for all damages caused when a fire breaks out. This is incorrect. In fact only home insurance will cover all damages from a fire.

The difference between an HDB fire insurance and home insurance is that home insurance will cover all your renovations furniture and house content. Home insurance will not only cover fire damages but floods and thefts too. For a higher insurance premium your home insurance can also offer protection against a wider range of situations.

HDB Fire Insurance ⁠– Compulsory the Bare Minimum

If you own an HDB flat you probably know that you’re covered by the compulsory HDB fire insurance scheme currently offered by FWD. However the question is whether this is enough.

HDB fire insurance covers only damages to your flat’s structure as well as fixtures and fittings provided by HDB. It does not cover renovations furnishings and your home’s contents.

For these you’ll need to purchase separate home insurance with cover for your home’s contents.

Home Insurance That Covers Fires – More Comprehensive but More Expensive Too

There are two generally two kinds of home insurance available:

Insured peril: This covers you for specific events or mishaps such as fires floods and thefts.

All risks: As implied by its name this offers you protection for a wider range of situations. They are therefore usually more expensive.

Compulsory HDB Fire Insurance by FWD

Even if you think the compulsory HDB fire insurance is enough don’t forget that you need to renew it every five years. Here’s a guide on how to do that and how much it costs.

How Do You Purchase And/Or Renew Your HDB Fire Insurance?

Every HDB flat purchase from HDB requires a mandatory HDB fire insurance purchase from the appointed insurer. Remember that the HDB fire insurance is only valid for five years. Once it expires you’ll need to do your renewal of the HDB fire insurance.

Luckily with the advancement of technology renewing/purchasing HDB fire insurance is easier than ever – simply renew it on FWD’s website . You can also buy your insurance via any AXS kiosk. Alternatively if you prefer a face-to-face meet-up with an FWD representative instead you can also head over to their office

How Much Does HDB Fire Insurance Cost?

The cost of HDB fire insurance will be reviewed periodically by HDB. At the moment as of 16 August 2019 to 15 August 2024 the 5-year premium and sum assured are listed below:

Types of Home Insurance That Cover Fires

If you think that you’d like more protection just in case there are two generally two kinds of home insurance that cover your home for fires:

Insured peril: This covers you for specific events or mishaps such as fires floods and thefts.

All risks: As implied by its name this offers you protection for a wider range of situations. They are therefore usually more expensive.

Coverage may differ across different home content insurance policies. But in general these areas are covered:

What home insurance covers How home insurance differs from HDB fire insurance Fitting fixtures and renovation work HDB’s fire insurance covers only the flat’s original physical structure as well as fixtures and fittings.



Home insurance can cover renovations you’ve done along with fixtures and fittings you’ve installed. Contents of your home This includes household items and appliances such as televisions refrigerators and computers etc.



HDB fire insurance does not cover for the contents of your home. Personal items money and valuables There is typically a cap on much you can claim for each item type.



HDB fire insurance does not cover for the loss of personal content due to fire. Alternative accommodation If your home becomes inhabitable you will most likely need to find a temporary place to stay. Home insurance provides a daily payout to pay for alternative accommodation. However this is usually limited to a specific number of days.



If you only have HDB fire insurance you will need to pay for the temporary accommodation out of your own pocket. Personal accident for you your family and domestic helper



These individuals will be covered for medical expenses or a payout in the case of death or disability. This coverage could come as part of a purchased plan or as an add-on.



As you would already have guessed HDB fire insurance doesn’t cover this. Personal liability This protects you if you become legally liable for certain mishaps and incidents at home. For example in the very unlikely event your fridge topples over and hurts a guest you could be held liable.



HDB fire insurance doesn’t cover any personal liability in the event that guests are hurt at your home. Pets This usually applies only for dogs and cats and to certain breeds and pedigrees. Depending on your insurer this may be an add-on.



HDB fire insurance won’t pay you for losses incurred if your pet happens to be caught in the fire.

PMD-related Fires Decreased from 2019 but Fires Involving PABs Doubled

While Singapore is generally safe from natural disasters there is no shortage of scenarios that call for home insurance.

Kitchen fires could damage structures such as water piping appliances and electrical wiring. Flooding may be another concern. Burst pipes could flood your toilet and nearby areas even your neighbour’s property and total repairs could cost up to $25000.

While fires caused by personal mobility devices (PMDs) have dipped a significant 40.9% (dropping from 115 cases in 2019 to 68 cases in 2020) there has been an upwards trend of Power Assisted Bicycles (PAB)-related fires. Cases doubled from 13 cases in 2019 to 26 cases in 2020.

Not only will such situations cause a serious dent in your finances you may also be liable for damage to a neighbour’s property. If you only had HDB fire insurance you will be looking at a huge financial loss that can’t be covered by insurance. As such it is always advisable to err on the side of caution and get your home insured.

What to Consider When Buying HDB Home Insurance

Like most forms of insurance the cheapest policy or the one with the greatest coverage may not be ideal for you. You should always make sure you’re not over or under-insuring.

If you’re staying in a smaller flat like a studio apartment or 2-room flat  it’s probably not prudent to put a large hole in your wallet for home insurance especially if you rent a separate storage space for your more valuable items or do not keep valuables in your home. Conversely consider forking out a bit more if you’re staying in larger property such as an executive maisonette or semi-detached

Your lifestyle needs and priorities for coverage are other factors to keep in mind. If getting personal accident coverage for your family members is more important you’d be looking at a different plan from someone who lives alone with a pet

You should be able to customize your plan accordingly through the many riders offered by insurers. Just make sure they are within your budget.

Where to Buy Home Insurance From?

While there is only one appointed HDB fire insurance insurer there are plenty of insurers that are licensed to sell you a home insurance policy.

Scrimping on Your HDB Fire Insurance or Home Insurance Premium Isn’t the Best Way to save

Paying for any type of insurance especially in one lump sum can cause a significant dent in your finances. It can be tempting to scrimp on HDB fire insurance because fires aren’t exactly an everyday common occurrence.

And no: screaming ""Choy touch wood!"" is not a legit way of warding off fires.

If you want to save you can look into home refinancing . It’s the shrewder way of saving money. That’s because what you save from smart home refinancing will be more than enough to cover your home insurance premiums for a few years.

Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Chicago has been around for 125 years and acted as the primary church for three surrounding neighborhoods of Ashland Avenue.

The church held its first mass in October 1892 and was physically moved in 1929.

It took the efforts of 50 men and their horses to pry the 10000 ton church from its foundation move it across the street and rotate it 90 degrees. According to a Chicago Ancestry site the church was moved at a 'foot a minute.'

'It is a magnificent historically and architecturally significant church' said church preservation advocate Julie Sawacki on the steps leading to the church's entrance. 'Imagine tearing something so significant down.'

The church in its present form was built in 1916 and moved across a street by 50 men and horses in 1929

The Archdiocese of Chicago told CBS News that attendance at the church's Sunday masses have steadily declined.

The church simultaneously needs $2 million worth of repairs and without the community's support its likely it will be demolished.

There are a group of parishioners including Hilda Correa who are desperately trying to save the famed religious landmark. Correa and others say the church attracts tourists both Christian and non-Christian.

Correa also alluded to the fact that times are hard. Although she didn't specify what she was talking about - perhaps the years-long pandemic or stubborn inflation - Correa says the church is a place of comfort for those who come to visit.

Hilda Correa left and Julie Sawacki right as well as a number of others passionate about keeping Our Lady of Lourdes alive made impassioned pleas on the steps of the church before its last service on May 19

'The religious aspect is really what's really touching us because losing such a valuable place that people can come especially in these days...'

Our Lady of Lourdes will be holding its final service on May 19 but Preservation Chicago a non-profit organization dedicated to saving city landmarks plans to revive the church and make it into a holy shrine.

'The effort here will probably be long and labored perhaps. There's a lot of different moving parts and a lot of different factors' said Preservation Chicago Executive Director Ward Miller.

There is a Change.org petition with 1107 signatures to preserve the church as a historical landmark rather than knocking it down. The goal is to reach 1500 signatures.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocmlzdGlhbnBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWF0dC1jaGFuZGxlci1yZWZsZWN0cy1vbi1ncmFjZS1oZS1yZWNlaXZlZC1hZnRlci1jb250cm92ZXJzeS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Matt Chandler reflects on 'grace and accountability' he experienced from church after controversy,"Home News Matt Chandler reflects on 'grace and accountability' he experienced from church after controversy

Matt Chandler has opened up about what he learned about grace and accountability after being restored to the pulpit following a tumultuous period in 2022 in which he took a leave of absence from teaching and preaching at The Village Church in Flower Mound Texas.

In August 2022 Chandler announced to The Village Church congregation which he has led since 2002 that he had an inappropriate online relationship with a woman and would be taking an indefinite leave of absence from preaching and teaching.

Though the relationship was not sexual or romantic Chandler said church elders deemed the messages exchanged over Instagram ""unguarded and unwise"" and ""revealed something unhealthy in me.""

""We cannot be a church where anyone is above the scriptures and above the high heavenly call into Christ Jesus"" Chandler said adding he agreed with the elder's assessment. ""The Word of God holds me to a certain standard. And I fell short.""

He was restored to the pulpit a little over three months later following a ""profound time of healing.""

In an interview with The Christian Post the 49-year-old husband and father-of-three reflected on that time and said that when he ""stumbled"" he was instantly met with grace and accountability from those around him.

""The thing about [2022] in particular was that the kind of culture we had tried to build here — one of accountability and a higher standard for a person in public ministry — held strong"" Chandler explained. ""When I stumbled I was met with both grace and accountability.""

For Chandler — who has made messages on God's grace a hallmark of his ministry — the experience solidified the notion that grace is not an abstract concept but a tangible force that exists alongside the weight of accountability.

He credited his church's transparent handling of the controversy with allowing his congregation to witness the reality of both concepts in action; they saw firsthand he said that while grace offers forgiveness there is often a price for missteps.

In the aftermath Chandler observed that the church community became more willing to confess their struggles taking proactive steps to address what he described as ""little lions"" or small issues that could grow into significant problems if left unchecked.

""What that produced in our congregation is another visible picture that that grace is real and that there is still at times a payment for stumbling that is costly in other areas"" he said.

""We have seen since people are more apt to confess more quickly … we have seen a tremendous amount of trust in the processes we have in place to deal with those kinds of things in the lives of people. And so that's been the fruit of that.""

Reflecting on the unique pressures of pastoral ministry Chandler who also serves as executive director of the church-planting network Acts 29 spoke candidly about the loneliness and mental health challenges often faced by spiritual leaders.

Chandler previously served as president of Acts 29 replacing Mark Driscoll who was later disqualified from leadership due to ""ungodly and disqualifying behavior.""

""I think I'm an outlier on this but I've never bought into that a pastor can't be close friends with the guys that he does ministry with"" he said.

Though acknowledging that stories of betrayal and sabotage from within the Church aren't uncommon Chandler said that throughout his ministry he's chosen to cultivate meaningful relationships with those around him.

""I've been involved at the highest level with church planning stuff the number of stories of men being betrayed and sabotaged by other people in the church or other staff members in the church is a very real thing. I'm just not built personality wise to want to do this by myself.""

At The Village Church — a Southern Baptist congregation — Chandler is one of three lead pastors. While his influence might be more visible due to his pulpit presence he emphasized that he has no greater vote in decision-making.

""I have done life deeply with a group of five guys that are on staff with me"" he said. ""Two of those relationships are over 15 years going now and the other ones are right at a decade. I have chosen to not give in to the 'I'm going to carry this thing by myself.' I'm going to invite guys into my life.""

For Chandler this network of trust has been critical particularly when it comes to the ups and downs of the ministry.

""I would encourage guys as best they can to create a strong circle of trust where they don't have to be the hero but can be human. And I say that because they are human"" he advised.

The pastor recently released his first book since returning to the pulpit The Overcomers highlighting how Revelation can help Christians find their ""identity and purpose in God's plan."" He cautioned against creating a culture where pastors are seen as infallible.

""If you create a world where you're the Messiah where you have all the answers you're making an already difficult situation impossible"" he stressed. ""I would encourage any pastor … to begin to create slowly but surely a circle of trust for him that's deeply honest and vulnerable for the good of his own soul.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjQvbWF5LzEwL3N5ZG5leS1jaHVyY2gtc3RhYmJpbmctYXVzdHJhbGlhLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtdnMteC1lbG9uLW11c2stZS1zYWZldHktb3JkZXItaW52YWxpZNIBjAFodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjQvbWF5LzEwL3N5ZG5leS1jaHVyY2gtc3RhYmJpbmctYXVzdHJhbGlhLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtdnMteC1lbG9uLW11c2stZS1zYWZldHktb3JkZXItaW52YWxpZA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Order from eSafety to hide Sydney church stabbing video was invalid X tells court,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.theguardian.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /technology/article/2024/may/10/sydney-church-stabbing-australia-government-vs-x-elon-musk-e-safety-order-invalid (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC8CF43D0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjQvbWF5LzEwL3N5ZG5leS1jaHVyY2gtc3RhYmJpbmctYXVzdHJhbGlhLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtdnMteC1lbG9uLW11c2stZS1zYWZldHktb3JkZXItaW52YWxpZNIBjAFodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjQvbWF5LzEwL3N5ZG5leS1jaHVyY2gtc3RhYmJpbmctYXVzdHJhbGlhLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtdnMteC1lbG9uLW11c2stZS1zYWZldHktb3JkZXItaW52YWxpZA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9hZHZpY2UvMjAyNC8wNS8xMC9jYXJvbHluLWhheC1pbi1sYXdzLWxpdmUtc3RyZWFtLWNodXJjaC1hdHRlbmRhbmNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Advice | Carolyn Hax: In-laws stalk the live stream to check couple's attendance at church,"Hi Carolyn: Our church started streaming its services online during the pandemic and this continues today.

Kaitlyn Fisher was charged with three counts of felony grand theft on May 3.

Court documents say on Oct. 14 2022 an employee of the Presbytery of Kendall reported that Fisher the administrative clerk had been embezzling from church funds.

The Presbytery of Kendall is an organization that oversees the Presbyterian churches in the eastern Idaho area. According to a church newsletter obtained by EastIdahoNews.com Fisher was the administrative executive assistant.

EastIdahoNews.com has attempted to contact the Presbytery of Kendall by phone and email for comment and we are awaiting their response.

The reporting party told police the staff had not met for annual financial review meetings since the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time she repeatedly asked Fisher who acted as a secretary and bookkeeper for a summary of the church organization’s financials.

In October 2022 the board of trustees chair obtained the organization’s bank statements after asking the banks directly.

In the statements the employees reportedly discovered “numerous unauthorized purchases and transfers out of both accounts via Venmo and Paypal as far back as 2020.”

The two employees confronted Fisher on Oct. 10 where she allegedly admitted to making the unauthorized transfers and purchases.

On Dec. 6 an Idaho Falls Police officer contacted Fisher about the allegations and she denied stealing the money.

Over a week later the officer contacted a criminal investigator with the Idaho State Tax Commission who was able to issue and serve subpoenas for Fisher’s PayPal and Venmo account records.

In the transaction history investigators discovered at least $338458 worth of unauthorized purchases made from Fishers account allegedly using church funds between January 2019 and October 2022.

According to police reports Fisher used the money to buy a red 2018 Honda 4-wheeler from Action Motor Sports to pay The Yard Butler a local landscape designer and debited between $280890.01 and $281474 from the church organization’s Wells Fargo account.

Venmo account records showed Fisher’s Venmo account was linked to the church’s Wells Fargo account as a payment method for transactions.

Transaction descriptions further show Fisher allegedly used the money to pay for child care furniture a dog dog waste cleanup food gasoline her mortgage and supplies/labor to finish the basement of her new house.

Between July and October 2022 alone Fisher allegedly spend at least $38801.84 from the church’s Idaho Central Credit Union account.

A warrant was issued for Fisher’s arrest on May 3 and she was booked into the Bonneville County Jail on May 7. Her bail was set to $30000. She posted bond and was released on the same day.

Fisher is expected to appear for a preliminary hearing on May 29. If convicted she could face up to 42 years in prison.

Though Fisher has been charged with these crimes it does not necessarily mean she committed them. Everyone is presumed innocent until they are proven guilty."

Now their first-rate care has become even more accessible. BSSNY’s team of renowned doctors has announced that they will accept major commercial insurance plans going forward.

The president of BSSNY Dr. John M. Abrahams had this to say about the news: “BSSNY is proud to offer their services to their patients as participating providers. In the past insurance companies made it difficult to join their networks — but because of our size and clinical research we have successfully negotiated with most plans that satisfy both the providers and insurance company goals.”

Regardless of the insurance used BSSNY will continue to provide the high standard of care its patients are accustomed to. The change serves to speed up and ease the administrative process. It allows patients covered by an accepted insurance plan to focus on their health rather than the paperwork.

The newly-accepted insurance providers in question are the most substantial in the industry including Cigna Aetna Oxford MVP United Healthcare and Blue Cross Blue Shield.

“In the past” said Dr. Abrahams “we were limited in patient referrals because we were out of network. This allows BSSNY to offer all of our specialty services to our local community and beyond.”

At BSSNY dozens of highly-skilled doctors work tirelessly to give specialized care for a variety of neurological conditions including:

Cerebrovascular (aneurysm stroke intracerebral hemorrhage etc.)

Concussions

Epilepsy

Facial and Cranial Pain

Headaches (migraines cluster tension)

Neuropathic Pain

Pain Management (cancer-related thoracic lumbar spine myofascial)

Pediatric Neurosurgery

Plastic Surgery (reconstructive and cosmetic)

Scoliosis

Spinal Issues

Tumors (brain cerebral base head and neck pituitary acoustic)

Not only does BSSNY want to expand access for those in need they wish to do it quickly. Healthcare patients are too often forced to wait months for consultation and treatment. BSSNY always aims to expedite the process and the new insurance provider agreements are another way to do that.

Brain and Spine Surgeons of New York is headquartered at its main office in White Plains. After nearly 65 years in business they are a staple medical institution in the Hudson Valley and for neurological patients across the country. They have expanded care in Rockland county with a new office at 10 Waldron Avenue in Nyack.

BSSNY strives to have the most advanced state-of-the-art equipment and treatment options available to its patients. Even still the practice is always looking for ways to evolve. In addition to newly accepting major insurance plans they recently opened The Center for Cognitive Health a groundbreaking one-stop-shop that combines neuropsychology neurology and neuropsychologist to create a streamlined and complete patient experience.

Contact the BSSNY team to check whether your insurance plan is now in-network or make an appointment online.

Kevin’s purple hoodie flaps around his lime green headphones as he bobs his head to the beat. According to his bio his first hip-hop single just went platinum. And on this sizzling Monday in July he’s lip synching for a camera crew at the WCET studios in Over-the-Rhine.

Word is that legendary hip-hop stars Dr. Dre and Eminem inspired Kevin’s new song “Five Thousand Dollars.” It’s a call-and-response rap with singer/songwriter Megan Piphus who lauds her costar as a “talented musician.” She drops a hint of drama though saying “Kevin’s imagination tends to run wild.”

Director Colin Scianamblo wants more dancing and Kevin responds with enthusiastic gyrations. He twists his body in time with the beat lifts his arms when the music swells and closes the song with a beatbox flourish. Kevin leans into the microphone his mouth mimicking the percussion rhythm. As the music fades Scianamblo shakes his head. “Kevin really looks real sometimes” he says with a sigh.

Kevin is not real. At least he’s not flesh and bones. He’s a puppet a cloth-and-glue embodiment of Scianamblo’s imagination and a puppeteer’s sleight of hand. His musical abilities are a projection of Piphus who sings both her own and Kevin’s parts on the “Five Thousand Dollars” soundtrack. On a different stage in a different city she’s the voice of Gabrielle a 6-year-old Muppet on Sesame Street.

If Kevin could speak for himself he’d certainly credit Piphus and the CET team for his artistic flair. He’d also tell you he owes his existence to a number-crunching economist Julie Heath who laughs when I mention Dr. Dre and Eminem. “I’m more of an oldies person” she says.

Heath’s motives for giving Kevin life are all about money but don’t get the wrong idea—that’s a good thing. Kevin may be the key to her ambitious plans to foster a generation of financially healthy consumers. Along the way he and his puppet castmates are unlocking creativity both in front of and behind the cameras.

Julie Heath arrived as director of the Alpaugh Family Economics Center at the University of Cincinnati in 2012. The center had already established itself as one of the largest in a network of about 200 economics education centers across the country. Peter Alpaugh and the Alpaugh Family Foundation had just committed to a $1 million gift to support financial and economic education online. Heath saw an opportunity.

Research shows teaching finance to kids reaps money-savvy adults says Chris Caltabiano chief program officer for the Council for Economic Education a national organization representing financial literacy centers. “They have better credit scores and lower loan default rates and they go into less credit card debt while in college” he says. Those kinds of outcomes prompted state legislatures in about half of the U.S. including Ohio and Kentucky to pass laws requiring personal finance courses or programming for high school graduation.

Heath supports high school classes in financial literacy but she also fears they’re too little too late. Spending patterns are set by age 7 she says so she lobbies for introducing financial values to kids as young as 3. By the time students get to high school they’ll be able to grasp increasingly complex ideas that she reasons “will have something to stick to rather than being introduced in a vacuum.” She smiles wistfully. “That’s the dream.”

In 2016 Heath’s dream led the economics center to invest in $martPath a free digital financial education platform. Stories about cartoon bears skunks and robots illustrate how to save money and distinguish between cash and credit. The target audience: elementary kids. The approach: age appropriate.

“We’re not teaching a 5-year-old to write a check” says Heath. “We’re teaching a 5-year-old that if you borrow something you give it back in the same condition they gave it to you. We’re teaching a 5-year-old that if you choose this you’re giving up that.”

Financial literacy isn’t about vocabulary she explains. It’s a way of thinking. Heath recalls visiting a fourth-grade class in Memphis after launching Tennessee’s financial literacy program in the mid-2000s. She asked a 10-year-old named Kobe what he’d learned. “He said I’ve learned how to make good choices.” Impressed Heath asked if the stuff he’d learned would help him in the future. “He said Oh yes. Now I know I shouldn’t join a gang.”

Heath’s perspective shifted that day. “There was nothing about gang membership pros and cons in the curriculum” she says. “I went up to the teacher we stepped out in the hall and I cried a little bit. I asked the teacher Did you make that connection at all? She said No he did that.” Heath pauses. “That is the power of economic and financial education. When we give children the tools to make good decisions when we give them the critical thinking ability to think through whatever their life is we give them hope.”

Over the last six years $martPath has spread hope to more than 2 million kids and the curriculum has won five national awards. But in 2017 Heath went looking for more. “If a product doesn’t develop and grow” she says “it becomes stale.” Soon revelation struck.

Reading The Cincinnati Enquirer Heath’s eyes stopped on a photo. Megan Piphus was lying on her back flashing her trademark radiant smile in one of those heads-in-a-circle poses. The other heads were puppets. The article provided an update on the self-taught ventriloquist from Cincinnati who traveled the country as a teen singing at schools and churches. She graduated at the top of her Princeton High School class in 2010 then earned a bachelor’s degree in economics and a master’s in finance at Vanderbilt University. Her recognition as a ventriloquist grew spurred by a 2013 run on America’s Got Talent. She launched a career in real estate finance in 2017 but she never gave up performing. The story headline read: “Given a choice between finance and ventriloquism she chose both.”

“It was like I’d been hit with a bolt of lightning” says Heath. “She was so captivating. And the picture with those puppets all around her head—my eyes were just opened. I knew that it had to be puppets. How fun is that? Thank goodness she agreed.”

Heath shopped the idea of financial literacy videos featuring puppets to potential partners. Kitty Lensman CEO of CET/Think TV public television in Cincinnati and Dayton immediately wanted in. The project fit the station’s educational mission and filled a programming gap for young children. Heath’s puppet vision sealed the deal. “I’m thinking Sesame Street meets financial literacy” Lensman says.

But funders were not as enthused. “I assumed I don’t know why that it would be easy to get funding for this” says Heath. “Can’t everybody see how cool this would be?” She submitted applications to multiple arts and financial education foundations for a year and a half with no success.

A 2018 e-mail finally changed her fortunes. Heath saw the message during a hiking trip with her husband at Glacier National Park: “Call me right away.” She didn’t recognize the name and delayed responding. So it took several days to get the news that she’d won the Lighting the Way Award sponsored by the SunTrust Foundation to recognize nonprofits working in financial education. The prize included $75000. Heath calls it “manna from heaven.” She told the award contact “I’m going to use this money to make puppet videos.”

Heath’s ability to frame financial literacy concepts for children has earned national acclaim. But none of her experience prepared her for producing high-quality puppet videos. “I was clueless” she says. Staff at CET shared similar naivete. “We’re not puppeteers” says Lensman. “We’re storytellers and producers.” But Scianamblo who had joined the station in 2015 to produce interview shows and documentaries found the puppet challenge intriguing. It brought back childhood memories of watching PBS broadcasts of Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood. “I felt like it was an opportunity to continue that tradition” he says.

Scianamblo took charge of CET’s production process. It consumed him. He huddled with leaders of Madcap Puppet Theater based in Westwood and scoured the internet for puppet-making experts around the world. He studied YouTube videos on credit debt and consulted his girlfriend (now wife) for help sketching character designs. He also organized the building of five elaborate sets including a pirate ship. And like Kevin he let his imagination run wild.

Scianamblo dreamed up the majority of $martPath’s characters and storylines drawing inspiration from curriculum cartoons for characters like Blackbeard a pirate who learns to conserve limited resources as he faces a dwindling supply of cannonballs. Other ideas came from life experience. Good Boy is a sheepdog who distinguishes between goods (dog food chew toys dog bowls leashes) and services (proper training to keep him classy grooming and brushing to keep him fancy). Scianamblo’s third-grade teacher had a sheep dog named Jack Benny whom everybody loved.

An Australian puppet builder shaped the dog’s shaggy-but-loveable look. Bootsy Collins Cincinnati’s Grammy-winning funk superstar produced his song and provided vocals: “I will sing out ruff ruff when you buy me stuff stuff.”

In all $martPath videos feature about 20 puppet characters. Heath introduces me to a few when we get together in June. “It’s kind of creepy” she says as we enter a small breakroom in the Alpaugh Family Economic Center’s office at UC. Heath points out the refrigerator and coffee machine next to the stack of plastic bins containing puppet figures. “We don’t stand much on ceremony around here” she says.

Heath opens a bin digs through foam nuggets and uncovers a big-eyed Flea the Frog. She sticks her hand in Flea’s back and wiggles his mouth. “I don’t know why his name is Flea” she says patting his head like he’s a family pet. More plastic boxes reveal Bebe the Parrot and pirate mateys who report to Blackbeard. She spots something else. “Blackbeard’s in here!” she says with delight. “Blackbeard is a favorite because of all the aarghs.”

Back in her office Heath offers insights on the cast. “They have their own personalities” she says. “Some of them are sassy some are shy some are kind.” She doesn’t hesitate when I ask if she has a favorite. “It’s Kevin.”

According to Scianamblo Kevin’s models were a young Barack Obama and singer John Legend. “He’s a great communicator but also a great musician” he says. Heath sees a bit of Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow in him. “He has the same non-arrogant swagger” she says shrugging. “I have no idea if Joe Burrow would be pleased with that comparison or not.”

$martPath celebrated the release of its first six puppet videos with a red-carpet event in February 2020. Published on the $martPath website YouTube and PBS Learning Media the 5- to 10-minute clips and accompanying lesson plans proved instant hits among kids teachers and parents. They also won three regional Emmys and were spotlighted on CNBC.

Heath’s vision has continued to grow. Last year the economics center adapted the lessons to be accessible to children with developmental disabilities including autism and down syndrome. “I can’t think of a population of students for whom teaching good decision making is more important” Heath says. Success led to requests for a second series. Analytics showed viewers preferred singing to dialogue so the new videos will be 3- to 4-minute music clips. Recording began with Kevin on that July day at CET.

In his first video Kevin is a wannabe rapper who tries to buy candy with street cred. The “Five Thousand Dollars” video picks up his story as hip-hop success brings new money hurdles. In the opening narration scene Piphus stands next to a baby grand piano in a mock music studio; Kevin peers through a recording booth window behind her. On a side window Lorenzo Jackson acts as the fictional sound engineer. His role isn’t a stretch. Jackson who is Piphus’s cousin produced the music for four of the first six $martPath videos and has a long recording history with Piphus. “We did ‘Twinkle Twinkle Little Star’ when she was 12 years old” he says. “It was not traditional more like a hip-hop version.”

As the camera rolls Piphus leans against the piano. “Meet Kevin a talented musician who just earned $5000 to turn his latest hit into a music video. Kevin’s imagination tends to run wild. But does he really understand how much everything costs?” Scianamblo’s crew records these lines six times with different camera angles and lighting. “I think we’ve got a winner there” the director says after the sixth take. “But let’s start back on the other side.”

Heath stops by at mid-morning just as Kevin lets his infamous imagination spin in the rap’s first verse:

I’ll make a music video of my dreams

My grand ideas will go on the big screen

I made some cash from recording melodies

How much can I spend for videography?

Kevin’s fantasies for his $5000 video escalate to include dancers a marching band and a yellow Lamborghini (Put it in turbo my fans go loco). Piphus responds with calls for financial restraint.

You have a list of things you need to buy

So make a plan to divide your five

Your music video has a price

So split up your five right

Know your costs and you might

Have funds left over for your next worldwide hit!

As we watch this back-and-forth song Heath says “The goal is to get the lesson across to little kids that it’s exciting to have money and exciting to spend money but you still can’t have everything you want.”

It’s a lesson for adults too. During a lunch break Scianamblo confides that Kevin’s wild imagination reflects his own fanciful musings. “If I had to pick what to put in a music video to make it big bold and exciting I would choose back-up dancers a marching band and a sports car” he says. Standing up to clear his plate he asks “Want to see my Lamborghini?” Of course I do.

We find the dream car parked on a table on a CET set. It’s 3½ feet long. Scianamblo bought this toy ride on Amazon and his team cut a hole in the seat to accommodate Kevin and his puppeteer. “It’s the perfect size for a puppet” says Scianamblo. “I looked into getting a real Lamborghini but driving one up on our loading dock probably would have given me a heart attack. You know I feel like Kevin and I are one in the same in that aspect. We’re both learning how to be financially responsible.”

With one difference. Scianamblo did get his marching band and dancers. Piphus connected him with her aunt and uncle who lead the Kentucky State University dance team and marching band. They recorded Kevin’s dream scenes at CET in August.

Piphus’s connections as well as her background in both musical puppetry and finance have made her invaluable on the project. She appears as herself in all the videos and voices many of the characters including Kevin in the songs. She also writes all of the songs adapting concepts like supply and demand and market equilibrium to musical styles from hip-hop and funk to jazz bluegrass and even cheesy pop ballads.

As of August she’s written and recorded half of the six new songs. Besides “Five Thousand Dollars” Piphus has created a funk pop tune debating the costs and benefits of competitive bowling and crafted a high-tempo number to accompany a pair of hungry rats racing through a grocery while choosing between bread fruit and cheese.

The $martPath team takes pride in running with ideas like singing rats in a grocery but Scianamblo admits to occasionally wondering how far they should go. “There were times like when you’re shooting in a farmer’s field with a herd of cattle that the absurdity of it all hits you” he says. “You wonder if this works.” He reminds himself of the project’s ultimate goals. “As you’re in that field with the puppets and the cows you’re still teaching a lesson.”

Despite Scianamblo’s occasional concerns $martPath’s ability to balance accurate information with zany storylines draws a lot of praise. It’s the reason the Georgia Council on Economic Education decided to support the project financially and plans to train more than 2000 teachers to use the videos this school year according to Executive Director Michael Raymer. “The number one thing is the economics and financial literacy concepts must be right” he says. But puppets are the secret sauce. “You ask 1000 elementary students Do you like puppets? They all say Yeah! To me that’s the hook. They’re going to remember Kevin and they’re going to be singing his songs.”

Donna Beiting can attest to that. She feared her third-graders at Amity Elementary in Deer Park would find puppets too cheesy. Instead they danced and beat their desks to the rhythm when she showed $martPath videos last spring. She recalls a lesson with Scarcity Cat pricing items in his store saying “When the video ended kids’ hands all went up.” They talked about the price of Pokémon cards at Target and comparative shopping for toys on Amazon. Suddenly smart consumer practices made sense. “It was way more powerful than anything I could have done on my own” says Beiting.

Marsha Piphus Megan’s mom and a speech pathologist for Cincinnati Public Schools has participated in workshops and trainings provided by the economic center for decades. During the school year she uses $martPath videos to enhance lessons. The kids love it and she credits the puppet factor. “Our kids are so tech savvy” she says and animated educational materials generally can’t live up to the quality of video games like Minecraft. But when kids see a real person interacting with puppets they’re fascinated.

Aretta Baumgartner a Madcap veteran and national expert on puppets in education says research supports Marsha Piphus’s theory. “It’s because children are so smart” she says. Their brains see puppets like a canvas and they long to create their own visuals and fill in the blanks. “It’s just like any good visual art—it’s in the eye of the beholder.”

Back at CET Heath is immersed in that magical dimension as she watches a puppeteer move Kevin through human-like motions. “The intellectual part of your brain is going This is a bunch of felt and a little bit of structure” she says. “Yet when you watch them it’s like Yeah this is a person. And then you start thinking I wonder what Kevin’s going to do next.”

Outside the puppet realm Heath has many ideas for Kevin’s future—and her own. When $martPath begins releasing the second round of videos in December Heath plans to retire from UC. But she won’t end her relationship with $martPath. The next step might be children’s books featuring the puppet characters or gamifying the curriculum. And she’s up for another set of videos.

The number cruncher in Heath says Kevin and his puppet peers have awakened her whimsical side and unlocked creative ideas in other unexpected areas too. She considers that concept for a moment. “I know business executives go through training and pay a whole lot of money to unlock their creative potential” she says. “All they need is a puppet.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvZG9scGhpbnMtdHlyZWVrLWhpbGwtc2ltcGxlLWZpbmFuY2lhbC1yZWFzb24tY2hvb3NpbmctcGxheS1taWFtadIBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvZG9scGhpbnMtdHlyZWVrLWhpbGwtc2ltcGxlLWZpbmFuY2lhbC1yZWFzb24tY2hvb3NpbmctcGxheS1taWFtaS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dolphins' Tyreek Hill has simple financial reason for choosing to play for Miami,"Tyreek Hill had a simple explanation as to why he wanted to be traded from the Kansas City Chiefs to the Miami Dolphins instead of the New York Jets.

The star wide receiver reportedly had the option to where he was going to be traded. Back in March he told reporters he was always going to ""pick Miami no matter what.""

With the Dolphins getting ready to play the Jets in their Week 5 matchup Hill again talked about the decision to join Miami over New York. His reasoning was a bit more understanding.

""It was very close to happening but it was just those state taxes man"" Hill said. ""I realized I had to make a grown-up decision and here I am in a great city in Miami. It’s great weather. Great people. Beautiful people. Here I am.""

According to the Tax Foundation Florida does not have state individual income tax. That is a good thing for Hill as he signed a four-year $120 million contract extension when he joined the Dolphins.

New Jersey where Hill would have played if he chose the Jets has a 10.75% individual income tax rate. Missouri only had 5.4%.

49ERS' JIMMY GAROPPOLO COULD EARN UP TO $5.6 MILLION IN BONUSES AS STARTING QUARTERBACK

Hill and the Dolphins will miss Tua Tagovailoa as he recovers from a concussion suffered against the Cincinnati Bengals. Teddy Bridgewater will likely be the starter.

""If you go back and watch the clips me and Teddy have some little highlights in there on Dolphins Twitter. I feel like he’s just a veteran guy – having that connection and being able to have some conversations about ball. Teddy understands my play style and I understand where he wants me to be at on the field"" Hill said of his relationship with Bridgewater.

""That’s how we connected deep down the field against the Bengals. Just me and him on the same page. Him telling me ‘Hey ‘Reek if we get a certain coverage I need you on this side of the hash.

It is therefore incumbent on us to develop a succession strategy to make sure our clients continue to receive the highest professional care long after Chip and I are no longer with the business. While Chip and I have no intention of retiring anytime soon the need to have a succession plan was clear and present and after meeting with several firms we realized implementing a succession plan now would allow Chip and me to focus on what we love doing serving our clients as well as offering new services to our clients through our new partnership with Mercer Advisors."" Chip added: ""After meeting with David Barton Vice Chairman and M&A Leader for Mercer Advisors we found extremely high cultural alignment between our two firms beginning with putting clients' interests first and also taking great care of our teams. We also loved that they have in-house estate planning in-house tax return preparation and provide turnkey corporate trustee services including bill pay. The 'fit' between our two firms was perfect and we could not be more excited to join the Mercer Advisors' team.""

David Barton Vice Chairman who led the acquisition of TAAG on behalf of Mercer Advisors stated: ""Jeannette and Chip have built a top-tier RIA that leads with financial planning that delivers advisor alpha to their clients every day. This is exactly the business model we have built on top of our family office chassis. Jeannette Chip and their incredibly talented team are fantastic adds to our growing staff ranks and together we look to grow market share in Ohio and beyond.""

Dave Welling Chief Executive Officer of Mercer Advisors said ""Jeannette and Chip lead a highly respected wealth management team in Cincinnati and their brand is strong. We are thrilled to be expanding our presence in Ohio with a team that has deep connections to the community and we look forward to working together to deliver meaningful results for our shared clients.""

TAAG was exclusively represented by Park Sutton Advisors LLC a leading business advisor and investment banker in the RIA space.

First Scooby-Doo finally established that Velma is canonically queer in the new movie Trick or Treat Scooby-Doo! and now the Star Wars series Andor has revealed that two members of its ragtag band of rebels are and I quote “sharing a blanket”: Vel Sartha (Faye Marsay) and Cinta Kaz (Varada Sethu).

Okay this revelation is very minor and major at the same time. On the minor side it is just a fleeting reference made by Arvel Skeen (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) as he’s giving Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) the 411 on the crew. We do literally see Cinta leaving a hut that she’s clearly sharing with Vel who is wrapped in a blanket as Skeen says that Cinta is sharing a blanket with someone. So that’s pretty clear especially for Star Wars.

Still this is a major development for Star Wars a franchise that has really really struggled to bring LGBTQ+ representation to live-action. Surely we all remember the pioneers of queer rep in Star Wars: Commander Larma D’Acy (Amanda Lawrence) and pilot Wrobie Tyce (Vinette Robinson)! Come on you remember them — they were the lesbian couple shown kissing onscreen for 2.4 seconds during the celebration montage at the end of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.

We do love to see it but representation that can be easily edited out in order to appease international censors isn’t the best representation. You can’t edit out Vel and Cinta. Vel’s arguably the co-lead of this story arc what with her being the leader and all. Of course you can edit out the one line about Cinta “sharing a blanket” but fingers crossed we’ll get more into Vel and Cinta’s relationship next week.

This hasn’t been a problem in the expanded universe where there are dozens of queer characters with major roles. If you want more info you can check out the work of the fan group Pride Squadron. To name a few there’s Marvel Comics’ Doctor Aphra — space archaeologist scam artist and one-time sidekick to Darth Vader — who has many many complicated relationships with numerous women including one of Han Solo’s rivals Sana Starros. There have even been novels and short stories that have confirmed that movie characters like Admiral Holdo and Grand Moff Tarkin are queer (look it up!). There’s a whole rainbow of rep happening just offscreen.

So Andor’s hint at space lesbians is just a hint but it could be something major. This storyline ain’t done yet and it’s incredibly likely that Vel and Cinta are going to get some sort of onscreen confirmation next week.

Of course uh it could be confirmation that comes either before during or after one or both of them die during this incredibly high stakes heist… which would be playing into a very insidious trope. But on the other hand like literally all of these rebels are probably going to die except for Cassian Andor so… well we’ll just have to wait and see what happens. I’m just warning everyone to brace themselves for next week’s episode.

On the plus side: Vel Sartha is getting an action figure. Queer rep on screen and in plastic? What a time to be alive.

Israeli cybersecurity startup Radiflow has partnered with Cisco to integrate Radiflow’s Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with Cisco’s Network Access Control (NAC) solutions in an effort to mitigate attack risks.

This partnership grew out of a specific customer request to protect a building management system in a critical financial facility but addresses the broader security challenges of industrial networks.

“The inherent problem in industrial environments is that OT networks are highly sensitive to third-party technologies limiting the number of tools available to OT cybersecurity teams” Ilan Barda co-founder and CEO of Radiflow told EE Times Europe. “To ensure continuous operation at least in the near term common security mechanisms such as firewalls are not considered viable solutions.”

He continued “While operations continue smoothly by allowing a free flow of data across the network it opens up components to easy access by ill-intentioned hackers. This is the reality of securing legacy devices that were not designed with digital transformation and connectivity in mind.”

In that context Radiflow claims its IDS operates as a passive solution that listens to the network enables asset visibility and inventory mapping detects vulnerabilities and anomalies and sends alerts for action.

“Such a solution that operates without any interference to your network operations helps to prevent attacks that may come through different ports on the IT network” said Barda. “But as this is only on the IT side the joint solution between Cisco’s NAC and Radiflow’s iSID [Industrial Intrusion Detection System] allows alerts to be sent to the NAC from the OT network through a set of rules and configurations. The iSID practically advises the NAC to block a device or a part of the network based on its OT-side detection.” The process is planned out before execution.

Vulnerability assessment

Ilan Barda founder and CEO of Radiflow

While industrial networks may appear as closed-loop systems they can be exposed to security threats and vulnerabilities.

Automation equipment uses industrial protocols which are simple and easy to gain access to making them an ideal cybersecurity target said Barda. “This contrasts with IT protocols which have been hardened over the years to compensate for newly discovered vulnerabilities. Hence devices and pieces in the OT network are highly vulnerable.”

Beside “with remote maintenance and vendor access becoming increasingly common cybersecurity practitioners are tasked with managing ever-expanding perimeters increased complexity and a widening attack surface.”

Acquisition and global expansion

In April Radiflow announced its two-phase acquisition by Sabanci Group an industrial and financial conglomerate to further expand in the EMEA region and in the U.S. The initial phase involves a primary and secondary investment of US$45 million in installments to achieve a majority stake in Radiflow. In the second phase Sabanci intends to acquire 100% of Radiflow by 2025.

“With Sabanci owning and operating industrial sites in energy power transmission power distribution manufacturing and BMS Radiflow will now gain direct access to these sites direct communication with key experts (CISOs OT Managers etc.) and provide continuous insights based on data directly from the field (sites/plants)” said Barda. “This provides Radiflow with new capabilities to optimize our solutions and services and address pressing challenges such as alert fatigue focusing on the most critical day-to-day challenges.”

Radiflow said its expansion plans are underway with the hiring of sales managers and technical sales personnel in both the U.S. and EMEA. “Our teams are growing and we are able to expand our services to end-user customers as well as our partners to further strengthen our global presence and operations.”

2021 was a year of transition for Julie Monaco as her team expanded its strategic sovereign advisory business to address client vulnerabilities in food energy and security.

Monaco is the Global Head of Citi's Public Sector Group leading an organization that provides a full range of banking advisory treasury and trade solutions and capital markets services to public sector clients around the world. Recently her group has been focused on issues of sustainability governance debt restructuring and helping sovereign governments attract financial investment to alleviate economic insecurities—many of which have become further complicated by a stronger dollar rapidly increasing inflation and rising interest rates. Together with her product partners throughout Citi debt restructuring and ESG have been brought together to drive the production of ESG-oriented bonds and push sustainable financing into the mainstream.

In an interview with Yahoo Finance earlier this year Monaco discussed several of the challenges now faced by sovereign nations ""During the pandemic you had a significant increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio….We ended 2020 started 2021 with the highest global debt-to-GDP ratio in the world since the end of World War II"" she said.

Coming out of the pandemic her team noticed an important trend: those governments that were highly digitized were better positioned to serve their populations over those who lagged in digitally transforming their economies. Her organization is now advising world governments on how to better digitize their economies to stem coverage gaps especially in rural areas and promote the equitable distribution of resources. Her recent contribution to Citi's report Digitization of Governments  outlines many of the digital transformation challenges that her clients face in emerging markets.

Monaco is co-chair of the International Women of Elliot (IW/E) a leadership group that she helped co-found and launch at George Washington University. In the face of a severe underrepresentation of women receiving master's degrees in foreign policy the IW/E is committed to the career development and advancement of women in international affairs in both the public and private sectors. ""When it comes to solving the biggest problems or conflicts in the world studies show that when women have an equal seat at the table the peace process is more long-lasting"" said Monaco.

The financial industry has changed for the better over the last 20 years Monaco said. She noted that the number of women in Citi's senior ranks has increased dramatically—upwards of 40%—and the fact that men have taken a more active role in raising families which has resulted in more women staying in the workforce. ""Younger men are willing to do things that the previous generation would have never done"" she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcmFiaWFuYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2luZHVzdHJpZXMvYmFua2luZy1maW5hbmNlL2JucC1wYXJpYmFzLWNpdGlncm91cC1nb2xkbWFuLXNhY2hzLWFtb25nLW5ldy1kZWJ0LW1hcmtldC1wcmltYXJ5LWRlYWxlcnMtYXBwb2ludGVkLWJ5LXNhdWRpLWFyYWJpYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BNP Paribas Citigroup Goldman Sachs among new debt market primary dealers appointed by Saudi Arabia,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.arabianbusiness.com/industries/banking-finance/bnp-paribas-citigroup-goldman-sachs-among-new-debt-market-primary-dealers-appointed-by-saudi-arabia on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcmFiaWFuYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2luZHVzdHJpZXMvYmFua2luZy1maW5hbmNlL2JucC1wYXJpYmFzLWNpdGlncm91cC1nb2xkbWFuLXNhY2hzLWFtb25nLW5ldy1kZWJ0LW1hcmtldC1wcmltYXJ5LWRlYWxlcnMtYXBwb2ludGVkLWJ5LXNhdWRpLWFyYWJpYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

While the industry average is about 50 days Citizens can now offer a home equity line of credit in as little as seven days said Johnson chief experience officer for the Providence Rhode Island-based company.

The changes propelled Citizens to the No. 1 market share in the U.S. for home equity originations Johnson said. ""We brought together all of the people that we needed to move quickly and capitalize on that customer insight to bring that to life.""

Johnson who has been in her current role since 2019 has played a leading role in the digital transformation at Citizens and in bringing the bank to new markets including the competitive New York consumer market contributing to a 21% increase in the existing customer base there. She also helped expand the bank's footprint in the high-profile areas of Florida Pennsylvania and Washington D.C. She also serves on the bank's 12-person executive committee and is the executive sponsor of its diversity equity and inclusion program called AWAKE.

While the financial services industry has largely avoided joining TikTok Johnson has embraced the social media platform. The resulting campaign was used as a case study for the social media platform's first-ever ""The State of Fintok"" event and led to 37.5 million impressions and increased the bank's reach to younger consumers.

""If you look at people in their 20s and below they're using it as a major way to find information"" Johnson said.

The bank meanwhile is enhancing its ability to use the information it collects through investments in data analytics and other tools she said. ""That's been able to really fuel customer experiences to drive new business for the organization.""

Johnson has been applying her digital savvy as a board member for The Home for Little Wanderers a Boston-based child welfare organization. She has helped the nonprofit hone its brand message and adapt new technologies in delivering service.

There has been a lot of social media controversy recently over a method of making pumpkins last longer—by wiping them down with bleach diluted in water. While it would be unwise to use unadulterated bleach because of its drying properties on the pumpkin and potential effect on surrounding soil or surfaces a teaspoon of bleach mixed with a gallon of water won’t be toxic to animals once it’s dry as many detractors claim.

Bleach is toxic when it’s wet safe when dry

Wiping pumpkins with diluted bleach works because it kills the bacteria on the surface of the pumpkin slowing down its decomposition process. It also helps to discourage mold from growing prolonging the shelf-life of a harvested pumpkin. If you do get some salt residue on the surface of your pumpkin you can use a clean damp cloth to wipe away the salt crystals.

Bleach known by its chemical name as NaClO is toxic in its liquid form but once it dries the leftover residue becomes a harmless salt (NaCl). If bleach residue were as toxic as some people fear think of how dangerous it would be to clean your countertops or your bathroom sink with it. While bleach can be dangerous if not used properly its residue won’t kill wildlife any more than table salt would.

Dangers associated with bleach

If a large amount of bleach is absorbed into soil it can lead to higher salinity resulting in the withering of many plant species so it’s not a good idea to pour or mix bleach on the ground. Some people even use bleach as a weed killer but it’s non-specific meaning that it will kill any plants it comes in contact with. If you do spill some by accident flush the area with lots of fresh water to avoid creating a problem for local flora.

In addition not diluting bleach or using it in an enclosed environment can cause toxic fumes that are dangerous to humans and pets. It should go without saying that you shouldn’t drink bleach even in its diluted form because it’s still poisonous as a liquid. However using a one teaspoon to one gallon ratio of bleach mixed with fresh water should be relatively safe to use on your pumpkin as long as you don’t get it in your eyes or mouth. (It’s also a good idea to wear gloves while using bleach to keep your hands from drying out.) If you do get bleach on your skin rinse the area thoroughly with fresh water. When mixing bleach if you aren’t sure of the ratio you are using follow the CDC guidelines for safe disinfecting practices.

Never mix bleach with ammonia

A major danger posed by using bleach is the possibility of accidentally mixing it with ammonia which can create deadly fumes and acid. Don’t mix bleach with other cleaning products ever and if you do accidentally mix the two leave the area where it occurred immediately. Seek medical attention after you have inhaled the fumes caused by mixing bleach and ammonia together because the fumes from such an accident can kill you or damage your eyes and mucus membranes.

If you do accidentally ingest bleach or get it in your eye contact your local poison control or dial 911 for any severe symptoms.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhc3RoYW1wdG9uc3Rhci5jb20vYXJ0cy8yMDIyMTA2L3BldGVyLWhlZGdlcy16b29taW5nLWJpZy1zY3JlZW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Peter Hedges: Zooming for the Big Screen,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhc3RoYW1wdG9uc3Rhci5jb20vYXJ0cy8yMDIyMTA2L3BldGVyLWhlZGdlcy16b29taW5nLWJpZy1zY3JlZW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC9B02140>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhc3RoYW1wdG9uc3Rhci5jb20vYXJ0cy8yMDIyMTA2L3BldGVyLWhlZGdlcy16b29taW5nLWJpZy1zY3JlZW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGEuY29tL3VzL2xhdGluYXBvd2VyaG91c2UvMjAyMjEwMDUzMzY1MTgvdmFuZXNhLWFtYXJvL9IBUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGEuY29tL3VzL2xhdGluYXBvd2VyaG91c2UvMjAyMjEwMDUzMzY1MTgvdmFuZXNhLWFtYXJvLz92aWV3YXM9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vanesa Amaro named Top 100 Latina Powerhouse 2022,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGEuY29tL3VzL2xhdGluYXBvd2VyaG91c2UvMjAyMjEwMDUzMzY1MTgvdmFuZXNhLWFtYXJvL9IBUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGEuY29tL3VzL2xhdGluYXBvd2VyaG91c2UvMjAyMjEwMDUzMzY1MTgvdmFuZXNhLWFtYXJvLz92aWV3YXM9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC9B00700>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGEuY29tL3VzL2xhdGluYXBvd2VyaG91c2UvMjAyMjEwMDUzMzY1MTgvdmFuZXNhLWFtYXJvL9IBUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGEuY29tL3VzL2xhdGluYXBvd2VyaG91c2UvMjAyMjEwMDUzMzY1MTgvdmFuZXNhLWFtYXJvLz92aWV3YXM9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vYm9pbmdib2luZy5uZXQvMjAyMi8xMC8wNS9iYW5kLWFpZC1sZWFkcy10aGUtbW9zdC10cnVzdGVkLWJyYW5kcy1pbi10aGUtdW5pdGVkLXN0YXRlcy1oZXJlLWFyZS10aGUtb3RoZXItdG9wLTkuaHRtbNIBf2h0dHBzOi8vYm9pbmdib2luZy5uZXQvMjAyMi8xMC8wNS9iYW5kLWFpZC1sZWFkcy10aGUtbW9zdC10cnVzdGVkLWJyYW5kcy1pbi10aGUtdW5pdGVkLXN0YXRlcy1oZXJlLWFyZS10aGUtb3RoZXItdG9wLTkuaHRtbC9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Band-Aid leads the most trusted brands in the United States.

The Russia-Ukraine war exacerbated an already tight global supply situation that had begun in 2020 with COVID-19-related worker shortages and factory shutdowns the first of several disruptions that sparked volatility in the fertilizer market.

In response to economic sanctions imposed by the international community Russia halted hundreds of exports. While fertilizer exports were not explicitly banned Russia’s Ministry of Industry and Trade recommended that its fertilizer manufacturers temporarily stop exports of their products amid shipping concerns. Russia later announced further export restrictions on fertilizer that will last through May 2023 to secure sufficient supply for domestic farmers. In addition shipping companies as well as Western financing and vessel insurance companies steered away from Russia amid international financial sanctions and safety concerns. The result was that global and U.S. fertilizer prices surged to record levels in March 2022. According to the World Bank global fertilizer prices had risen 30% by early 2022 on the heels of an 80% hike in 2021.

The following figure shows that Bloomberg’s Green Markets Weekly North America Fertilizer Price Index reached an all-time high of 1270.4 on March 25 surging past the former record of 932.3 set in 2008. The index is based on the benchmark prices of three fertilizer ingredients: nitrogen phosphorus and potassium collectively known as NPK.

NOTE: The Green Markets Weekly North America Fertilizer Price Index uses the U.S. Gulf Coast urea U.S. Corn Belt potash and New Orleans (NOLA) barge diammonium phosphate (DAP) benchmark prices and is value-weighted based on annual global demand for each nutrient. Figure data are from Jan. 2 2006 to Sept. 23 2022.

Fertilizer use varies significantly by crop and by soil. On average it accounts for 36% of the operating costs of U.S. corn farmers and 35% of the operating costs of U.S. wheat farmers. Soybeans require less fertilizer and it accounts for only 10% of that crop’s operating costs. More than 50% of farmers surveyed in August by the Purdue University Center for Commercial Agriculture said that higher input cost was their greatest concern for the next crop year while 12% of respondents reported that input availability was their greatest concern. Indeed this spring’s rise in fertilizer prices prompted some farmers to cut back on fertilizer use or to change their crop mix. More farmers may do so next year if the outlook weakens for grain and oilseed prices.

The Interconnectedness of the Global Fertilizer Trade

Synthetic fertilizers have helped triple global grain production since the 1960s. But producing fertilizer components such as nitrogen requires resources like natural gas and others. Some components like phosphorus and potassium are mined. Only a few countries have the right mix of ingredients and access to natural gas to economically produce fertilizer. China Russia the U.S. India and Canada are the world’s five largest producers of fertilizer while Russia Canada the European Union China and Belarus are the world’s five largest exporters.

Disruptions That Helped Upset the Global Fertilizer Cart

Disruptions started to occur in the global fertilizer supply chain mid-2020 when COVID-19 produced labor shortages that hindered natural gas production. More disruptions occurred in February 2021 after a deep freeze covered the U.S. southern Plains and froze natural gas wells. In late August 2021 Hurricane Ida hit the southern U.S. again impacting both natural gas and fertilizer production. Last fall China the world’s largest exporter of phosphorus implemented quotas limiting international shipments of the nutrient that were initially set to end in June 2022. The quotas were recently extended through the end of the year and possibly into mid-2023.

The Russia-Ukraine war has also disrupted natural gas flows. Russia halted exports of natural gas to Bulgaria and Poland in April followed by Finland and the Netherlands in May and Latvia in early August. It also reduced flows to the rest of Europe causing spikes in European natural gas prices that led at least 10 of Europe’s fertilizer plants to close or cut output in July 2022 alone.

Ameliorative Moves

Several developments over the summer relieved supply pressures and reduced fertilizer prices. For example the U.S. International Trade Commission voted on July 18 to reject substantial anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports of urea ammonium nitrate or UAN a key nitrogen product from Russia and Trinidad and Tobago. In 2021 80% of U.S. UAN imports came from these countries.

On July 22 Russia and Ukraine signed separate agreements with Turkey and the U.N. clearing the way for Ukraine to export grain and other agricultural goods while also ensuring that Russian food and fertilizer would have access to world markets. The agreement which expires in November after 120 days but can be renewed included Russian assurances that it would not attack Ukrainian port facilities on the Black Sea. By mid-August the first ships loaded with wheat began departing from Black Sea ports and some fertilizer shipments from Russia had resumed as well.

Repercussions of the Fertilizer Price Shock

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 exacerbated already tight global fertilizer supplies boosting prices to all-time highs in March. While certain ameliorative measures have eased some of the price pressure on U.S. farmers volatility in the natural gas market will likely keep fertilizer prices high for some time.

Given tight supplies and the uncertain geopolitical situation U.S. farmers seeking to price or book their fertilizer needs early for next year’s crop are finding that suppliers have increasingly shifted to a just-in-time pricing structure. In addition both farmers and suppliers are moving toward more-formalized contracts that go beyond handshake or verbal agreements.

Meanwhile the fertilizer price shock has sparked interest in high-tech precision-application tools and equipment that reduce the required amount of fertilizer as well as in biotech solutions like nitrogen-producing microbes that can add nutrients to soil without the need for natural gas during production.

Pursuant to the settlement offer in which Monick LLC neither admitted nor denied the rule violations or factual findings upon which the penalty is based a Panel of the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) Business Conduct Committee found that on multiple occasions between February 28 2020 and April 6 2020 an automated trading system (ATS) operated by Monick entered crossed-market orders in Soybean Soybean Meal Corn and Chicago SRW Wheat futures during the pre-open session due to a programming error and adversely impacted the Indicative Opening Price (IOP).

Market Regulation contacted Monick on multiple occasions after the initial incident regarding its errant messaging activity. Monick was unable to properly correct the programming error and on multiple occasions between April 6 2020 and November 26 2021 the ATS again entered crossed-market orders during the pre-open sessions in Soybean Soybean Meal Corn and Chicago SRW Wheat futures and adversely impacted the IOP.

The Panel found that Monick in failing to implement procedures to prevent the ATS from continually entering and canceling messages during the preopen period failed to properly supervise the ATS. The Panel concluded that Monick thereby violated CBOT Rules 432.W. and 575.D.

In accordance with the settlement offer the Panel ordered Monick to pay a $50000 fine in connection with this case and companion case CME 20-1337-BC ($15000 of which is allocated to CBOT).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitwFodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3Vyc291cmNlb25lLmNvbS9jb2x1bWJpYV9iYXNpbi9jb2R5LWVhc3RlcmRheS1zZW50ZW5jZWQtdG8tMTEteWVhcnMtaW4tcHJpc29uLWZvci1sYXJnZXN0LWV2ZXItY3JpbWluYWwtZnJhdWQtc2NoZW1lLWluL2FydGljbGVfNDFjNzJiZGMtNDQ3MC0xMWVkLWJmNTQtNmZjZWY2ZTgwOGZhLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cody Easterday sentenced to 11 years in prison for largest-ever criminal fraud scheme in eastern WA,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMitwFodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3Vyc291cmNlb25lLmNvbS9jb2x1bWJpYV9iYXNpbi9jb2R5LWVhc3RlcmRheS1zZW50ZW5jZWQtdG8tMTEteWVhcnMtaW4tcHJpc29uLWZvci1sYXJnZXN0LWV2ZXItY3JpbWluYWwtZnJhdWQtc2NoZW1lLWluL2FydGljbGVfNDFjNzJiZGMtNDQ3MC0xMWVkLWJmNTQtNmZjZWY2ZTgwOGZhLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018ECA353A00>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitwFodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3Vyc291cmNlb25lLmNvbS9jb2x1bWJpYV9iYXNpbi9jb2R5LWVhc3RlcmRheS1zZW50ZW5jZWQtdG8tMTEteWVhcnMtaW4tcHJpc29uLWZvci1sYXJnZXN0LWV2ZXItY3JpbWluYWwtZnJhdWQtc2NoZW1lLWluL2FydGljbGVfNDFjNzJiZGMtNDQ3MC0xMWVkLWJmNTQtNmZjZWY2ZTgwOGZhLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

In time to address Michigan’s winter heating needs Consumers Energy announced this week that it finished a critical piece of a $260 million revamp to its Freedom Compressor Station in Washtenaw County installing five new natural gas compressor units.

“The upgrades at Freedom Compressor Station are a win for our customers the communities we serve and the planet” said Dennis Dobbs Consumers Energy’s vice president of gas engineering and supply. “Since 2018 we’ve invested about $1 billion annually to modernize our system — a commitment we plan to continue in the coming decade. We are committed to creating a cleaner and more resilient natural gas future for Michigan.”

Part of a larger 10-year $11 billion Natural Gas Delivery Plan at Consumers the upgrade was meant to enhance the transport of natural gas to customers and storage fields in the region. V-12 engines replaced 13 sets of equipment dating back to the 1940s and while those devices have not yet been removed they have been retired. The old will be extricated entirely next year but even now the new devices will allow Consumers to more readily adjust gas flow maintain monitoring and more efficiently reduce air emissions from the system.

“We provide natural gas to more than 4 million people in 45 counties and we’re working to shield those customers from price volatility” Dobbs said. “Our vast storage system allows us to buy large amounts of natural gas when it’s cheapest and pass those savings along to customers during the winter when demand is highest. Freedom Compressor Station and our compression fleet are an invaluable component of that equation.”

Freedom station takes in natural gas to push into a network of around 30000 miles of pipeline. Consumers also oversees a massive underground storage system of 15 fields and nearly 1000 wells.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvcmVuZXdhYmxlcy9ncmVlbmtvLWNvLWZvdW5kZXItbWFoZXNoLWtvbGxpLWtlZW4tdG8tcmV0dXJuLXRvLWxvbmRvbi1tYXJrZXQvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTQ2NDkyMjMuY21z0gGMAWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS9yZW5ld2FibGVzL2dyZWVua28tY28tZm91bmRlci1tYWhlc2gta29sbGkta2Vlbi10by1yZXR1cm4tdG8tbG9uZG9uLW1hcmtldC9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTQ2NDkyMjMuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Greenko co-founder Mahesh Kolli keen to return to London market,"It seems like you're already an ETPrime member with

Employers wishing to support staff with the rising cost of living may consider offering vouchers that can be redeemed for goods.

Benefit in kind legislation means that gifts of this type in contrast to monetary payments can be provided to employees without being subject to income tax and National Insurance deductions.

It is essential that any vouchers can only be redeemed for goods – they cannot be exchanged for cash or be considered as readily-convertible assets by the Income Tax Division.

The limit is £600 and incorporates all benefits provided by an employer in any one tax year. Some employers already use this exemption to reward staff with shopping vouchers.

Treasury Minister Dr Alex Allinson MHK said: ‘We are aware that many employers want to help their staff during what is a challenging period due to rising domestic bills and this is a way to ensure people can receive the full amount being offered.’

The Expenses and Benefits Guide 2021 (Guidance Note 40) explains the position on all benefits in kind and expenses.

The benefit in kind exemption is based on £600 per employee per employer. If the aggregate total of benefits provided exceeds £600 the total value of the benefits provided should be charged to income tax and reported in full on form T9.

India’s September imports of Russian oil rose 18.5% from August after falling for two months making it the country’s second-largest crude supplier after Saudi Arabia  according to energy cargo tracker Vortexa. The import of 879000 barrels per day (bpd) of Russian oil in September is the second highest in a month ever for India after June’s 933000 bpd.“India may consider importing more Russian crude this quarter as refiners ramp up runs to meet the seasonal rise in domestic demand and higher export demand from Europe  but it all hinges on prices of Russian crude offered to them relative to the rival Middle East and West African grades” said Serena Huang  an analyst at Vortexa.Russian oil comprised about 1% of India’s imports before the beginning of the Ukraine war as freight made it uncompetitive but has now climbed to 21%. Indian refiners’ attraction for Russian crude grew after the onset of the Ukraine war as traders offered deep discounts which have since halved to about $5-6 per barrel on a delivered basis.Rising Russian imports have meant a loss of market share for other key exporters such as the US Iraq and the UAE. In September Saudi Arabia was the top supplier to India while Iraq and the UAE were the third and fourth largest respectively. The US the fifth largest supplier now has about 4% of the Indian market down from 10% a year earlier.India has also increased the purchase of Russian refined products with fuel oil imports reaching close to 100000 barrels per day in September up from an average of nearly 60000 bpd in the first quarter of 2022. The country also received its first 90000 tonnes of Russian naphtha cargo at Sikka port last month as per Vortexa.“With a slowing appetite for Russian oil in Europe and limited alternative destinations India is becoming an increasingly important trade partner for Russia” said Huang.Chinese imports of seaborne Russian crude rose 7% month-onmonth to 1 million barrels per day while European imports increased 16% to 950000 bpd. Europe’s import of seaborne Russian crude has halved since the beginning of the year. China and Europe import a substantial amount of Russian crude via pipelines.Russia’s share in the Indian crude market may rise further if the European Union keeps its promise of banning Russian crude imports from December. Discounts on Russian crude are expected to rise with fewer buyers in the market.OPEC+ the producer club is considering a substantial production cut to support the price that has fallen to around $89 per barrel from $124 in June amid fears of a recession in advanced economies. Any significant supply cut may drive up global prices and boost Indian imports of cheaper Russian crude."
